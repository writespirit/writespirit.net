<p>Ion By Euripides</p>
<p>Translated by Robert Potter</p>
<hr />
<p>Dramatis Personae</p>
<p>MERCURY <br />
 ION <br />
 CREUSA, daughter of Erechtheus <br />
 XUTHUS, husband of CREUSA <br />
 TUTOR <br />
 ATTENDANT <br />
 PRIESTESS OF APOLLO <br />
 MINERVA <br />
 CHORUS <br />
 OF HANDMAIDENS OF CREUSA <br />
 <strong></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Before the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The sun is about to rise. MERCURY enters.</em></p>
<p><b>MERCURY</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atlas, that on his brazen shoulders rolls <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yon heaven, the ancient mansion of the gods, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was by a goddess sire to Maia; she <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To supreme Jove bore me, and call&#8217;d me Hermes; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendant on the king, his high behests <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I execute. To Delphi am I come, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This land where Phoebus from his central throne <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utters to mortals his high strain, declaring <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present and the future; this is the cause; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greece hath a city of distinguish&#8217;d glory, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which from the goddess of the golden lance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Received its name; Erechtheus was its king; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His daughter, call&#8217;d Creusa, to the embrace <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of nuptial love Apollo strain&#8217;d perforce, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where northward points the rock beneath the heights <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crown&#8217;d with the Athenian citadel of Pallas, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&#8217;d Macrai by the lords of Attica. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her growing burden, to her sire unknown <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Such was the pleasure of the god,) she bore, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till in her secret chamber to a son <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rolling months gave birth: to the same cave, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where by the enamour&#8217;d god she was compress&#8217;d, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creusa bore the infant: there for death <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exposed him in a well-compacted ark <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of circular form, observant of the customs <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from her great progenitors, and chief <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Erichthonius, who from the Attic earth <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deriv&#8217;d his origin: to him as guards <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minerva gave two dragons, and in charge <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consign&#8217;d him to the daughters of Aglauros: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rite to the Erechthidae hence remains, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid serpents wreathed in ductile gold to nurse <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their children. What of ornament she had <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hung around her son, and left him thus <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To perish. But to me his earnest prayer <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoebus applied, &#8220;To the high-lineaged sons <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of glorious Athens go, my brother; well <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou know&#8217;st the city of Pallas; from the cave <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in the hollow rock a new-born babe, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid as he is, and all his vestments with him; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring to thy brother to my shrine, and place <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the entrance of my temple; of the rest <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For, know, the child is mine) I will take care.&#8221; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To gratify my brother thence I bore <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The osier-woven ark, and placed the boy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here at the temple&#8217;s base, the wreathed lid <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncovering, that the infant might be seen. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It chanced, as the orient sun the steep of heav&#8217;n <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ascended, to the god&#8217;s oracular seat <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priestess entering, on the infant cast <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eye, and marvelled, deeming that some nymph <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Delphi at the fane had dared to lay <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret burden of her womb: this thought <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompts her to move it from the shrine: but soon <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To pity she resign&#8217;d the harsh intent; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impulse of the god secretly acting <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In favour of the child, that in his temple <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might abide; her gentle hand then took it, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave it nurture; yet conceived she not <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Phoebus was the sire, nor who the mother <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knew aught, nor of his parents could the child <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give information. All his youthful years <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sportive he wandered round the shrine, and there <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was fed: but when his firmer age advanced <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To manhood, o&#8217;er the treasures of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Delphians placed him, to his faithful care <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consigning all; and in this royal dome <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hallow&#8217;d life he to this hour hath pass&#8217;d. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime Creusa, mother of the child, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Xuthus was espoused, the occasion this:- <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Athens from Euboean Chalcis roll&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waves of war; be join&#8217;d their martial toil, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with his spear repell&#8217;d the foe; for this <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the proud honour of Creusa&#8217;s bed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanc&#8217;d; no native, in Achaea sprung <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Aeolus, the son of Jove. Long time <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbless&#8217;d with children, to the oracular shrine <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Phoebus are they come, through fond desire <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of progeny: to this the god hath brought <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fortune of his son, nor, as was deem&#8217;d, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgets him; but to Xuthus, when he stands <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sacred seat consulting, will he give <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That son, declared his offspring; that the child, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When to Creusa&#8217;s house brought back, by her <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May be agnized; the bridal rites of Phoebus <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kept secret, that the youth may claim the state <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to his birth, through all the states of Greece <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Named Ion, founder of the colonies <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Asiatic coast. The laurell&#8217;d cave <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now will I visit, there to learn what fortune <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is to the boy appointed, for I see <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This son of Phoebus issuing forth to adorn <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates before the shrine with laurel boughs. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of the gods I hail him by the name <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ion, which his fortune soon will give him.</p>
<p><em>MERCURY vanishes. ION and the attendants of the temple enter</em></p>
<p><b>ION</b> <em>chanting</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now flames this radiant chariot of the sun <br />
  High o&#8217;er the earth, at whose ethereal fire <br />
  The stars into the sacred night retreat: <br />
  O&#8217;er the Parnassian cliffs the ascending wheels <br />
  To mortals roll the beams of day; the wreaths <br />
  Of incense-breathing myrrh mount to the roof <br />
  Of Phoebus&#8217; fane; the Delphic priestess now <br />
  Assumes her seat, and from the hallow&#8217;d tripod <br />
  Pronounces to the Greeks the oracular strains <br />
  Which the god dictates. Haste, ye Delphic train, <br />
  Haste to Castalia&#8217;s silver-streaming fount; <br />
  Bathed in its chaste dews to the temple go; <br />
  There from your guarded mouths no sound be heard <br />
  But of good omen, that to those who crave <br />
  Admission to the oracle, your voice <br />
  May with auspicious words expound the answers. <br />
  My task, which from my early infancy <br />
  Hath been my charge, shall be with laurel boughs <br />
  And sacred wreaths to cleanse the vestibule <br />
  Of Phoebus, on the pavement moistening dews <br />
  To rain, and with my bow to chase the birds <br />
  Which would defile the hallow&#8217;d ornaments. <br />
  A mother&#8217;s fondness, and a father&#8217;s care <br />
  I never knew: the temple of the god <br />
  Claims then my service, for it nurtured me.</p>

<p><em>strophe</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haste, thou verdant new-sprung bough, <br />
  Haste, thy early office know; <br />
  Branch of beauteous laurel come, <br />
  Sweep Apollo&#8217;s sacred dome, <br />
  Cropp&#8217;d this temple&#8217;s base beneath, <br />
  Where the immortal gardens breathe, <br />
  And eternal dews that round <br />
  Water the delicious ground, <br />
  Bathe the myrtle&#8217;s tresses fair. <br />
  Lightly thus, with constant care, <br />
  The pavement of the god I sweep, <br />
  When over the Parnassian steep <br />
  Flames the bright sun&#8217;s mounting ray; <br />
  This my task each rising day. <br />
  Son of Latona, Paean, Paean, hail! <br />
  Never, O never may thy honours fail!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>antistrophe</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grateful is my task, who wait <br />
  Serving, Phoebus, at thy gate; <br />
  Honouring thus thy hallow&#8217;d shrine, <br />
  Honour for the task is mine. <br />
  Labouring with unwilling hands, <br />
  Me no mortal man commands: <br />
  But, immortal gods, to you <br />
  All my pleasing toil is due. <br />
  Phoebus is to me a sire; <br />
  Grateful thoughts my soul inspire; <br />
  Nurtured by thy bounty here, <br />
  Thee, Apollo, I revere; <br />
  As a father&#8217;s I repeat. <br />
  Son of Latona, Paean, Paean, hail! <br />
  Never, O never may thy honours fail!</p>
<p>Now from this labour with the laurel bough <br />
  I cease; and sprinkling from the golden vase <br />
  The chaste drops which Castalia&#8217;s fountain rolls, <br />
  Bedew the pavement. Never may I quit <br />
  This office to the god; or, if I quit it, <br />
  Be it, good Fortune, at thy favouring call! <br />
  But see, the early birds have left their nests, <br />
  And this way from Parnassus wing their flight. <br />
  Come not, I charge you, near the battlements, <br />
  Nor near the golden dome. Herald of Jove, <br />
  Strong though thy beak beyond the feather&#8217;d kind, <br />
  My bow shall reach thee. Towards the altar, see, <br />
  A swan comes sailing: elsewhere wilt thou move <br />
  Thy scarlet-tinctured foot? or from my bow <br />
  The lyre of Phoebus to thy notes attuned <br />
  Will not protect thee; farther stretch thy wings; <br />
  Go, wanton, skim along the Delian lake, <br />
  Or wilt thou steep thy melody in blood. <br />
  Look, what strange bird comes onwards; wouldst thou fix <br />
  Beneath the battlements thy straw-built nest? <br />
  My singing bow shall drive thee hence; begone, <br />
  Or to the banks of Alpheus, gulfy stream, <br />
  Or to the Isthmian grove; there hatch thy young; <br />
  Mar not these pendent ornaments, nor soil <br />
  The temple of the god: I would not kill you: <br />
  &#8216;Twere pity, for to mortal man you bear <br />
  The message of the gods; yet my due task <br />
  Must be perform&#8217;d, and never will I cease <br />
  My service to the god who nurtured me.</p>

<p><em>CREUSA and attendants enter.</em></p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady, whoe&#8217;er thou art, that liberal air <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaks an exalted mind: there is a grace, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dignity in those of noble birth, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That marks their high rank. Yet I marvel much <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That from thy closed lids the trickling tear <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water&#8217;d thy beauteous cheeks, soon as thine eye <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beheld this chaste oracular seat of Phoebus. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What brings this sorrow, lady? All besides, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewing the temple of the god, are struck <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With joy; thy melting eye o&#8217;erflows with tears.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not without reason, stranger, art thou seized <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wonder at my tears: this sacred dome <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakes the sad remembrance of things past. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my mind at home, though present here. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wretched is our sex! And, O ye gods, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What deeds are yours! Where may we hope for right, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If by the injustice of your power undone?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, lady, this inexplicable grief?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It matters not; my mind resumes its firmless: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say no more; cease thy concern for me.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But say, who art thou? whence? what country boasts <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy birth? and by what name may we address thee?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creusa is my name, drawn from Erechtheus <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My high-born lineage; Athens gave me birth. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illustrious is thy state; thy ancestry <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So noble that I look with reverence on thee.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy indeed is this, in nothing farther.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tell me, is it true what fame has blazon&#8217;d?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wouldst thou ask? Stranger, I wish to know.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprung the first author of thy line from the earth?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, Erichthonius; but my race avails not.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did Minerva raise him from the earth?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Held in her virgin hands: she bore him not.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him as the picture represents?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daughters of Cecrops these, charged not to see him.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virgins ope&#8217;d the interdicted chest?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And died, distaining with their blood the rock.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tell me, is this truth, or a vain rumour?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wouldst thou ask? I am not scant of time.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sisters did Erechtheus sacrifice?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slew the virgins, victims for their country.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou of all thy sisters saved alone?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was an infant in my mother&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did the yawning earth swallow thy father?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Neptune&#8217;s trident smote; and so he perish&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Macrai call you not the fatal place?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why dost thou ask? What thoughts hast thou recall&#8217;d?,</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does Phoebus, do his lightnings honour it?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honour! Why this? Would I had never seen it!</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Dost thou hate the place dear to the god?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No: but for some base deed done in the cave.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what Athenian, lady, wedded thee?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Athens none, but one of foreign birth.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is his name? Noble he needs must be.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xuthus, by Aeolus derived from Jove.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How weds a stranger an Athenian born?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euboea is a state neighbouring on Athens.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A narrow sea flows, I have heard, between.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining the Athenian arms, that state he wasted.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confederate in the war, thence wedded thee?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dowral meed of war, earn&#8217;d by his spear.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comest thou with him to Delphi, or alone?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With him, gone now to the Trophonian shrine.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To view it, or consult the oracle?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both that and this, anxious for one response.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the earth&#8217;s fruits consult you, or for children?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though wedded long, yet childless is our bed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou ne&#8217;er borne a child, that thou hast none?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My state devoid of children Phoebus knows.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless&#8217;d in all else, luckless in this alone.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who art thou? Bless&#8217;d I pronounce thy mother.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&#8217;d as I am the servant of the god.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presented by some state, or sold to this?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not aught save this, I am the god&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my turn, stranger, I pity thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As knowing not my mother, or my lineage.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou thy dwelling here, or in some house?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temple is my house, ev&#8217;n when I sleep.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A child brought hither, or in riper years?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An infant, as they say, who seem to know.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Delphian dame sustain&#8217;d thee at her breast?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never knew a breast. She nourish&#8217;d me.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, hapless youth? Diseased, I find disease.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priestess: as a mother I esteem her.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who to these manly years gave thee support?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The altars, and the still-succeeding strangers.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wretched, whoe&#8217;er she be, is she that bore thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I to some woman am perchance a shame.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are riches thine? Thou art well habited.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graced with these vestments by the god I serve.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou made no attempt to trace thy birth?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no token, lady, for a proof.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, like thy mother doth another suffer.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? tell me: shouldst thou help me, what a joy</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One for whose sake I come before my husband.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say for what end, that I may serve thee, lady.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ask a secret answer of the god.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak it: my service shall procure the rest.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear then the tale: but Modesty restrains me.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, let her not; her power avails not here.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend then says that to the embrace of Phoebus-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman and a god! Say not so, stranger.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bore a son: her father knew it not.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so: a mortal&#8217;s baseness he disdains.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This she affirms; and this, poor wretch, she suffer&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What follow&#8217;d, if she knew the god&#8217;s embrace?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child, which hence had birth, she straight exposed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This exposed child, where is he? doth he live?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This no one knows; this wish I to inquire.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not alive, how probably destroyed?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Torn, she conjectures, by some beast of prey.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ground hath she on which to build that thought?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to the place she found him not.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observed she drops of blood distain the path?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None, though with anxious heed she search&#8217;d around.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time hath pass&#8217;d since thus the child was lost?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were he alive, his youth were such as thine.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god hath done him wrong: the unhappy mother-</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath not to any child been mother since.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if in secret Phoebus nurtures him!</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unjust to enjoy alone a common right.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! this cruel fate accords with mine.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thee too thy unhappy mother mourns.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, melt me not to griefs I would forget!</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be silent: but impart thy aid.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seest thou what most the inquiry will suppress?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to my wretched friend what is not ill?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How shall the god what he would hide reveal?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As placed on the oracular seat of Greece.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed must cause him shame: convict him not.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the poor sufferer &#8217;tis the cause of grief.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be; for who shall dare to give <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The oracle? With justice would the god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own dome affronted, pour on him <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severest vengeance, who should answer thee. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desist then, lady: it becomes us ill, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In opposition to the god, to make <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inquiries at his shrine; by sacrifice <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before their altars, or the flight of birds, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we attempt to force the unwilling gods <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To utter what they wish not, &#8217;twere the excess <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of rudeness; what with violence we urge <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;Gainst their consent would to no good avail us: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What their spontaneous grace confers on us, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, lady, as a blessing we esteem.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER OF THE</strong><b>CHORUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How numberless the ills to mortal man, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And various in their form! One single blessing <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By any one through life is scarcely found.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor here, nor there, O Phoebus, art thou just <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her; though absent, yet her words are present. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor didst thou save thy son, whom it became thee <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save; nor, though a prophet, wilt thou speak <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sad mother who inquires of thee; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, if he is no more, to him a tomb <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May rise; but, if he lives, that he may bless <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother&#8217;s eyes. But even thus behooves us <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To omit these things, if by the god denied <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To know what most I wish.-But, for I see <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble Xuthus this way bend, return&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Trophonian cave; before my husband <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume not, generous stranger, this discourse, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest it might cause me shame that thus I act <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret, and perchance lead on to questions <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not have explain&#8217;d. Our hapless sex <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft feel our husbands&#8217; rigour: with the bad <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtuous they confound, and treat us harshly.</p>
<p><em>XUTHUS and his retinue enter.</em></p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With reverence to the god my first address <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pay: Hail, Phoebus! Lady, next to thee: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absent so long, have I not caused thee fear?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much: as anxious thoughts &#8216;gan rise, thou&#8217;rt come. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, tell me, from Trophonius what reply <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearest thou; what means whence offspring may arise?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmeet he held it to anticipate <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer of the god: one thing he told me. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That childless I should not return, nor thou, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home from the oracle.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goddess revered, <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In lucky hour; and our connubial bed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be by thy son made happier than before!</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall be so. But who is president here?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without, that charge is mine; within, devolved <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On others, stranger, seated near the tripod; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chiefs of Delphi these, chosen by lot.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;Tis well: all that I want is then complete. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now enter: for the oracle <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is given, I hear, in common to all strangers <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the shrine; on such a day, that falls <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propitious thus, the answer of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I receive: meanwhile, these laurel boughs <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear round the altars; lady, breathe thy prayers <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To every god, that from Apollo&#8217;s shrine <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may bring back the promise of a son.</p>
<p><em>XUTHUS, after giving the laurel boughs to CREUSA, enters the temple.</em></p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall, it shall be so. Should Phoebus now <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least be willing to redress the fault <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of former times, he would not through the whole <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be friendly to us: yet will I accept <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he vouchsafes us, for he is a god.</p>
<p><em>CREUSA departs to the shrines in the outer precinct of the temple.</em></p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does this stranger always thus revile <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With obscure speech the god? Is it through love <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her, for whom she asks? or to conceal <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some secret of importance? But to me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the daughter of Erechtheus? Naught <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerns it me. Then let me to my task, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sprinkle from the golden vase the dew. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet must I blame the god, if thus perforce <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mounts the bed of virgins, and by stealth <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becomes a father, leaving then his children <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To die, regardless of them. Do not thou <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act thus; but, as thy power is great, respect <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtues; for whoe&#8217;er, of mortal men, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dares impious deeds, him the gods punish: how <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it then just that you, who gave the laws <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mortals, should yourselves transgress those laws?, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (though it is not thus, yet will I urge <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject,)-if to mortals you shall pay <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty of forced embraces, thou, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune, and Jove, that reigns supreme in heaven, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will leave your temples treasureless by paying <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mulcts of your injustice: for unjust <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are, your pleasures to grave temperance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preferring: and to men these deeds no more <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it be just to charge as crimes, these deeds <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If from the gods they imitate: on those <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who gave the ill examples falls the charge.</p>
<p><em>ION goes out.</em></p>

<p>Thee prompt to yield thy lenient aid, <br />

  Descending from thy golden throne above; <br />
  Haste, goddess, to the Pythian dome, <br />
  Where Phoebus, from his central shrine, <br />
  Gives the oracle divine, <br />
  By the raving maid repeated, <br />
  On the hallow&#8217;d tripod seated: <br />
  O haste thee, goddess, and with thee <br />
  The daughter of Latona bring; <br />
  A virgin thou, a virgin she, <br />
  Sisters to the Delphian king; <br />
  Him, virgins, let your vows implore, <br />

  From sire to son transmitted down, <br />
  Shall with fresh glory through their offspring shine, <br />
  And brighten with increased renown: <br />
  A guard, when ills begin to lower, <br />
  Dear in fortune&#8217;s happier hour; <br />
  For their country&#8217;s safety waking, <br />
  Firm in fight the strong spear shaking; <br />
  More than proud wealth&#8217;s exhaustless store, <br />
  More than a monarch&#8217;s bride to reign, <br />
  The dear delight, to virtue&#8217;s lore <br />
  Careful the infant mind to train. <br />
  Doth any praise the childless state? <br />

<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye female train, that place yourselves around <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This incense-breathing temple&#8217;s base, your lord <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awaiting, hath he left the sacred tripod <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And oracle, or stays he in the shrine, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making inquiries of his childless state?</p>
<p><strong>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in the temple, stranger, he remains.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he comes forth; the sounding doors announce <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His near approach; behold, our lord is here.</p>
<p><em>XUTHUS enters from the temple. He rushes to greet ION</em></p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health to my son! This first address is proper.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my health: be in thy senses thou, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And both are well.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O let me kiss thy hand, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw mine arms around thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art thou, stranger, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well in thy wits? or hath the god&#8217;s displeasure <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bereft thee of thy reason?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason bids, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That which is dearest being found, to wish <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fond embrace.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Off, touch me not; thy hands <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will mar the garlands of the god.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My touch <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asserts no pledge: my own, and that most dear, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilt thou not keep thee distant, ere <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast my arrow in thy heart?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why fly me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou shouldst own what is most fond of thee?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not fond of curing wayward strangers, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And madmen.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill me, raise my funeral pyre; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if thou kill me, thou wilt kill thy father.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father thou! how so? it makes me laugh <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear thee.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This my words may soon explain.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wilt thou say to me?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thy father, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou my son.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who declares this?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That nurtured thee, though mine.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou to thyself <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art witness.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the oracle inform&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misled by some dark answer.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I heard it.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What were the words of Phoebus?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That who first <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should meet me-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?-what meeting?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I pass&#8217;d. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the temple.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the event to him?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is my son.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born so, or by some other <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presented?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though a present, born my son.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And didst thou first meet me?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None else, my son.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fortune whence?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that we marvel both.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is my mother?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I cannot say.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not the god inform thee?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through my joy, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this I ask&#8217;d not.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haply from the earth <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sprung, my mother.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, the earth no sons <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Produces.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How then am I thine?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Phoebus I appeal.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be this discourse <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chang&#8217;d to some other.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This delights me most.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou e&#8217;er mounted an unlawful bed?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In foolishness of youth.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that before <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy marriage with the daughter of Erechtheus?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since never.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owe I then my birth to that?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time agrees.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How came I hither then?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can form no conjecture.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was I brought <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From some far distant part?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That fills my mind <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With doubtful musing.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didst thou e&#8217;er before <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit the Pythian rock?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, at the feast <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Bacchus.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By some public host received?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who with the Delphian damsels-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the orgies <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Led thee, or how?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the Maenades <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Bacchus-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the temperate hour, or warm <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wine?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the revels of the god.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From thence I date my birth.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fate, my son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath found thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How then came I to the temple?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance exposed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state of servitude <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I escaped.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy father now, my son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receive.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indecent were it in the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to confide.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy thoughts are just.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would we?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou seest what thou oughtst to see.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I the son then of the son of Jove?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is thy fortune.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that gave me birth <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I embrace?</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obedient to the god.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father, hail!</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That dear name I accept <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With joy.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This present day-</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath made me happy.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my dear mother, when shall I behold <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy face? Whoe&#8217;er thou art, more wish I now <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see thee than before; but thou perchance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art dead, and nothing our desires avail.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the blessing of our house rejoice. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet wish we that our mistress too were happy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In children, and the lineage of Erechtheus.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well hath the god accomplish&#8217;d this, my son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discovering thee, well hath he joined thee to me; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou hast found the most endearing ties, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which, before this hour, thou wast a stranger. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the warm wish, which thou hast well conceived, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is likewise mine, that thou mayst find thy mother; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I from what woman thou derivest thy birth. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, left to time, may haply be discover&#8217;d. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now quit this hallow&#8217;d earth, the god no more <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending, and to mine accord thy mind, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To visit Athens, where thy father&#8217;s sceptre, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mean one, waits thee, and abundant wealth: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor, though thou grieve one parent yet unknown, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalt thou be censured as ignobly born, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or poor: no, thou art noble, and thy state <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adorn&#8217;d with rich possessions. Thou art silent. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is thine eye thus fixed upon the ground? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why on thy brow that cloud? The smile of joy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanish&#8217;d, thou strikest thy father&#8217;s heart with fear.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far other things appear when nigh, than seen <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At distance. I indeed embrace my fortune, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In thee my father found. But hear what now <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakes sad reflections. Proud of their high race <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are your Athenians, natives of the land, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not drawn from foreign lineage: I to them <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall come unwelcome, in two points defective, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father not a native, and myself <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of spurious birth: loaded with this reproach, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If destitute of power, I shall be held <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abject and worthless: should I rush among <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest order of the state, and wish <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To appear important, inferior ranks <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will hate me; aught above them gives disgust. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good, the wise, men form&#8217;d to serve the state, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are silent, nor at public honours aim <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too hastily: by such, were I not quiet <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a bustling state, I should be deem&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ridiculous, and proverb&#8217;d for a fool. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I attain the dignity of those, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose approved worth hath raised them to the height <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of public honours, by such suffrage more <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I be watch&#8217;d; for they that hold in states <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule and pre-eminence, bear hostile minds <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To all that vie with them. And should I come <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a strange house a stranger, to a woman <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childless herself, who that misfortune shared <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before with thee, now sees it her sole lot, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And feels it bitterly, would she not hate me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that with justice? When I stand before them. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what an eye would she, who hath no child, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look on thy child? In tenderness to her, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy wife, thou must forsake me, or embroil <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy house in discord, if thou favour me. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What murderous means, what poisonous drugs for men <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have women with inventive rage prepared! <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, I have much pity for thy wife, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now growing old without a child, that grief <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmerited, the last of her high race, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exterior face indeed of royalty, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So causelessly commended, bath its brightness; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within, all gloom: for what sweet peace of mind, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happiness is his, whose years are pass&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comfortless suspicion, and the dread <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of violence? Be mine the humble blessings <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of private life, rather than be a king, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the flagitious forced to choose my friends, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hate the virtuous through the fear of death. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold, thou mayst tell me, hath o&#8217;er things like these <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sovereign power, and riches give delight: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no pleasure in this noisy pomp, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor, while I guard my riches, in the toil: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be mine a modest mean that knows not care. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, my father, hear the happy state <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I here enjoy&#8217;d; and first, to mortal man <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That dearest blessing, leisure, and no bustle <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cause disturbance: me no ruffian force <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoved from the way: it is not to be borne, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When every insolent and worthless wretch <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes you give place. The worship of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employ&#8217;d my life, or (no unpleasing task) <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service to men well pleased: the parting guest <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bade farewell-welcomed the new-arrived. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus something always new made every hour <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glide sweetly on; and to the human mind <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That dearest wish, though some regard it not, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be, what duty and my nature made me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to the god: revolving this, my father, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish not for thy Athens to exchange <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This state; permit me to myself to live; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear to the mind pleasures that arise <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From humble life, as those which greatness brings.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well hast thou said, if those whom my soul holds <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most dear shall in thy words find happiness.</p>
<p><b>XUTHUS</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more of this discourse; learn to be happy. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my will that thou begin it here, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where first I found thee, son: a general feast <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I provide, and make a sacrifice, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which at thy birth I made not: at my table <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I receive thee as a welcome guest, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cheer thee with the banquet, then conduct the <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Athens with me as a visitant, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not as my son: for, mid my happiness, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not grieve my wife, who hath no child.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will watch the occasions time may bring, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so present thee, and obtain her leave <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us then go; yet one thing to my fortune <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wanting: if I find not her that bore me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life hath no joy. Might I indulge a wish, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It were to find her an Athenian dame, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That from my mother I might dare to assume <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some confidence; for he whose fortune leads him <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a free state proud of their unmix&#8217;d race, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though call&#8217;d a citizen, must close his lips <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With servile awe, for freedom is not his.</p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father, while he lived, revered, advance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the oracular seat thy aged steps; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, if the royal Phoebus should pronounce <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promise of offspring, thou with me mayst share <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The joy; for pleasing is it when with friends <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good fortune we receive; if aught of ill <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Avert it, Heaven!) befalls, a friend&#8217;s kind eye <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beams comfort; thee, as once thou didst revere <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father, though thy queen, I now revere.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In thee, my child, the nobleness of manners <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which graced thy royal ancestors yet lives; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou never wilt disgrace thy high-born lineage. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead me, then, lead me to the shrine, support me: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High is the oracular seat, and steep the ascent; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be thou assistant to the foot of age.</p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the will, but o&#8217;er constraint no power.</p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borne hence? if good, declare it: you shall find <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy fortune! <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why distress me for the oracle <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In things which threaten death, what shall we do?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee, my queen, it is not given to clasp <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In thy fond arms a child, or at thy breast <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my child, would I were dead!</p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from the land of Greece, ev&#8217;n to the stars <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What piercing grief is mine I</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, by what name <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he address his son, if thou hast heard it? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does it rest in silence, yet unknown?</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion, for that he first advanced to meet him.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of what mother?</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I could not learn: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abrupt was his departure (to inform thee <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all I know, old man) to sacrifice, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With hospitable rites, a birthday feast; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the hallow&#8217;d cave, from her apart, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his new son to share the common banquet.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady, we by thy husband are betrayed, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I with thee am grieved, with contrived fraud <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insulted, from thy father&#8217;s house cast forth. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak not this in hatred to thy lord, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that I love thee more: a stranger he <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came to the city and thy royal house, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wedded thee, all thy inheritance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receiving, by some other woman now <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discover&#8217;d to have children privately: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How privately I&#8217;ll tell thee: when he saw <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hadst no child, it pleased him not to bear <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fate like thine; but by some favourite slave, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His paramour by stealth, he hath a son. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him to some Delphian gave he, distant far, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To educate; who to this sacred house <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consign&#8217;d, as secret here, received his nurture. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knowing this, and that his son advanced <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To manhood, urged thee to attend him hither, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading thy childless state. Nor hath the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deceived thee: he deceived thee, and long since <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrived this wily plan to rear his son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, if convicted, he might charge the god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Himself excusing: should the fraud succeed, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would observe the times when he might safely <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consign to him the empire of thy land. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this new name was at his leisure form&#8217;d, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion, for that he came by chance to meet him. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate those ill-designing men, that form <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plans of injustice, and then gild them over <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With artificial ornament: to me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far dearer is the honest simple friend, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than one whose quicker wit is train&#8217;d to ill. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to complete this fraud, thou shalt be urged <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take into thy house, to lord it there, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This low-born youth, this offspring of a slave. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though ill, it had been open, had he pleaded <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy want of children, and, thy leave obtain&#8217;d, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought to thy house a son that could have boasted <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother noble; or, if that displeased thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might have sought a wife from Aeolus. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behooves thee then to act a woman&#8217;s part, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or grasp the sword, or drug the poison&#8217;d bowl, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or plan some deep design to kill thy husband, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this his son, before thou find thy death <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From them: if thou delay, thy life is lost: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For when beneath one roof two foes are met, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one must perish. I with ready zeal <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will aid thee in this work, and kill the youth, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the grot where he prepares the feast; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indifferent in my choice, so that I pay <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What to my lords I owe, to live or die. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is aught that causes slaves to blush, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the name; in all else than the free <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The slave is nothing worse, if he be virtuous. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I too, my honour&#8217;d queen, with cheerful mind <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will share thy fate, or die, or live with honour.</p>

  The hallow&#8217;d lake by Triton form&#8217;d, no longer <br />
  Will I conceal this bed, but ease my breast, <br />
  The oppressive load discharged. Mine eyes drop tears, <br />

  Thy locks all glittering, as the vermeil flowers <br />

  With the spring&#8217;s glowing hues; in my white hand <br />

  My mother; on thou led&#8217;st me, wanton god, <br />
  Immodestly, to Venus paying homage. <br />
  A son I bare thee, O my wretched fate! <br />
  Him (for I fear&#8217;d my mother) in thy cave <br />
  I placed, where I unhappy was undone <br />
  By thy unhappy love. Woe, woe is me! <br />
  And now my son and thine, ill-fated babe, <br />
  Is rent by ravenous vultures; thou, meanwhile, <br />
  Art to thy lyre attuning strains of joy. <br />
  Set of Latona, thee I call aloud <br />
  Who from thy golden seat, thy central throne, <br />
  Utterest thine oracle: my voice shall reach <br />
  Thine ear: ungrateful lover, to my husband, <br />
  No grace requiting, thou hast given a son <br />
  To bless his house; my son and thine, unown&#8217;d, <br />
  Perish&#8217;d a prey to birds; the robes that wrapp&#8217;d <br />
  The infant&#8217;s limbs, his mother&#8217;s work, lost with him. <br />
  Delos abhors thee, and the laurel boughs <br />
  With the soft foliage of the palm o&#8217;erhung, <br />
  Grasping whose round trunk with her hands divine, <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go with speed: but where shall it be done?</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hallow&#8217;d tent, where now he feasts his friends.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An open murder, and with coward slaves!</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If mine displease, propose thou some design.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have it, close and easy to achieve.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both my faithful services are thine.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear then: not strange to thee the giants&#8217; war.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they in Phlegra fought against the gods.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There the earth brought forth the Gorgon, horrid monster.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In succour of her sons to annoy the gods?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev&#8217;n so: her Pallas slew, daughter of Jove.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What fierce and dreadful form did she then wear?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her breastplate arm&#8217;d with vipers wreathed around.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-known story; often have I heard it.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spoils before her breast Minerva wore.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aegis; so they call the vest of Pallas.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So named, when in the war she join&#8217;d the gods.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how can this, my child, annoy thy foes?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou canst not but remember Erichthonius.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom first of thy high race the earth brought forth.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him while yet an infant Pallas gave-</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What? Thy slow preface raises expectation.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two drops of blood that from the Gorgon fell.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the human frame what power have these?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one works death, the other heals disease.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what around the infant&#8217;s body hung?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enclosed in gold: he gave them to my father.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his decease then they devolved to thee?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, and I wear it as a bracelet; look.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their double qualities how temper&#8217;d, say.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This drop, which from her hollow vein distill&#8217;d,-</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what effect applied? What is its power?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicinal, of sovereign use to life.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other drop, what faculties hath that?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It kills, the poison of the Gorgon dragons.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dost thou bear this gore blended in one?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, separate; for with ill good mixes not.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my dear child, thou hast whate&#8217;er we want.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this the boy shall die, and thou shalt kill him.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where? How? &#8216;Tis thine to speak, to dare be mine.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Athens, when he comes beneath my roof.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like not this; what I proposed displeased.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dost thou surmise what enters now my thoughts?</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspicion waits thee, though thou kill him not.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast judged well: a stepdame&#8217;s hate is proverb&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then kill him here; thou mayst disown the deed.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind ev&#8217;n now anticipates the pleasure.</p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus shalt thou meet thy husband&#8217;s wiles with wiles</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shalt thou do: this little golden casket <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take from my hand, Minerva&#8217;s gift of old; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To where my husband secretly prepares <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacrifice, bear this beneath thy vest. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That supper ended, when they are to pour <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libations to the gods, thou mayst infuse <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the youth&#8217;s goblet this: but take good heed, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let none observe thee; drug his cup alone <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who thinks to lord it in my house: if once <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It pass his lips, his foot shall never reach <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illustrious Athens: death awaits him here.</p>
<p><em>She gives him the casket.</em></p>
<p><b>TUTOR</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go thou then to the hospitable house <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepared for thy reception: be it mine, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obedient to thy word to do this deed. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come then, my aged foot, be once more young <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In act, though not in years, for past recall <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That time is fled: kill him, and bear him forth. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well may the prosperous harbour virtuous thought; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when thou wouldst avenge thee on thy foes, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no law of weight to hinder thee.</p>
<p><em>They both go out.</em></p>

<p><em>An ATTENDANT of CREUSA enters.</em></p>
<p><b>ATTENDANT</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athenian dames, where shall I find our queen, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter of Erechtheus? Seeking her, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This city have I walked around in vain.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for what cause, my fellow-slave? What means <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy hasty foot? What tidings dost thou bring?</p>
<p><b>ATTENDANT</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are discover&#8217;d; and the rulers here <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek her, that she may die o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d with stones.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! what wouldst thou say? Are our designs <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of secret ruin to this youth disclosed?</p>
<p><b>ATTENDANT</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are; and know, the worst of ills await you.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How were our dark devices brought to light?</p>
<p><b>ATTENDANT</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god, that justice might receive no stain <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caused it to triumph o&#8217;er defeated wrong.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How? as a suppliant, I conjure thee, tell me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this inform&#8217;d, if we must die, more freely <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish we to die than see the light of heaven.</p>
<p><b>ATTENDANT</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon as the husband of Creusa left <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god&#8217;s oracular shrine, this new-found son <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He to the feast, and sacrifice prepared <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the high gods, led with him. Xuthus then <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went where the hallow&#8217;d flame of Bacchus mounts, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on each rock&#8217;s high point the victim&#8217;s blood <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might flow, a grateful offering for his son <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus recognised, to whom he gave in charge, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Stay thou, and with the artist&#8217;s expert aid <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erect the sheltering tent: my rites perform&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the kind gods that o&#8217;er the genial bed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preside, should I be there detain&#8217;d too long, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread the rich table to my present friends.&#8221; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This said, he led the victims to the rocks. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile with reverent heed the son &#8216;gan rear <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On firm supporters the wide tent, whose sides <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No masonry require, yet framed to exclude <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mid-day sun&#8217;s hot beams, or his last rays <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When sinking in the west: the lengthen&#8217;d lines <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally distant comprehend a square <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of twice five thousand feet (the skilful thus <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compute it), space to feast (for so he will&#8217;d) <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Delphi: from the treasures of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the sacred tapestry, and around <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung the rich shade, on which the admiring eye <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gazes with fix&#8217;d delight: first over head, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a broad pennon spread the extended woof, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which from the Amazonian spoils the son <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Jove, Alcides, hallow&#8217;d to the god; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its bright texture interwov&#8217;n a sky <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathering the stars in its ethereal round, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While downwards to the western wave the sun <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His steeds declines, and to his station high <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draws up the radiant flame of Hesperus. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile the Night robed in her sable stole, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her unreign&#8217;d car advances; on her state <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars attend; the Pleiads mounting high, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with his glittering sword Orion arm&#8217;d; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above, Arcturus to the golden pole <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclines; full-orb&#8217;d the month-dividing moon <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Takes her bright station, and the Hyades <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marked by the sailor: distant in the rear, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aurora ready to relume the day, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And put the stars to flight. The sides were graced <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With various textures of the historic woof, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbaric arguments; in gallant trim <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the fleet of Greece the hostile fleet <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rides proudly on. Here monstrous forms portray&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human and brutal mix&#8217;d: the Thracian steeds <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are seized, the hinds, and the adventurous chase <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of savage lions: figured nigh the doors, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecrops, attended by his daughter&#8217;s, roll&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His serpent train: in the ample space within <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spread the festal table, richly deck&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With golden goblets. Now the herald walk&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His round, each native that inclined to grace <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feast inviting: to the crowded tent <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hasten, crown&#8217;d with garlands, and partake <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exquisite repast. The pleasured sense <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now satiate, in the midst an old man stood, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officious in his ministry, which raised <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much mirth among the guests; for from the urns <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fill&#8217;d the lavers, and with fragrant myrrh <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incensed the place; the golden bowls he claim&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His charge. When now the jocund pipes &#8216;gan breathe <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmonious airs, and the fresh goblet stood <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to walk its round, the old man said, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Away with these penurious cups, and bring <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacious bowls; so shall you quickly bathe <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your spirits in delight.&#8221; With speed were brought <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goblets of gold and silver: one he took <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of choicer frame; and, seemingly intent <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do his young lord honour, the full vase <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave to his hands, but in the wine infused <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drug of poisonous power, which, it is said, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His queen supplied, that the new son no more <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might view the light of heav&#8217;n; but unobserved <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mix&#8217;d it. As the youth among the rest <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour&#8217;d the libation, &#8216;mid the attendant slaves <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words of reproach one utter&#8217;d: he, as train&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the temple and with expert seers, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deem&#8217;d them of evil omen, and required <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another goblet to be filled afresh- <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former a libation to the god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cast upon the ground, instructing all <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To pour, like him, the untasted liquor down. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence ensued: the sacred bowls we fill <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wines of Byblos; when a troop of doves <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came fluttering in, for undisturb&#8217;d they haunt <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dome of Phoebus: in the floating wine <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They dipp&#8217;d their bills to drink, then raised their heads,</p>
<p>Gurgling it down their beauteous-plumed throats. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmless to all the spilt wine, save to her <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That lighted where the youth had pour&#8217;d his bowl: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank, and straight convulsive shiverings seized <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beauteous plumes; around in giddy rings <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whirl&#8217;d, and in a strange and mournful note <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seem&#8217;d to lament: amazement seized the guests, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the poor bird&#8217;s pangs: her heart heaved thick, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretching out her scarlet legs, she died. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rending his robes, the son of Phoebus given <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprung from the table, and aloud exclaim&#8217;d,- <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What wretch design&#8217;d to kill me? Speak, old man: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officious was thy ministry; the bowl <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I from thy hand received.&#8221; Then straight he seized <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His aged arm, and to the question held him, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the fact discover&#8217;d: he thus caught, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reluctant and constrain&#8217;d, own&#8217;d the bold deed, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadly goblet by Creusa drugg&#8217;d. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the tent, the guests attending, rush&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth announced by Phoebus, and amid <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pythian regents says,-&#8221;O hallow&#8217;d land! <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This stranger dame, this daughter of Erechtheus <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempts my life by poison.&#8221; Then decreed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Delphian lords (nor did one voice dissent) <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she should die, my mistress, from the rock <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast headlong, as the deed was aim&#8217;d against <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred life, and impiously presumed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hallow&#8217;d place with murder to profane. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demanded by the state, she this way bends <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her wretched steps. Unhappy to this shrine <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came through fond desire of children; here, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with her hopes, her life is lost.</p>
<p><b>CHORUS</b> <em>singing</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>None, there is none, from death no flight, <br />
  To me no refuge; our dark deed <br />

<p><em>CREUSA rushes in.</em></p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pursued, ye faithful females, doom&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To death: the Pythian council hath decreed it: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life is forfeited.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy lady, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the dreadful ills that close thee round.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, whither shall I fly? From instant death <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce hath my foot sped hither, from my foes <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By stealth escaping.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whither wouldst thou fly, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to this altar?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will that avail me?</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kill a suppliant there the law forbids.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by the law I perish.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If their hands <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now take thy seat <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the altar: shouldst thou die ev&#8217;n there, thy blood <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That spilt it: but our fortune we must bear.</p>
<p><em>She takes refuge at the altar as ION, guards, and Delphians enter.</em></p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bull-visaged sire Cephisus, what a viper <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou produced? a dragon from her eyes <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glaring pernicious flame. Each daring deed <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is hers: less venomous the Gorgon&#8217;s blood, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With which she purposed to have poison&#8217;d me. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seize her, that the Parnassian rocks may tease <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those nice-adjusted ringlets of her hair, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As down the craggy precipice she bounds. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here my good genius saved me, e&#8217;er I came <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Athens, there beneath my stepdame&#8217;s wiles <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fall; amid my friends thy fell intents <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I unravell&#8217;d, what a pest to me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy hate how deadly: had thy toils inclosed me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In thine own house, thou wouldst at once have sent me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With complete ruin to the shades below. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nor the altar nor Apollo&#8217;s shrine <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall save thee. Pity, might her voice be heard, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would rather plead for me and for my mother, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She absent, yet the name remains with me. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold that sorceress; with what art she wove <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wile after wile; the altar of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impress&#8217;d her not with awe, as if secure. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No vengeance waited her unhallow&#8217;d deeds.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I charge thee, kill me not, in my own right, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the god&#8217;s, whose suppliant here I stand.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What right hast thou to plead Apollo&#8217;s name?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My person hallow&#8217;d to the god I offer.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet wouldst thou poison one that is the god&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wast no more Apollo&#8217;s, but thy father&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been, of a father&#8217;s wealth I speak.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I am: thou hast that claim no more.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou art impious: pious were my deeds.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As hostile to my house, I would have kill&#8217;d thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I against thy country march in arms?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And more; thou wouldst have fired Erechtheus&#8217; house.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What torch, what brands, what flames had I prepared?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There wouldst thou fix, seizing my right by force.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land which he possess&#8217;d, my father gave me.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What claim hath there the race of Aeolus?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was its guardian, not with words but arms.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its soldier then; an inmate, not its lord.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldst thou, through fear of what might happen, kill me?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest death should be my portion, if not thine.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childless thou enviest that my father found me.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wilt thou make a childless house thy spoil?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devolves my father then no share to me?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His shield, his spear; be those thine heritage.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come from the altar, quit that hallow&#8217;d seat.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instruct thy mother, whosoe&#8217;er she be.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalt thou unpunish&#8217;d meditate my death?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within this shrine if thou wilt murder me.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What pleasure mid these sacred wreaths to die?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall grieve one, by whom we have been grieved.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange, that the god should give these laws to men,</p>
<p>Bearing no stamp of honour, nor design&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With provident thought: it is not meet to place <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unrighteous at his altars; worthier far <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be chased thence; nor decent that the vile <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should with their touch pollute the gods: the good, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppress&#8217;d with wrongs, should at those hallow&#8217;d seats <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek refuge: ill beseems it that the unjust <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just alike should seek protection there.</p>
<p><em>As ION and his followers are about to tear CREUSA from the altar, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PRIESTESS of Apollo enters from the temple.</em></p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbear, my son, leaving the oracular seat, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pass this pale, the priestess of the god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guardian of the tripod&#8217;s ancient law, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&#8217;d to this charge from all the Delphian dames.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail, my loved mother, dear, though not my parent.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet let me have the name, &#8217;tis grateful to me.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou yet heard their wily trains to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have; but void of mercy thou dost wrong.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I not ruin those that sought my life?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepdames to former sons are always hostile.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I to stepdames ill intreated thus.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be not, this shrine now leaving for thy country.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How, then, by thy monition should I act?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go with good omens, pure to Athens go.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All must be pure that kill their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So do not thou: attentive mark my words.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak: from good will whate&#8217;er thou say&#8217;st must flow.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seest thou the vase I hold beneath mine arm?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see an ancient ark entwined with wreaths.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this long since an infant I received thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What say&#8217;st thou? New is thy discourse and strange.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In silence have I kept them: now I show them.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why conceal&#8217;d, as long since thou received&#8217;st me?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god would have thee in his shrine a servant.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that no more his will? How shall I know it?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy father shown, he sends thee from this land.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou preserved these things by charge, or how?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the god that so disposed my thought.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what design? Speak, finish thy discourse.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev&#8217;n to this hour to keep what then I found.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What gain imports this to me, or what loss?</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There didst thou lie wrapp&#8217;d in thy infant vests.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast produced whence I may find my mother.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since now the god so wills, but not before.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a day of bless&#8217;d discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>PRIESTESS</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now take them: o&#8217;er all Asia, and the bounds <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Europe hold thy progress: thou shalt know <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tokens. To do pleasure to the god, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nurtured thee, my son; now to thy hand <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restore what was his will I should receive <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbidden, and preserve: for what intent <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was his will, I have not power to say. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I had these, or where they were conceal&#8217;d, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mortal knew. And now farewell: the love <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bear thee equals what a parent feels. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy inquiries where they ought begin; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, if some Delphian virgin gave thee birth, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in this shrine exposed thee; next, if one <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Greece. From me, and from the god, who feels <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interest in thy fortune, thou hast all.</p>
<p><em>She goes into the temple after giving ION the ark</em></p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! the moist tear trickles from mine eye, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I reflect that she who gave me birth, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By stealth espoused, may with like secrecy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have sold me, to my infant lips her breast <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denied: but in the temple of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a name, a servile life I led. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All from the god was gracious, but from fortune <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh; for the time when in a mother&#8217;s arms <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I in her fondness should have known some joy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of life, from that sweet care was I estranged, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother&#8217;s nurture: nor less wretched she, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus forced to lose the pleasure in her son. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will take this vase, and to the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear it, a hallow&#8217;d offering; that from thence <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may find nothing which I would not find. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should she, that gave me being, chance to be <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slave, to find her were a greater ill, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to rest silent in this ignorance. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Phoebus, in thy temple hang I this. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What am I doing? War I not against <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasure of the god, who saved for me <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These pledges of my mother? I must dare, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And open these: my fate cannot be shunn&#8217;d.</p>
<p><em>He opens the ark</em></p>
<p>Ye sacred garlands, what have you so long <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceal&#8217;d: ye bands, that keep these precious relics? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold the cover of this circular vase; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its freshness knows no change, as if a god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So will&#8217;d; this osier-woven ark yet keeps <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its soundness undecay&#8217;d; yet many a year, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it contain&#8217;d this treasured charge, has pass&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What an unhoped-for sight do I behold!</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought thou long hadst known to keep thee silent.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence is mine no more; instruct not me; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I behold the ark, wherein of old <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid thee, O my son, an infant babe; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the caves of Cecrops, with the rocks <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Macrai roof&#8217;d, exposed thee: I will quit <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This altar, though I run on certain death.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seize her; for by the impulse of the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She leaves the sculptured altar: bind her bands.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instantly kill me, so that I embrace <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This vase, and thee, and these thy conceal&#8217;d pledges.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not this strange? I take thee at thy word.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not strange: a friend thou by thy friends art found.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy friend! Yet wouldst thou kill me secretly.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son: if that to parents is most dear.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbear thy wiles; I shall refute them well.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might I but to come to what I wish, my son!</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this vase empty, or contains it aught?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy infant vests, in which I once exposed thee.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wilt thou name them to me, ere thou see them?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I recount them not, be death my meed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak then: thy confidence hath something strange.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tissue, look, which when a child I wrought.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it? Various are the works of virgins.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slight, unfinish&#8217;d essay of the loom.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What figure wrought? Thou shalt not take me thus.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Gorgon central in the warp enwoven-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What fortune haunts me, O supreme of gods!</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And like an aegis edged with serpents round.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the woof, and such the vest I find.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou old embroidery of my virgin bands!</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there aught else besides this happy proof?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two dragons, an old work, their jaws of gold.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gift of Pallas, who thus nurtures children?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emblems of Erichthonius of old times.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? for what use? Explain these works of gold.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ornaments to grace the infant&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See, here they are; the third I wish to know.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A branch of olive then I wreathed around thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pluck&#8217;d from that tree which from Minerva&#8217;s rock <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First sprung; if it be there, it still retains <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its verdure: for the foliage of that olive, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh in immortal beauty, never fades.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my dear mother! I with joy behold thee. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With transport &#8216;gainst thy cheek my cheek recline.</p>
<p><em>They embrace.</em></p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son, my son, far dearer to thy mother <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than yon bright orb (the god will pardon me) , <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I then hold thee in my arms, thus found <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond my hopes, when in the realms below, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought thy habitation &#8216;mong the dead?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O my dear mother, in thy arms I seem <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one that had been dead to life return&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye wide-expanded rays of heavenly light, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What notes, what high-raised strains shall tell my joy? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This pleasure whence, this unexpected transport?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no blessing farther from my thoughts <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than this, my mother, to be found thy son.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tremble yet.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hast thou yet a fear, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding me, not to hold me?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such fond hopes <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long time have I renounced. Thou hallow&#8217;d matron, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom didst thou receive my infant child? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What bless&#8217;d hand brought him to Apollo&#8217;s shrine?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the god&#8217;s appointment: may our life <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To come be happy, as the past was wretched.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not without tears, my son, wast thou brought forth; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor without anguish did my hands resign thee. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now breathing on thy cheek I feel a joy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transporting me with heartfelt ecstasies.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words expressive of thy joys speak mine.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childless no more, no more alone, my house <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now shines with festive joy; my realms now own <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lord; Erechtheus blooms again; no more <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His high-traced lineage sees night darkening round, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But glories in the sun&#8217;s refulgent beams.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let my father, since he&#8217;s present here, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be partner of the joy which I have given you.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What says my son?</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such, such as I am proved.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What mean thy words? Far other is thy birth.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! thy virgin bed produced me base.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor bridal torch, my son, nor bridal dance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had graced my nuptial rites, when thou wast born.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I&#8217;m a wretch, a base-born wretch: say whence.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be witness, thou by whom the Gorgon died,-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What means this adjuration?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who hast fix&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High o&#8217;er my cave thy seat amid the rocks <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With olive clothed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstruse thy words, and dark.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where on the cliffs the nightingale attunes <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her songs, Apollo-</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why Apollo named?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Led me in secret to his bed.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak on; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy words import some glorious fortune to me.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee in the tenth revolving month, my son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A secret pang to Phoebus did I bear.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy words, if true, are grateful to my soul.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These swathing bands, thy mother&#8217;s virgin work, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wove by my flying shuttle, round thy body <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I roll&#8217;d; but from thy lips my breast withheld, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother&#8217;s nouriture, nor bathed thy bands <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cleansing lavers; but to death exposed thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid in the dreary cave, to birds of prey <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A feast, rent piecemeal by their ravenous beaks.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruel, my mother, was thy deed.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By fear <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constrain&#8217;d, my son, I cast thy life away; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unwillingly I left thee there to die.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from my hands unholy were thy death.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreadful was then my fortune, dreadful here, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whirl&#8217;d by the eddying blast from misery there <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To misery here, and back again to joy: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boisterous winds are changed; may she remain <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this repose: enough of ills are past: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the storm soft breathes a favouring gale.</p>
<p><strong>LEADER</strong> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this example, mid the greatest ills <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never let mortal man abandon hope.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou, that hast to thousands wrought a change <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of state ere this, involving them in ills, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And raising them to happiness again; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortune, to what a point have I been carried, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to kill my mother, horrid thought! <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the sun&#8217;s bright course each day affords <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instruction. Thee, my mother, have I found, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that discovery bless&#8217;d; nor hath my birth <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aught I can blame: yet one thing would I say <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee alone:-walk this way: to thine ear <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret would I whisper this, and throw <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The veil of darkness o&#8217;er each circumstance. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take heed, my mother, lest thy maiden fault <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeks in these secret nuptials to conceal <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its fault, then charges on the god the deed; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, fearing my reproach, to Phoebus gives <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A son, to Phoebus whom thou didst not bear.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By her, who &#8216;gainst the giants in her car <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fought by the side of Jove, victorious Pallas, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one of mortal race is father to thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he who brought thee up, the royal Phoebus.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why give his son then to another father? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why say that I was born the son of Xuthus?</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not born the son of Xuthus; but he gives thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born from himself as friend to friend may give <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His son, and heir adopted to his house.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True is the god, his tripod else were vain. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not without cause then is my mind perplex&#8217;d.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear what my thoughts suggest: to work thee good <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apollo placed thee in a noble house. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acknowledged his, the rich inheritance <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not be thine, nor could a father&#8217;s name; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I conceal&#8217;d my nuptials, and had plann&#8217;d <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kill thee secretly: for this the god <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In kindness gives thee to another father.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind is prompt to entertain such thoughts; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, entering at his shrine will I inquire <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If from a mortal father I am sprung, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or from Apollo.-Ha! what may this be? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What god above the hallow&#8217;d dome unveils <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His radiant face that shines another sun? <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste, let us fly: the presence of the gods <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;Tis not for mortals to behold, and live.</p>
<p><em>MINERVA appears from above</em></p>
<p><b>MINERVA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly not; in me no enemy you fly; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Athens friendly to you, and no less <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here. From that land I come, so named from me, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Phoebus sent with speed: unmeet he deems it <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To show himself before you, lest with blame <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past be mention&#8217;d; this he gave in charge, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell thee that she bore thee, and to him, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoebus thy father; he to whom he gave thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not as to the author of thy being gives thee, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the inheritance of a noble house. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This declaration made, lest thou shouldst die, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill&#8217;d by thy mother&#8217;s wily trains, or she <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By thee, these means to save you he devised. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things in silence long conceal&#8217;d, at Athens <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The royal Phoebus would have made it known <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou art sprung from her, thy father he: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to discharge my office, and unfold <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The oracle of the god, for which you yoked <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your chariots, hear: Creusa, take thy son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the land of Cecrops: let him mount <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The royal throne; for, from Erechtheus sprung, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That honour is his due, the sovereignty <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over my country: through the states of Greece <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide his renown shall spread; for from his root <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four sons shall spring, that to the land, the tribes, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dwellers on my rock, shall give their names. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geleon the first, Hopletes, Argades, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from my aegis named Aegicores: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sons in fate&#8217;s appointed time shall fix <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their seats along the coast, or in the isles <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girt by the Aegean sea, and to my land <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give strength; extending thence the opposite plains <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of either continent shall make their own, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Europe and Asia, and shall boast their name <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ionians, from the honour&#8217;d Ion call&#8217;d. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee by Xuthus shall a son be born, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dorus, from whom the Dorian state shall rise <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To high renown; in the Pelopian land, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another near the Rhian cliffs, along <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea-wash&#8217;d coast, his potent monarchy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall stretch, Achaeus; and his subject realms <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall glory in their chief&#8217;s illustrious name. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well hath Apollo quitted him in all: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, without pain he caused thee bear a son. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That from thy friends thou mightst conceal his birth; <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the birth, soon as his infant limbs <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy hands had clothed, to Mercury he gave <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charge to take the babe, and in his arms <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convey him hither; here with tenderness <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nurtured him, nor suffer&#8217;d him to perish. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard now the secret that he is thy son, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That his opinion Xuthus may enjoy <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delighted: thou too hast thy blessings, lady. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, farewell: from this relief from ills <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prosperous fortune I to both announce.</p>
<p><b>ION</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Pallas, daughter of all-powerful Jove! <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not with distrust shall we receive thy words: <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am convinced that Phoebus is my father, <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother she, not unassured before.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear me too, now: Phoebus I praise, before <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unpraised; my son he now restores, of whom <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till now I deem&#8217;d him heedless. Now these gates <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are beauteous to mine eyes; his oracles <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now grateful to my soul, unpleasant late. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rapture on these sounding rings my hands <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now hang; with rapture I address the gates.</p>
<p><b>MINERVA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This I approve, thy former wayward thoughts <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resign&#8217;d, with honour that thou name the god. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow are the gifts of Heaven, but found at length <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not void of power.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son, let us now go <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Athens.</p>
<p><b>MINERVA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go; myself will follow you.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A noble guard, and friendly to the state.</p>
<p><b>MINERVA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But seat him high on thy paternal throne.</p>
<p><b>CREUSA</b> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rich possession, and I glory in him.</p>
<p><em>MINERVA disappears</em></p>
<p><b>CHORUS</b> singing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of Latona and all-powerful Jove, <br />
  Apollo, hail! Though fortune&#8217;s blackest storms <br />
  Rage on his house, the man whose pious soul <br />
  Reveres the gods, assumes a confidence, <br />
  And justly: for the good at length obtain <br />
  The meed of virtue; but the unholy wretch <br />
  (Such is his nature) never can be happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE END</p>
