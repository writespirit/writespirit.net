 Scene II. A room in the Castle.</p>
<p><em>[Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]</em></p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br />
 Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br />
 The need we have to use you did provoke<br />
 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br />
 Of Hamlet&#8217;s transformation; so I call it,<br />
 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man<br />
 Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br />
 More than his father&#8217;s death, that thus hath put him<br />
 So much from the understanding of himself,<br />
 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both<br />
 That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br />
 And since so neighboured to his youth and humour,<br />
 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br />
 Some little time: so by your companies<br />
 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br />
 So much as from occasion you may glean,<br />
 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br />
 That, opened, lies within our remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,<br />
 And sure I am two men there are not living<br />
 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br />
 To show us so much gentry and good-will<br />
 As to expend your time with us awhile,<br />
 For the supply and profit of our hope,<br />
 Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br />
 As fits a King&#8217;s remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Both your majesties<br />
 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br />
 Put your dread pleasures more into command<br />
 Than to entreaty.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 We both obey,<br />
 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,<br />
 To lay our service freely at your feet,<br />
 To be commanded.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:<br />
 And I beseech you instantly to visit<br />
 My too-much-changed son. &#8211; Go, some of you,<br />
 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 Heavens make our presence and our practices<br />
 Pleasant and helpful to him!</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 Ay, amen!</p>
<p><em>[Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].</em></p>
<p><em>[Enter Polonius.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,<br />
 Are joyfully returned.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,<br />
 I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br />
 Both to my God and to my gracious King:<br />
 And I do think, &#8211; or else this brain of mine<br />
 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br />
 As it hath us&#8217;d to do, &#8211; that I have found<br />
 The very cause of Hamlet&#8217;s lunacy.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Give first admittance to the ambassadors;<br />
 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Polonius.]</em></p>
<p>He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found<br />
 The head and source of all your son&#8217;s distemper.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 I doubt it is no other but the main, &#8211; <br />
 His father&#8217;s death and our o&#8217;erhasty marriage.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Well, we shall sift him.</p>
<p><em>[Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]</em></p>
<p>Welcome, my good friends!<br />
 Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p>
<p><strong>Voltimand</strong><br />
 Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br />
 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br />
 His nephew&#8217;s levies; which to him appeared<br />
 To be a preparation &#8216;gainst the Polack;<br />
 But, better look&#8217;d into, he truly found<br />
 It was against your highness; whereat griev&#8217;d, &#8211; <br />
 That so his sickness, age, and impotence<br />
 Was falsely borne in hand, &#8211; sends out arrests<br />
 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br />
 Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,<br />
 Makes vow before his uncle never more<br />
 To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br />
 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br />
 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;<br />
 And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br />
 So levied as before, against the Polack:<br />
 With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br />
 <em>[Gives a paper.]</em><br />
 That it might please you to give quiet pass<br />
 Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br />
 On such regards of safety and allowance<br />
 As therein are set down.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 It likes us well;<br />
 And at our more considered time we&#8217;ll read,<br />
 Answer, and think upon this business.<br />
 Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:<br />
 Go to your rest; at night we&#8217;ll feast together:<br />
 Most welcome home!</p>
<p><em>[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 This business is well ended. &#8211; <br />
 My liege, and madam, &#8211; to expostulate<br />
 What majesty should be, what duty is,<br />
 Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.<br />
 Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.<br />
 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br />
 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br />
 I will be brief: &#8211; your noble son is mad:<br />
 Mad call I it; for to define true madness,<br />
 What is&#8217;t but to be nothing else but mad?<br />
 But let that go.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 More matter, with less art.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br />
 That he is mad, &#8217;tis true: &#8217;tis true &#8217;tis pity;<br />
 And pity &#8217;tis &#8217;tis true: a foolish figure;<br />
 But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br />
 Mad let us grant him then: and now remains<br />
 That we find out the cause of this effect;<br />
 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br />
 For this effect defective comes by cause:<br />
 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.<br />
 Perpend.<br />
 I have a daughter, &#8211; have whilst she is mine, &#8211; <br />
 Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br />
 Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.<br />
 <em>[Reads.]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;To the celestial, and my soul&#8217;s idol, the most beautified<br />
  Ophelia,&#8217; -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; &#8216;beautified&#8217; is a vile<br />
 phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:<br />
 <em>[Reads.]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.<br />
 <em>[Reads.]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br />
  Doubt that the sun doth move;<br />
  Doubt truth to be a liar;<br />
  But never doubt I love.<br />
  &#8216;O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to<br />
  reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe<br />
  it. Adieu.<br />
  &#8216;Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,<br />
  HAMLET.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in obedience, hath my daughter showed me;<br />
 And more above, hath his solicitings,<br />
 As they fell out by time, by means, and place,<br />
 All given to mine ear.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 But how hath she<br />
 Received his love?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 What do you think of me?</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br />
 When I had seen this hot love on the wing, &#8211; <br />
 As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br />
 Before my daughter told me, &#8211; what might you,<br />
 Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br />
 If I had played the desk or table-book,<br />
 Or given my heart a winKing, mute and dumb;<br />
 Or looked upon this love with idle sight; &#8211; <br />
 What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br />
 And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br />
 &#8216;Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;<br />
 This must not be:&#8217; and then I precepts gave her,<br />
 That she should lock herself from his resort,<br />
 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br />
 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br />
 And he, repulsed, &#8211; a short tale to make, &#8211; <br />
 Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;<br />
 Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;<br />
 Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,<br />
 Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br />
 And all we wail for.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Do you think &#8217;tis this?</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 It may be, very likely.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Hath there been such a time, &#8211; I&#8217;d fain know that &#8211; <br />
 That I have positively said &#8221;Tis so,&#8217;<br />
 When it prov&#8217;d otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Not that I know.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br />
 <em>[Points to his head and shoulder.]</em><br />
 If circumstances lead me, I will find<br />
 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br />
 Within the centre.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 How may we try it further?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 You know sometimes he walks for hours together<br />
 Here in the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 So he does indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 At such a time I&#8217;ll loose my daughter to him:<br />
 Be you and I behind an arras then;<br />
 Mark the encounter: if he love her not,<br />
 And he not from his reason fall&#8217;n thereon<br />
 Let me be no assistant for a state,<br />
 But keep a farm and carters.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 We will try it.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Away, I do beseech you, both away<br />
 I&#8217;ll board him presently: &#8211; O, give me leave.</p>
<p><em>[Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Enter Hamlet, reading.]</em></p>
<p>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Well, God-a-mercy.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Excellent well; you&#8217;re a fishmonger.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Not I, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Honest, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man<br />
 picked out of ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 That&#8217;s very true, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing<br />
 carrion, &#8211; Have you a daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 I have, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Let her not walk i&#8217; the sun: conception is a blessing, but not<br />
 as your daughter may conceive: &#8211; friend, look to&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 How say you by that? &#8211; <em>[Aside.]</em> Still harping on my daughter: &#8211; yet<br />
 he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far<br />
 gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity<br />
 for love; very near this. I&#8217;ll speak to him again. &#8211; What do you<br />
 read, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Words, words, words.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Between who?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men<br />
 have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes<br />
 purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a<br />
 plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,<br />
 sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it<br />
 not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,<br />
 should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 [Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in&#8217;t. &#8211; <br />
 Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Into my grave?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Indeed, that is out o&#8217; the air. <em>[Aside.]</em> How pregnant sometimes<br />
 his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which<br />
 reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I<br />
 will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between<br />
 him and my daughter. &#8211; My honourable lord, I will most humbly take<br />
 my leave of you.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more<br />
 willingly part withal, &#8211; except my life, except my life, except my<br />
 life.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Fare you well, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 These tedious old fools!</p>
<p><em>[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 <em>[To Polonius.]</em>God save you, sir!</p>
<p><em>[Exit Polonius.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 My honoured lord!</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 My most dear lord!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,<br />
 Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 Happy in that we are not over-happy;<br />
 On fortune&#8217;s cap we are not the very button.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Neither, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her<br />
 favours?</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 Faith, her privates we.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a<br />
 strumpet. What&#8217;s the news?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 None, my lord, but that the world&#8217;s grown honest.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me<br />
 question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,<br />
 deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison<br />
 hither?</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 Prison, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Denmark&#8217;s a prison.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Then is the world one.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and<br />
 dungeons, Denmark being one o&#8217; the worst.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 We think not so, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why, then &#8217;tis none to you; for there is nothing either good<br />
 or bad but thinKing makes it so: to me it is a prison.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Why, then, your ambition makes it one; &#8217;tis too narrow for your<br />
 mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a<br />
 King of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of<br />
 the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that<br />
 it is but a shadow&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch&#8217;d<br />
 heroes the beggars&#8217; shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my<br />
 fay, I cannot reason.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</strong><br />
 We&#8217;ll wait upon you.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my<br />
 servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most<br />
 dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what<br />
 make you at Elsinore?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:<br />
 and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were<br />
 you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free<br />
 visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why, anything &#8211; but to the purpose. You were sent for; and<br />
 there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties<br />
 have not craft enough to colour: I know the good King and queen<br />
 have sent for you.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 To what end, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights<br />
 of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the<br />
 obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a<br />
 better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with<br />
 me, whether you were sent for or no.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 <em>[To Guildenstern.]</em>What say you?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 <em>[Aside.]</em> Nay, then, I have an eye of you. &#8211; If you love me, hold<br />
 not off.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your<br />
 discovery, and your secrecy to the King and queen moult no<br />
 feather. I have of late, &#8211; but wherefore I know not, &#8211; lost all my<br />
 mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so<br />
 heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,<br />
 seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the<br />
 air, look you, this brave o&#8217;erhanging firmament, this majestical<br />
 roof fretted with golden fire, &#8211; why, it appears no other thing<br />
 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a<br />
 piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in<br />
 faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in<br />
 action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the<br />
 beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what<br />
 is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman<br />
 neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why did you laugh then, when I said &#8216;Man delights not me&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten<br />
 entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them<br />
 on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 He that plays the King shall be welcome, &#8211; his majesty shall<br />
 have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and<br />
 target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall<br />
 end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose<br />
 lungs are tickle o&#8217; the sere; and the lady shall say her mind<br />
 freely, or the blank verse shall halt for&#8217;t. What players are<br />
 they?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Even those you were wont to take such delight in, &#8211; the<br />
 tragedians of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 How chances it they travel? their residence, both in<br />
 reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late<br />
 innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the<br />
 city? Are they so followed?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 No, indeed, are they not.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,<br />
 sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top<br />
 of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for&#8217;t: these are<br />
 now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages, &#8211; so they call<br />
 them, &#8211; that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and<br />
 dare scarce come thither.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 What, are they children? who maintains &#8216;em? How are they<br />
 escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can<br />
 sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow<br />
 themselves to common players, &#8211; as it is most like, if their means<br />
 are no better, &#8211; their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim<br />
 against their own succession?</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation<br />
 holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for<br />
 awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player<br />
 went to cuffs in the question.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Do the boys carry it away?</p>
<p>Rosencrantz<br />
 Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and<br />
 those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give<br />
 twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in<br />
 little. &#8216;Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if<br />
 philosophy could find it out.</p>
<p><em>[Flourish of trumpets within.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 There are the players.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the<br />
 appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply<br />
 with you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I<br />
 tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like<br />
 entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father<br />
 and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>
<p><strong>Guildenstern</strong>.<br />
 In what, my dear lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I<br />
 know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>
<p><em>[Enter Polonius.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Well be with you, gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Hark you, Guildenstern; &#8211; and you too; &#8211; at each ear a hearer: that<br />
 great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Happily he&#8217;s the second time come to them; for they say an old<br />
 man is twice a child.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. &#8211; You<br />
 say right, sir: o&#8217; Monday morning; &#8217;twas so indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in<br />
 Rome, -</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Buzz, buzz!</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Upon my honour, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Then came each actor on his ass, -</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,<br />
 history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,<br />
 tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene<br />
 individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor<br />
 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are<br />
 the only men.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 What treasure had he, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why &#8211; <br />
 &#8216;One fair daughter, and no more,<br />
 The which he loved passing well.&#8217;</p>
<p>
 <strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 <em>[Aside.]</em>Still on my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Am I not i&#8217; the right, old Jephthah?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I<br />
 love passing well.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Nay, that follows not.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 What follows, then, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why &#8211; <br />
 &#8216;As by lot, God wot,&#8217;<br />
 and then, you know,<br />
 &#8216;It came to pass, as most like it was &#8211; &#8216;<br />
 The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look<br />
 where my abridgment comes.</p>
<p><em>[Enter four or five Players.]</em></p>
<p>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: &#8211; I am glad to see thee<br />
 well. &#8211; welcome, good friends. &#8211; O, my old friend! Thy face is<br />
 valanc&#8217;d since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in<br />
 Denmark? &#8211; What, my young lady and mistress! By&#8217;r lady, your<br />
 ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the<br />
 altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of<br />
 uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. &#8211; Masters, you are<br />
 all welcome. We&#8217;ll e&#8217;en to&#8217;t like French falconers, fly at<br />
 anything we see: we&#8217;ll have a speech straight: come, give us a<br />
 taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong><br />
 What speech, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I heard thee speak me a speech once, &#8211; but it was never acted;<br />
 or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased<br />
 not the million, &#8217;twas caviare to the general; but it was, &#8211; as I<br />
 received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in<br />
 the top of mine, &#8211; an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,<br />
 set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said<br />
 there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,<br />
 nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of<br />
 affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as<br />
 sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it<br />
 I chiefly loved: &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it<br />
 especially where he speaks of Priam&#8217;s slaughter: if it live in<br />
 your memory, begin at this line; &#8211; let me see, let me see: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th&#8217; Hyrcanian beast, -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is not so: &#8211; it begins with Pyrrhus: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;The rugged Pyrrhus, &#8211; he whose sable arms,<br />
  Black as his purpose,did the night resemble<br />
  When he lay couched in the ominous horse, &#8211; <br />
  Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#8217;d<br />
  With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br />
  Now is be total gules; horridly trick&#8217;d<br />
  With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br />
  Bak&#8217;d and impasted with the parching streets,<br />
  That lend a tyrannous and a damned light<br />
  To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,<br />
  And thus o&#8217;ersized with coagulate gore,<br />
  With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br />
  Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, proceed you.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 &#8216;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good<br />
 discretion.</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anon he finds him,<br />
  Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,<br />
  Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br />
  Repugnant to command: unequal match&#8217;d,<br />
  Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br />
  But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br />
  The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br />
  Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br />
  Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash<br />
  Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear: for lo! his sword,<br />
  Which was declining on the milky head<br />
  Of reverend Priam, seem&#8217;d i&#8217; the air to stick:<br />
  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;<br />
  And, like a neutral to his will and matter,<br />
  Did nothing.<br />
  But as we often see, against some storm,<br />
  A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br />
  The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br />
  As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br />
  Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus&#8217; pause,<br />
  A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br />
  And never did the Cyclops&#8217; hammers fall<br />
  On Mars&#8217;s armour, forg&#8217;d for proof eterne,<br />
  With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#8217; bleeding sword<br />
  Now falls on Priam. &#8211; <br />
  Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br />
  In general synod, take away her power;<br />
  Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br />
  And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br />
  As low as to the fiends!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 This is too long.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 It shall to the barber&#8217;s, with your beard. &#8211; Pr&#8217;ythee say on. &#8211; <br />
 He&#8217;s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: &#8211; say on; come<br />
 to Hecuba.</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong><br />
 But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 &#8216;The mobled queen&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 That&#8217;s good! &#8216;Mobled queen&#8217; is good.</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames<br />
  With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br />
  Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br />

  A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; &#8211; <br />
  Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep&#8217;d,<br />
  &#8216;Gainst Fortune&#8217;s state would treason have pronounc&#8217;d:<br />
  But if the gods themselves did see her then,<br />
  When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br />
  In mincing with his sword her husband&#8217;s limbs,<br />
  The instant burst of clamour that she made, &#8211; <br />
  Unless things mortal move them not at all, &#8211; <br />
  Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br />
  And passion in the gods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Look, whether he has not turn&#8217;d his colour, and has tears in&#8217;s<br />
 eyes. &#8211; Pray you, no more!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 &#8216;Tis well. I&#8217;ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. &#8211; <br />
 Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you<br />
 hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief<br />
 chronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a<br />
 bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Odd&#8217;s bodikin, man, better: use every man after his<br />
 desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own<br />
 honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in<br />
 your bounty. Take them in.</p>
<p><strong>Polonius</strong><br />
 Come, sirs.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Follow him, friends. we&#8217;ll hear a play to-morrow.</p>
<p><em>[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]</em></p>
<p>Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play &#8216;The Murder of<br />
 Gonzago&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong><br />
 Ay, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 We&#8217;ll ha&#8217;t to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a<br />
 speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and<br />
 insert in&#8217;t? could you not?</p>
<p><strong>First Player</strong><br />
 Ay, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Very well. &#8211; Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.</p>
<p><em>[Exit First Player.]</em></p>
<p>- My good friends <em>[to Rosencrantz and Guildensternd.]</em>, I&#8217;ll leave you till<br />
 night: you are welcome to Elsinore.</p>
<p><strong>Rosencrantz</strong><br />
 Good my lord!</p>
<p><em>[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Ay, so, God b&#8217; wi&#8217; ye!<br />
 Now I am alone.<br />
 O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br />
 Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br />
 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br />
 Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br />
 That from her worKing all his visage wan&#8217;d;<br />
 Tears in his eyes, distraction in&#8217;s aspect,<br />
 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br />
 With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!<br />
 For Hecuba?<br />
 What&#8217;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br />
 That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br />
 Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br />
 That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br />
 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;<br />
 Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;<br />
 Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,<br />
 The very faculties of eyes and ears.<br />
 Yet I,<br />
 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br />
 Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br />
 And can say nothing; no, not for a King<br />
 Upon whose property and most dear life<br />
 A damn&#8217;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br />
 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br />
 Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?<br />
 Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i&#8217; the throat<br />
 As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?<br />
 &#8216;Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br />
 But I am pigeon-liver&#8217;d, and lack gall<br />
 To make oppression bitter; or ere this<br />
 I should have fatted all the region kites<br />
 With this slave&#8217;s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br />
 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br />
 O, vengeance!<br />
 Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br />
 That I, the son of a dear father murder&#8217;d,<br />
 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br />
 Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words<br />
 And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br />
 A scullion!<br />
 Fie upon&#8217;t! foh! &#8211; About, my brain! I have heard<br />
 That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,<br />
 Have by the very cunning of the scene<br />
 Been struck so to the soul that presently<br />
 They have proclaim&#8217;d their malefactions;<br />
 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br />
 With most miraculous organ, I&#8217;ll have these players<br />
 Play something like the murder of my father<br />
 Before mine uncle: I&#8217;ll observe his looks;<br />
 I&#8217;ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br />
 I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br />
 May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br />
 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br />
 Out of my weakness and my melancholy, &#8211; <br />
 As he is very potent with such spirits, &#8211; <br />
 Abuses me to damn me: I&#8217;ll have grounds<br />
 More relative than this. &#8211; the play&#8217;s the thing<br />
 Wherein I&#8217;ll catch the conscience of the King</p>
<p><em>[Exit.]<br />
 </em></p>
