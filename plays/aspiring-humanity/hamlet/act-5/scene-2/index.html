<p>Scene II. A hall in the Castle.</p>
<p><em>[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;<br />
 You do remember all the circumstance?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Remember it, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting<br />
 That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<br />
 Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,<br />
 And prais&#8217;d be rashness for it, &#8211; let us know,<br />
 Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,<br />
 When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us<br />
 There&#8217;s a divinity that shapes our ends,<br />
 Rough-hew them how we will.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 That is most certain.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Up from my cabin,<br />
 My sea-gown scarf&#8217;d about me, in the dark<br />
 Grop&#8217;d I to find out them: had my desire;<br />
 Finger&#8217;d their packet; and, in fine, withdrew<br />
 To mine own room again: making so bold,<br />
 My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br />
 Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,<br />
 O royal knavery! an exact command, &#8211; <br />
 Larded with many several sorts of reasons,<br />
 Importing Denmark&#8217;s health, and England&#8217;s too,<br />
 With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, &#8211; <br />
 That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br />
 No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,<br />
 My head should be struck off.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Here&#8217;s the commission: read it at more leisure.<br />
 But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 I beseech you.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Being thus benetted round with villanies, &#8211; <br />
 Or I could make a prologue to my brains,<br />
 They had begun the play, &#8211; I sat me down;<br />
 Devis&#8217;d a new commission; wrote it fair:<br />
 I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br />
 A baseness to write fair, and labour&#8217;d much<br />
 How to forget that learning; but, sir, now<br />
 It did me yeoman&#8217;s service. Wilt thou know<br />
 The effect of what I wrote?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 An earnest conjuration from the king, &#8211; <br />
 As England was his faithful tributary;<br />
 As love between them like the palm might flourish;<br />
 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear<br />
 And stand a comma &#8216;tween their amities;<br />
 And many such-like as&#8217;s of great charge, &#8211; <br />
 That, on the view and know of these contents,<br />
 Without debatement further, more or less,<br />
 He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br />
 Not shriving-time allow&#8217;d.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 How was this seal&#8217;d?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br />
 I had my father&#8217;s signet in my purse,<br />
 Which was the model of that Danish seal:<br />
 Folded the writ up in the form of the other;<br />
 Subscrib&#8217;d it: gave&#8217;t the impression; plac&#8217;d it safely,<br />
 The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br />
 Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br />
 Thou know&#8217;st already.</p>
<p>Horatio<br />
 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br />
 They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br />
 Does by their own insinuation grow:<br />
 &#8216;Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br />
 Between the pass and fell incensed points<br />
 Of mighty opposites.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Why, what a king is this!</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Does it not, thinks&#8217;t thee, stand me now upon, &#8211; <br />
 He that hath kill&#8217;d my king, and whor&#8217;d my mother;<br />
 Popp&#8217;d in between the election and my hopes;<br />
 Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br />
 And with such cozenage &#8211; is&#8217;t not perfect conscience<br />
 To quit him with this arm? and is&#8217;t not to be damn&#8217;d<br />
 To let this canker of our nature come<br />
 In further evil?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 It must be shortly known to him from England<br />
 What is the issue of the business there.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 It will be short: the interim is mine;<br />
 And a man&#8217;s life is no more than to say One.<br />
 But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br />
 That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br />
 For by the image of my cause I see<br />
 The portraiture of his: I&#8217;ll court his favours:<br />
 But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br />
 Into a towering passion.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Peace; who comes here?</p>
<p><em>[Enter Osric.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 No, my good lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Thy state is the more gracious; for &#8217;tis a vice to know him. He<br />
 hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and<br />
 his crib shall stand at the king&#8217;s mess; &#8217;tis a chough; but, as I<br />
 say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should<br />
 impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your<br />
 bonnet to his right use; &#8217;tis for the head.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 I thank your lordship, t&#8217;is very hot.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 No, believe me, &#8217;tis very cold; the wind is northerly.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, &#8211; as &#8217;twere &#8211; I cannot<br />
 tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that<br />
 he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the<br />
 matter, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I beseech you, remember, -</p>
<p><em>[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here<br />
 is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute<br />
 gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft<br />
 society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he<br />
 is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the<br />
 continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; &#8211; though, I<br />
 know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of<br />
 memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.<br />
 But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great<br />
 article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make<br />
 true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else<br />
 would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more<br />
 rawer breath?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Sir?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Is&#8217;t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do&#8217;t,<br />
 sir, really.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Of Laertes?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 His purse is empty already; all&#8217;s golden words are spent.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Of him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 I know, you are not ignorant, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not<br />
 much approve me. &#8211; Well, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in<br />
 excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on<br />
 him by them, in his meed he&#8217;s unfellowed.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 What&#8217;s his weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Rapier and dagger.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 That&#8217;s two of his weapons: &#8211; but well.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 The king, sir, hath wager&#8217;d with him six Barbary horses:<br />
 against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French<br />
 rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and<br />
 so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,<br />
 very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of<br />
 very liberal conceit.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 What call you the carriages?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could<br />
 carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.<br />
 But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their<br />
 assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that&#8217;s the French<br />
 bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between<br />
 your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath<br />
 laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial<br />
 if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 How if I answer no?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,<br />
 it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be<br />
 brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,<br />
 I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my<br />
 shame and the odd hits.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Shall I re-deliver you e&#8217;en so?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 I commend my duty to your lordship.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Yours, yours.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Osric.]</em></p>
<p>He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else<br />
 for&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 He did comply with his dug before he suck&#8217;d it. Thus has he, &#8211; and<br />
 many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on, &#8211; <br />
 only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;<br />
 a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and<br />
 through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow<br />
 them to their trial, the bubbles are out,</p>
<p><em>[Enter a Lord.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Lord</strong><br />
 My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,<br />
 who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends<br />
 to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you<br />
 will take longer time.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king&#8217;s pleasure:<br />
 if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided<br />
 I be so able as now.</p>
<p><strong>Lord</strong><br />
 The King and Queen and all are coming down.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 In happy time.</p>
<p><strong>Lord</strong><br />
 The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to<br />
 Laertes before you fall to play.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 She well instructs me.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Lord.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in<br />
 continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not<br />
 think how ill all&#8217;s here about my heart: but it is no matter.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Nay, good my lord, -</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as<br />
 would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their<br />
 repair hither, and say you are not fit.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Not a whit, we defy augury: there&#8217;s a special providence in<br />
 the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, &#8217;tis not to come; if it be<br />
 not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:<br />
 the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,<br />
 what is&#8217;t to leave betimes?</p>
<p><em>[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with foils &amp;c.]</em></p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</p>
<p><em>[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:<br />
 But pardon&#8217;t, as you are a gentleman.<br />
 This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,<br />
 How I am punish&#8217;d with sore distraction.<br />
 What I have done<br />
 That might your nature, honour, and exception<br />
 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br />
 Was&#8217;t Hamlet wrong&#8217;d Laertes? Never Hamlet:<br />
 If Hamlet from himself be ta&#8217;en away,<br />
 And when he&#8217;s not himself does wrong Laertes,<br />
 Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br />
 Who does it, then? His madness: if&#8217;t be so,<br />
 Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong&#8217;d;<br />
 His madness is poor Hamlet&#8217;s enemy.<br />
 Sir, in this audience,<br />
 Let my disclaiming from a purpos&#8217;d evil<br />
 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts<br />
 That I have shot my arrow o&#8217;er the house<br />
 And hurt my brother.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 I am satisfied in nature,<br />
 Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most<br />
 To my revenge. But in my terms of honour<br />
 I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement<br />
 Till by some elder masters of known honour<br />
 I have a voice and precedent of peace<br />
 To keep my name ungor&#8217;d. But till that time<br />
 I do receive your offer&#8217;d love like love,<br />
 And will not wrong it.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I embrace it freely;<br />
 And will this brother&#8217;s wager frankly play. &#8211; <br />
 Give us the foils; come on.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Come, one for me.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I&#8217;ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance<br />
 Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,<br />
 Stick fiery off indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 You mock me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 No, by this hand.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br />
 You know the wager?</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Very well, my lord;<br />
 Your grace has laid the odds o&#8217; the weaker side.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 I do not fear it; I have seen you both;<br />
 But since he&#8217;s better&#8217;d, we have therefore odds.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</p>
<p><em>[They prepare to play.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Set me the stoups of wine upon that table, &#8211; <br />
 If Hamlet give the first or second hit,<br />
 Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br />
 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;<br />
 The king shall drink to Hamlet&#8217;s better breath;<br />
 And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br />
 Richer than that which four successive kings<br />
 In Denmark&#8217;s crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br />
 And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br />
 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br />
 The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br />
 &#8216;Now the king drinks to Hamlet.&#8217; &#8211; Come, begin: &#8211; <br />
 And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Come on, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Come, my lord.</p>
<p><em>[They play.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 One.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 No.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Judgment!</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Well; &#8211; again.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Stay, give me drink. &#8211; Hamlet, this pearl is thine;<br />
 Here&#8217;s to thy health. -</p>
<p><em>[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]</em></p>
<p>Give him the cup.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I&#8217;ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. &#8211; <br />
 Come. &#8211; Another hit; what say you?</p>
<p><em>[They play.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 A touch, a touch, I do confess.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Our son shall win.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 He&#8217;s fat, and scant of breath. &#8211; <br />
 Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:<br />
 The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Good madam!</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Gertrude, do not drink.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong> <em>[Aside.]</em><br />
 It is the poison&#8217;d cup; it is too late.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 My lord, I&#8217;ll hit him now.</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 I do not think&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong> <em>[Aside.]</em><br />
 And yet &#8217;tis almost &#8216;gainst my conscience.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;<br />
 I pray you pass with your best violence:<br />
 I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Say you so? come on.</p>
<p><em>[They play.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Nothing, neither way.</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Have at you now!</p>
<p><em>[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they<br />
 change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 Part them; they are incens&#8217;d.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Nay, come again!</p>
<p><em>[The Queen falls.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Look to the queen there, ho!</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 They bleed on both sides. &#8211; How is it, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 How is&#8217;t, Laertes?</p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;<br />
 I am justly kill&#8217;d with mine own treachery.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 How does the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 She swoons to see them bleed.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong><br />
 No, no! the drink, the drink! &#8211; O my dear Hamlet! &#8211; <br />
 The drink, the drink! &#8211; I am poison&#8217;d.</p>
<p><em>[Dies.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 O villany! &#8211; Ho! let the door be lock&#8217;d:<br />
 Treachery! seek it out.</p>
<p><em>[Laertes falls.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br />
 No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br />
 In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br />
 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br />
 Unbated and envenom&#8217;d: the foul practice<br />
 Hath turn&#8217;d itself on me; lo, here I lie,<br />
 Never to rise again: thy mother&#8217;s poison&#8217;d:<br />
 I can no more: &#8211; the king, the king&#8217;s to blame.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 The point envenom&#8217;d too! &#8211; <br />
 Then, venom, to thy work.</p>
<p><em>[Stabs the King]</em></p>
<p><strong>Osric and Lords.</strong><br />
 Treason! treason!</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br />
 O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,<br />
 Drink off this potion. &#8211; Is thy union here?<br />
 Follow my mother.</p>
<p><em>[King dies.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong><br />
 He is justly serv&#8217;d;<br />
 It is a poison temper&#8217;d by himself. &#8211; <br />
 Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:<br />
 Mine and my father&#8217;s death come not upon thee,<br />
 Nor thine on me!</p>
<p><em>[Dies.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. &#8211; <br />
 I am dead, Horatio. &#8211; Wretched queen, adieu! &#8211; <br />
 You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br />
 That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br />
 Had I but time, &#8211; as this fell sergeant, death,<br />
 Is strict in his arrest, &#8211; O, I could tell you, &#8211; <br />
 But let it be. &#8211; Horatio, I am dead;<br />
 Thou liv&#8217;st; report me and my cause aright<br />
 To the unsatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Never believe it:<br />
 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. &#8211; <br />
 Here&#8217;s yet some liquor left.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 As thou&#8217;rt a man,<br />
 Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I&#8217;ll have&#8217;t. &#8211; <br />
 O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br />
 Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!<br />
 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br />
 Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br />
 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br />
 To tell my story. -</p>
<p><em>[March afar off, and shot within.]</em></p>
<p>What warlike noise is this?</p>
<p><strong>Osric</strong><br />
 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,<br />
 To the ambassadors of England gives<br />
 This warlike volley.</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong><br />
 O, I die, Horatio;<br />
 The potent poison quite o&#8217;er-crows my spirit:<br />
 I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br />
 But I do prophesy the election lights<br />
 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br />
 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br />
 Which have solicited. &#8211; the rest is silence.</p>
<p><em>[Dies.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Now cracks a noble heart. &#8211; Good night, sweet prince,<br />
 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br />
 Why does the drum come hither?</p>
<p><em>[March within.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Fortinbras</strong><br />
 Where is this sight?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 What is it you will see?<br />
 If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>
<p><strong>Fortinbras</strong><br />
 This quarry cries on havoc. &#8211; O proud death,<br />
 What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br />
 That thou so many princes at a shot<br />
 So bloodily hast struck?</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador</strong><br />
 The sight is dismal;<br />
 And our affairs from England come too late:<br />
 The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br />
 To tell him his commandment is fulfill&#8217;d<br />
 That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br />
 Where should we have our thanks?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Not from his mouth,<br />
 Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br />
 He never gave commandment for their death.<br />
 But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br />
 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br />
 Are here arriv&#8217;d, give order that these bodies<br />
 High on a stage be placed to the view;<br />
 And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br />
 How these things came about: so shall you hear<br />
 Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;<br />
 Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;<br />
 Of deaths put on by cunning and forc&#8217;d cause;<br />
 And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br />
 Fall&#8217;n on the inventors&#8217; heads: all this can I<br />
 Truly deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Fortinbras</strong><br />
 Let us haste to hear it,<br />
 And call the noblest to the audience.<br />
 For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br />
 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br />
 Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio</strong><br />
 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br />
 And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:<br />
 But let this same be presently perform&#8217;d,<br />
 Even while men&#8217;s minds are wild: lest more mischance<br />
 On plots and errors happen.</p>
<p><strong>Fortinbras</strong><br />
 Let four captains<br />
 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;<br />
 For he was likely, had he been put on,<br />
 To have prov&#8217;d most royally: and, for his passage,<br />
 The soldiers&#8217; music and the rites of war<br />
 Speak loudly for him. &#8211; <br />
 Take up the bodies. &#8211; Such a sight as this<br />
 Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br />
 Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p><em>[A dead march.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies;<br />
 after the which a peal of ordnance is shot off.]</em></p>
<p>
