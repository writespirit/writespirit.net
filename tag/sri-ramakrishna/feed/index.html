<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;A man began to sink a well, but having dug down to the depth of twenty cubits he could not find the least trace of the water-spring which was to feed his well. So he desisted from the work and selected another place for the purpose. There he dug deeper than before, but even then he could not find any water. So again he selected another spot and dug still deeper than before, but it was also of no avail. At last in utter disgust he gave up the task altogether. The sum total of the depths of these three wells was little short of a hundred cubits. Had he had the patience to devote even a half of the whole of this labour to his first well, without shifting the site of the well from place to place, he would surely have been successful in getting water. Such is the case with men who continually shift their positions in regard to faith. In order to meet with success we should devote ourselves entirely to a single object of faith, without being doubtful as to its efficacy.&#8221;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Q</i>. Why do you not lead a family life with your wife?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>A</i>. The God Kârtikeya, the leader of the Heavenly army, once happened to scratch a cat with his nail. On going home he saw there was the mark of a scratch on the cheek of his Mother. Seeing this, he asked of her, &#8216;Mother, dear, how have you got that ugly scratch on your cheek?&#8217; The Goddess Durgâ replied, &#8216;Child, this is thy own handiwork,&#8211;the mark scratched by thy own nail.&#8217; Kârtikeya asked in wonder, &#8216;Mother, how is it? I never remember to have scratched thee!&#8217; The Mother replied, &#8216;Darling, hast thou forgotten having scratched a cat this morning?&#8217;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Kârtikeya said, &#8216;Yes, I did scratch a cat; but how did your cheek get marked?&#8217; The Mother replied, &#8216;Dear child, nothing exists in this world but myself. I am all creation. Whomsoever thou hurtest, thou hurtest me.&#8217; Kârtikeya was greatly surprised at this, and determined thenceforward never to marry; for whom would he marry? Every woman was mother to him. I am like Kârtikeya. I consider every woman as my Divine Mother.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;A man sitting under the shade of the Kalpa-v<i>ri</i>ksha (wishing-tree) wished to be a king, and in an instant he was a king. The next moment he wished to have a charming damsel, and the damsel was instantly by his side. The man then thought within himself, if a tiger came and devoured him, and alas! in an instant he was in the jaws of a tiger! God is like that wishing-tree: whosoever in His presence thinks that he is destitute and poor, remains as such, but he who thinks and believes that the Lord fulfils all his wants, receives everything from Him.&#8221;</p>
