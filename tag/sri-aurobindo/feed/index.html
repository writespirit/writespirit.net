<p>But Savitri answered to almighty Death:<br />
&#8220;O dark-browed sophist of the universe<br />
Who veilst the Real with its own Idea,<br />
Hiding with brute objects Nature&#8217;s living face,<br />
Masking eternity with thy dance of death,<br />
Thou hast woven the ignorant mind into a screen<br />
And made of Thought error&#8217;s purveyor and scribe,<br />
And a false witness of mind&#8217;s servant sense.<br />
An aesthete of the sorrow of the world,<br />
Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy<br />
Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light<br />
And called in Truth to vindicate a lie.<br />
A lying reality is falsehood&#8217;s crown<br />
And a perverted truth her richest gem.<br />
O Death, thou speakest truth but truth that slays,<br />
I answer to thee with the Truth that saves.<br />
A traveller new-discovering himself,<br />
One made of Matter&#8217;s world his starting-point,<br />
He made of Nothingness his living-room<br />
And Night a process of the eternal light<br />
And death a spur towards immortality.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo,</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">A marvellous sun looked down from ecstasy&#8217;s skies<br />
On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection&#8217;s home,<br />
Magical unfoldings of the Eternal&#8217;s smile<br />
Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight.<br />
God&#8217;s everlasting day surrounded her,<br />
Domains appeared of sempiternal light<br />
Invading all Nature with the Absolute&#8217;s joy.<br />
Her body quivered with eternity&#8217;s touch,<br />
Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span id="more-20051"></span><br />
Infinity&#8217;s finite fronts she lived in, new<br />
For ever to an everliving sight.<br />
Eternity multiplied its vast self-look<br />
Translating its endless mightiness and joy<br />
Into delight souls playing with Time could share<br />
In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths,<br />
In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights,<br />
In passionate heart-beats of an undying love,<br />
In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade.<br />
Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes,<br />
In serene arches of translucent calm<br />
From Wonder&#8217;s dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down<br />
An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes<br />
Which suffered without pain the absolute ray<br />
And saw immortal clarities of form.<br />
Twilight and mist were exiles from that air,<br />
Night was impossible to such radiant heavens.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo</p>

<p>&#8220;To be capable of silence, stillness, illuminated passivity is to be fit for immortality <em>—amr.tatv ¯aya kalpate</em>.</p>
<p>It is to be dh¯ıra, the ideal of our ancient civilisation, which does not mean to be tamasic, inert and a block. The inaction of the tamasic man is a stumbling-block to the energies around him, the inaction of the Yogin creates, preserves and destroys; his action is dynamic with the direct, stupendous driving-power of great natural forces. It is a stillness within often covered by a ripple of talk and activity without,—the oceanwith its lively surface of waves. But even as men do not see the reality of God’s workings from the superficial noise of the world and its passing events, for they are hidden beneath that cover, so also shall they fail to understand the action of the Yogin, for he is different within from what he is outside.</p>
<p>The strength of noise and activity is, doubtless, great,—did not the walls of Jericho fall by the force of noise? But infinite is the strength of the stillness and the silence, in which great forces prepare for action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The silent Soul of all the world was there:<br />
A Being lived, a Presence and a Power,<br />
A single Person who was himself and all<br />
And cherished Nature&#8217;s sweet and dangerous throbs<br />
Transfigured into beats divine and pure.<br />
One who could love without return for love,<br />
Meeting and turning to the best the worst,<br />
It healed the bitter cruelties of earth,<br />
Transforming all experience to delight;<br />
Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth<br />
It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child<br />
And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy;<br />
It led things evil towards their secret good,<br />
It turned racked falsehood into happy truth;<br />
Its power was to reveal divinity.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo</p>
