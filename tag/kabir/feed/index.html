<p>The light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright:<br />
The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love’s detachment beats the time.<br />
Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kabîr says<br />
“My Beloved One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky.”</p>
<p>Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?<br />
Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and night,<br />
There are the hidden banner and the secret canopy:<br />
There the sound of the unseen bells is heard.<br />
Kabîr says: “There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the Universe sitteth on His throne.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-438" title="light-trees" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/light-trees.jpg" alt="light-trees" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright:<br />
The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love&#8217;s<br />
detachment beats the time.<br />
Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kabîr<br />
says:<br />
&#8220;My Beloved One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Kabir</p>
<p><span id="more-19080"></span>Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?<br />
Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and<br />
night,<br />
There are the hidden banner and the secret canopy:<br />
There the sound of the unseen bells is heard.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the<br />
Universe sitteth on His throne.&#8221;<br />
The whole world does its works and commits its errors: but few<br />
are the lovers who know the Beloved.<br />
The devout seeker is he who mingles in his heart the double<br />
currents of love and detachment, like the mingling of the<br />
streams of Ganges and Jumna;<br />
In his heart the sacred water flows day and night; and thus the<br />
round of births and deaths is brought to an end.</p>
<p>Behold what wonderful rest is in the Supreme Spirit!  and he<br />
enjoys it, who makes himself meet for it.<br />
Held by the cords of love, the swing of the Ocean of Joy sways to<br />
and fro; and a mighty sound breaks forth in song.<br />
See what a lotus blooms there without water!  and Kabîr says<br />
&#8220;My heart&#8217;s bee drinks its nectar.&#8221;<br />
What a wonderful lotus it is, that blooms at the heart of the<br />
spinning wheel of the universe!  Only a few pure souls know of<br />
its true delight.<br />
Music is all around it, and there the heart partakes of the joy<br />
of the Infinite Sea.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Dive thou into that Ocean of sweetness: thus let all<br />
errors of life and of death flee away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behold how the thirst of the five senses is quenched there!  and<br />
the three forms of misery are no more!<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;It is the sport of the Unattainable One: look<br />
within, and behold how the moon-beams of that Hidden One shine<br />
in you.&#8221;<br />
There falls the rhythmic beat of life and death:<br />
Rapture wells forth, and all space is radiant with light.<br />
There the Unstruck Music is sounded; it is the music of the love<br />
of the three worlds.<br />
There millions of lamps of sun and of moon are burning;<br />
There the drum beats, and the lover swings in play.<br />
There love-songs resound, and light rains in showers; and the<br />
worshipper is entranced in the taste of the heavenly nectar.<br />
Look upon life and death; there is no separation between them,<br />
The right hand and the left hand are one and the same.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There the wise man is speechless; for this truth may<br />
never be found in Vadas or in books.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have had my Seat on the Self-poised One,<br />
I have drunk of the Cup of the Ineffable,<br />
I have found the Key of the Mystery,<br />
I have reached the Root of Union.<br />
Travelling by no track, I have come to the Sorrowless Land: very<br />
easily has the mercy of the great Lord come upon me.<br />
They have sung of Him as infinite and unattainable: but I in my<br />
meditations have seen Him without sight.<br />
That is indeed the sorrowless land, and none know the path that<br />
leads there:<br />
Only he who is on that path has surely transcended all sorrow.<br />
Wonderful is that land of rest, to which no merit can win;<br />
It is the wise who has seen it, it is the wise who has sung of<br />
it.<br />
This is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous<br />
savour?<br />
He who has savoured it once, he knows what joy it can give.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the<br />
wise man becomes speechless and silent,<br />
The worshipper is utterly inebriated,<br />
His wisdom and his detachment are made perfect;<br />
He drinks from the cup of the inbreathings and the outbreathings<br />
of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the whole sky is filled with sound, and there that music is<br />
made without fingers and without strings;<br />
There the game of pleasure and pain does not cease.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you<br />
will find your life in the Supreme Land of Bliss.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a frenzy of ecstasy there is in every hour! and the<br />
worshipper is pressing out and drinking the essence of the<br />
hours: he lives in the life of Brahma.<br />
I speak truth, for I have accepted truth in life; I am now<br />
attached to truth, I have swept all tinsel away.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Thus is the worshipper set free from fear; thus have<br />
all errors of life and of death left him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the sky is filled with music:<br />
There it rains nectar:<br />
There the harp-strings jingle, and there the drums beat.<br />
What a secret splendour is there, in the mansion of the sky!<br />
There no mention is made of the rising and the setting of the<br />
sun;<br />
In the ocean of manifestation, which is the light of love, day<br />
and night are felt to be one.<br />
Joy for ever, no sorrow,&#8211;no struggle!<br />
There have I seen joy filled to the brim, perfection of joy;<br />
No place for error is there.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There have I witnessed the sport of One Bliss!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have known in my body the sport of the universe: I have escaped<br />
from the error of this world..<br />
The inward and the outward are become as one sky, the Infinite<br />
and the finite are united: I am drunken with the sight of this<br />
All!<br />
This Light of Thine fulfils the universe: the lamp of love that<br />
burns on the salver of knowledge.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There error cannot enter, and the conflict of life<br />
and death is felt no more.&#8221;</p>
