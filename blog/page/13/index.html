<p class="caption">Sri Ramakrishna&#8217;s Room</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</strong></p>
<p>The Gospel of Sri Ramkrishna tells of the unique life and teachings of spiritual Master, Sri Ramakrishna. <a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/sri-ramakrishna/">Sri Ramakrishna</a> who was born in a simple Indian village and received little in the way of formal education. However, from an early age he felt, with great intensity, a desire to see God. Throughout the book we are constantly reminded of the pure devotion inherent in the life and spirit of Sri Ramakrishna. Frequently we become aware of the mystical ecstasy&#8217;s Ramakrishna would repeatedly enjoy. To the credit of the author M, we feel a glimpse of this devotional consciousness; the book is far more than just dry words, describing facts and theories. Any spiritual seeker can derive great inspiration from this book. In particular it will encourage us to pursue the direct path of love, devotion and surrender.</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda a biography by Swami Nikhilananda.</strong></p>
<p>If Sri Ramakrishna was the source of mystical knowledge, Vivekandana, was his faithful disciple who strove to manifest his Master&#8217;s light. Vivekananda was not just a saint and liberated Soul, he felt the necessity of awakening his fellow man from ignorance, leading them to their own liberation. Throughout this well written biography we become aware of Vivekananda&#8217;s spiritual depth and also his desire to serve others selflessly. Through this biography the indomitable spirit of Vivekananda is clearly shown. It is not possible to read this book without being infused with some of Vivekananda&#8217;s remarkable spirit: &quot;Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.&quot;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowlska &#8211; Divine Mercy in My Soul</strong></p>
<p>The diary of saint Maria Kowalska gives a revealing insight into a contemporary Christian Saint. The depth of her devotion and obedience is both revealing and inspiring.</p>
<p>During her brief life on earth she lived as a humble nun, unknown to the outside world. The remarkable feature of her life was her inner life and connection to her spiritual guide Jesus Christ. She explains in simple and clear language the divine grace and blessings that she frequently experienced. Because she had such a deep inner connection to the source of divine consciousness, she could willingly and happily submit to the many trials, humiliations and sufferings that came her way. The power of the book makes you realise that if we can discover the divine within, there is nothing that you cannot face in the outer world. Although she died in obscurity in 1938, her writings led Pope John Paul II to hail her as &quot;the great apostle of Divine Mercy in our time.&quot;</p>

			<p>These are some of my personal favorite spiritual books. This list is far from exhaustive, but, it is just a few good suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>A Search In Secret India. by Paul Brunton</strong></p>
<p>One always retains a certain affection for the book which gives you a real thirst for the spiritual life. It was the concluding chapter in &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot; by, Paul Brunton, that awoke a real longing for me to try meditation. The book tells of the various adventures and experiences of Paul Brunton, as he travels through India.Throughout the book we are introduced to a variety of exotic fakirs, saints, astrologers and charlatans. But, it is amidst his various journey&#8217;s and travels we get a real glimpse of the ancient spirituality of India. In particular, his visit to Arunachala and the great Sage, Ramana Maharshi, really stick in the mind. It is on the holy mountain of Arunachala that Paul Brunton experiences a state of advanced meditation. Much to the credit of the writer, he is able to convey at least a glimpse of this marvelous experience. Most importantly it awakens in the aspirant the feeling that this is something we can experience ourselves.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/paul-brunton/">Paul Brunton</a></p>
<p><strong>Autobiography of a Yogi. by Paramhansa Yogananda</strong></p>
<p>For many &quot;autobiography of a yogi&quot; has opened up a whole new world of yoga, spiritual masters and Saints. Many concepts in the book are, to a westerner, far removed from our conventional education. Yet, Yogananda writes with such a potent spiritual force that great spiritual feats and experiences feel like a natural occurrence. It is hard, if not impossible, to express experiences of super-consciousness, but through Yogananda we get a memorable insight into the life and viewpoint of a real yogi. Rightly a spiritual classic, the autobiography of a yogi really captures the imagination.</p>
<p>Initiation by Elizabeth Haisch.</p>
<p>Initiation is a fascinating insight into the struggles and spiritual memories of Elizabeth Haisch. We are given a revealing insight into the spirituality of Ancient Egypt, through her memories and experiences we realise the possibilities of reincarnation and self realisation. A treasure of juicy information about reincarnation, but also a book that inspires us to live the spiritual life yourself.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/paramahansa-yogananda/autobiography-of-a-yogi/">Autobiography of a Yogi by Yogananda</a></p>
<p><strong>Savitri by Sri Aurobindo</strong></p>
<p>I have not read even 20% of Savitri, sometimes I read it and I fail to grasp its sublime meaning. Yet, despite my failure to read it in its entirety, it maintains a powerful pull. Some verses stand out, even just a few lines are quite often sufficient to take us to a realm of poetic delight. Savitri gives a unique and unprecedented understanding of profound spiritual truths. Certain chapters I have bookmarked for frequent rereading. In particular, the conversation between <a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/spiritual_poets/sri_aurobindo_poetry/savitri/my-god-is-love/">Death and Savitri</a>, to me give a quite remarkable view of spiritual evolution and the mystery of life and death. Perhaps, Savitri is far ahead of its time. But to delve into the world of Savitri is like delving into the meditation of a realised Spiritual Master.</p>
<p>Savitri by Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Within. by Sri Chinmoy</strong></p>
<p>Books on spiritual knowledge are numerous, but to read spiritual advice, whilst feeling the illumination of a real spiritual master are rare. The mark of true spiritual writing is not just the words, but the consciousness with which they embody. Through a unique, concise style, Sri Chinmoy highlights spiritual ideals with a mixture of poetry, prose and aphorism. In fact, at times the prose is like poetry. It does not so much argue as state profound truths in the manner of a real Seer. The prose comes with the confidence of one who has experienced these truths in his own life. Whilst the prose is poetic, the poetry can similarly educate like prose. There is beauty and power in the poetry, but Sri Chinmoy also uses short poetic aphorisms as a means to reinforce the meaning of prose in the minimum of words.</p>

			<p><strong>1. Humility</strong></p>
<p>A liberated soul knows that he is not the doer. He knows and feels that he is a mere instrument for the higher power. It is this awareness that enables him to be a channel for divine light. A liberated soul does not deal with his own individual will and individual freedom; he seeks only to be a channel for the Divine Will.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Because I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.&quot; &#8211; Jesus Christ [1]</p></blockquote>
<p>This humility is only possible when a person has subdued his ego. When our ego is predominant we feel that we are the doer. But, if we transcend the dominance of the ego, we learn true humility. This state of consciousness gives does not give us a sense of superiority, but oneness with others. Because of his sense of identification with others a liberated soul will never feel better than others.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;A real spiritual Master will never think that he is superior to anybody. He will feel that it is his bounden duty to be of service to the divinity, to the Supreme in humanity.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sri Chinmoy [2]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Equanimity</strong></p>
<p>A liberated soul has made a permanent connection with his inner reality, the Universal Source. He sees through the ephemeral nature of the outer world; he knows that what happens in the outer world does not affect the real in us &#8211; our soul. Thus, whatever may befall a liberated soul on the outer plane, nothing affects his inner poise and inner peace. At the same time, a liberated soul is not bound by any outer rules; some spiritual Master&#8217;s may display outer emotions for various reasons. Yet, even if they display anger outwardly, inwardly they retain a perfect inner peace. Their show of anger may merely be an outer emotion necessary for the well being of others.</p>
<p><strong>3. No Fear of Death.</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sarada Devi said that we can always tell the difference between a spiritual person and an ordinary person.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;The difference between a spiritual man and an ordinary man is very simple. Easily you can know the difference between the two. An ordinary man cries and sheds bitter tears when death approaches him; whereas a spiritual man, if he is really spiritual, he will laugh and laugh when death approaches him, for to him death is fun, nothing else&quot; [3]</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in the face of death, a liberated soul will not lose his inner peace, because he knows that death is merely an inevitable process of transition. For a liberated soul, death is like going from one room to another. The soul may lose a body, but it retains the quintessence of its life experiences in the soul&#8217;s world. Furthermore, in many ways liberation is akin to gaining mastery over death. For real illumination to occur, a seeker must lose his sense of little &quot;I&quot; ness. It is only through losing the sense of ego, that a seeker can gain liberation. When Jesus Christ said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot;&quot; [4]</p></blockquote>
<p>He meant that the sense of ego must die, to enable the divine consciousness to enter.</p>
<p><strong>4. Purity</strong></p>
<p>A liberated soul is the embodiment of his own inner realization. If we have a little receptivity, we will feel in the spiritual Master a sense of peace, purity and inner joy. Outwardly the liberated soul may be ugly. But, if we look into their eyes, we will definitely see that they have attained a consciousness far beyond the ordinary. The liberated soul may say or do nothing; but, just being in their presence may give an inexplicable and unexpected sense of inner peace and well being.</p>

<h3> &#8216;T is so Much Joy </h3>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&rsquo;T is so much joy! &rsquo;T is so much joy!<br />
   If I should fail, what poverty! <br />
   And yet, as poor as I <br />
   Have ventured all upon a throw;<br />
   Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so <br />
   This side the victory! </p>
<p>   Life is but life, and death but death! <br />
   Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath! <br />
   And if, indeed, I fail, <br />
   At least to know the worst is sweet.<br />
   Defeat means nothing but defeat, <br />
   No drearier can prevail! </p>
<p>   And if I gain,&mdash;oh, gun at sea,<br />
   Oh, bells that in the steeples be, <br />
   At first repeat it slow!<br />
   For heaven is a different thing <br />
   Conjectured, and waked sudden in,<br />
  And might o&rsquo;erwhelm me so!</p>

			<p>Philosophy and spirituality share some common ideas, but also differ in their approach and practise of the truth. To some people there is a wide divergence between philosophy and spirituality. However, to some extent, they share some similarities and both have their role to play in the discovery of truth.</p>
<p><strong>1. Mind and Heart.</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy deals primarily with the mind. It tries to understand, solve and explain problems through mental clarity and written explanation. Philosophy can seek to prove the existence of God, but this proof is always through the medium of the human intellect. In philosophy, it is the mind that is predominant.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Philosophy is in the thinking mind. Philosophy is of the searching mind. Philosophy is for the illumining mind.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>[1] &#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>Spirituality accepts the mind can have a role to play; but, at the same time it can never be satisfied solely with the reasoning of the mind. Spirituality wishes to experience the heart of reality, and not just examine life from the fringes. Spirituality is not so much concerned with proving God&#8217;s existence; spirituality teaches us to make the God a living presence in our consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Spirituality is in the aspiring heart. Spirituality is of the liberating soul. Spirituality is for the fulfilling and immortalising God.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>[1] &#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p><strong>2. Proof vs Experience.</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy seeks to prove and convince others. For example, philosophers seek to prove either the existence or non existence of God. A philosopher can enlighten others to a limited extent. But, in practise, few are converted by the philosophy of others. Even the most persuasive and convincing explanations of God&#8217;s existence leave us unsatisfied. Spirituality is not concerned with convincing others; spirituality is primarily a matter of personal experience. Spirituality is not something to be talked about, but, lived. It may be impossible to explain our spiritual experiences to others, but this does not matter. The belief or disbelief of other people does not impact on our experience. Practising spirituality can give us a genuine feeling of inner peace and connection with our source. When we develop this connection we have good feeling towards others, but, we do not feel responsible for their beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Role of Consciousness.</strong></p>
<p>The essence of spirituality is consciousness. A spiritual seeker seeks to bring to the fore his divine qualities of peace and light. These are not mere words, but, become a living presence. Philosophy can talk about these states of consciousness, but on its own it cannot bring them into the consciousness of the reader. The highest philosophy can lead a seeker along the right path; but, ultimately philosophy has limitations in moving the reader from a mental understanding to a direct experience.</p>
<p><strong>4. Complexity and Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Spirituality loves simplicity. Philosophy loves complexity. Both have their roles to play; but, it is often through simplicity that we can most easily reach the goal. Philosophy takes delight in pursuing multiple lines of inquiry. Hypotheses are tested against the strictures of logic and the most developed reasoning of the mind. Spirituality does not criticize the path of the mind, but, says to the aspiring seeker. &quot;Dive Deep within. All questions can be answered in your silent mind and aspiring heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Philosophy takes us along the path to our destination. It can remove the ignorance and prejudices of the mind. By illumining the mind it can aspire us to understand and grow into the truth. Spirituality urges us to make the truth a living reality. Spirituality and philosophy need not be at loggerheads. Spirituality informs philosophy, it gives added meaning to the illumination of the mind.</p>

<p><em>&quot;No matter which path you follow for meditation, the first and foremost task is to try to make the mind calm and quiet. &quot;</em></p>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>Beginners to meditation find that when they sit down to meditate their mind is akin to a mad monkey; no matter how hard we try, the power of the mind&#8217;s thoughts seem to make meditation most difficult. However, it is possible to have a completely clear mind. It is not easy, but there are various techniques that can be used to quieten the mind. These are some techniques that I recommend.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Source of Thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a thought appears in your mind, ask yourself &#8211; where did this thought originate from? Try to dive deep into the source of this thought. When you follow the source of your thoughts you realise that our real essence is not mental thoughts; there is something beyond thought. This is a powerful technique for calming our mind because we realise there is a separation between what we are and our thoughts. When we feel thoughts as separate from our identity it is easy to stop them completely.</p>
<p><strong>2. Will Power.</strong></p>
<p>Another technique to stop thoughts is to use the power of our will. Develop the determination to stop all thoughts completely. Feel like you are vigilantly guarding your mind. As soon as a thought appears stop it entering. If you like you can imagine throwing it out of your mind completely. The important thing is to not allow any thought, whether good or bad.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Spiritual Heart</strong></p>
<p>A most effective technique for reducing the power is to move our awareness from the mind to the heart. The mind, by nature, invites thoughts, The heart is the seat of the soul; it is in the heart where we can feel an expansive quality, not limited by the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;The mind has its own power, and right now this power is stronger than your present eagerness and determination to meditate. But if you can get help from your heart, then gradually you will be able to control your mind. The heart, in turn, gets constant assistance from the soul, which is all light and all power.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<p>The nature of the heart is to identify with a meditative consciousness. In the heart thoughts will automatically lose their power. To enter the heart we can listen to the heart beat. We can also imagine a beautiful heart garden. The important thing is to feel our whole sense of awareness leaving our mind and entering into the heart.</p>
<p><strong>4. Mantra.</strong></p>
<p>Repeating a mantra many times creates a meditative vibration. It focuses the mind in a very direct way; the mind gets used to concentrating on one particular thing at a time. When our mantra ends, our mind will be clearer and more receptive to meditation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>The real secret to a quiet mind is a genuine aspiration to realise the benefits of meditation. If we are satisfied with what we have and what we are, we will not feel the necessity of diving deep within. However, if we feel the necessity of discovering our inner reality, we will have the motivation and enthusiasm for persevering with our meditation. This is important, because, when our aspiration is intense it brings down a grace from above; it is this grace which makes a silent mind much easier to achieve.</p>

			<p>Film Review: Proces de Jeanne D&#8217;Arc by Tejvan</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;they do not order me to disobey the Church, but God must be served first.&#8221; &#8211; Joan d&#8217;Arc at her trial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/Joan-of-Arc1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-19971" style="margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;" title="Joan-of-Arc" alt="Joan-of-Arc" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/Joan-of-Arc1-660x519.jpg" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Directed by Robert Bresson the trial of Joan of Arc is a fascinating perspective of the show trial of, Joanne d&#8217;Arc, the patron saint of France. The striking feature of the film is its simplicity. There is nothing staged for dramatic or emotional effect. Bresson adds nothing to complicate or distract from the essence of this extraordinary trial. Bresson leaves it to the power of the words and the austere setting to create a thought provoking and very realistic account of this fascinating trial. The simplicity and power of the film comes from Robert Bresson&#8217;s decision to remain as faithful as possible to the exact transcript of the trial. By good fortune, all of Jeanne&#8217;s questions and answers were written down. From these extracts, and her later rehabilitation trial 25 years after her death, Bresson is able to deliver a realistic and compelling insight into the final moments and inner thoughts of Jeanne d&#8217;Arc. As with many of his other films, Robert Bresson chose not to use professional actors. He believed that real actors often hide behind their stage personae. When watching a great actor, he feels that, sometimes we struggle to separate the actor from the character. Bresson felt by using non professional actors it would help them to get at the heart of the character, unencumbered by previous roles. In this film, Florence Delay, who provides a performance of great dignity and intensity, played the lead character of Jeanne D&#8217;arc. Florence manages to capture Jeanne&#8217;s quixotic mix of gentleness, spirituality and, on occasions, a forceful insolence to the questioning of her interrogators. The performance gives a revealing insight into the intrepid, and resolute character of Jeanne. Yet despite her bravery and courage, the trial was obviously a severely testing time; she has no counsel or sympathisers. The simple black and white shots of her room, chains and interrogators give an unsentimental portrayal of her darkest hours. For example, in one scene, we see a brick thrown through her window. In a sense of desperation Jeanne replies: &#8220;Where are my people? Why have they deserted me?&#8221;</p>
<p>(Jeanne was betrayed by King Charles II, who she helped gain the throne. He never attempted to rescue her. ) Throughout the film we get a glimpse into the life of a Saint, but with the very real human qualities of fear and desperation; it is a powerful combination. The drama of the film comes from the intense battle of wits between Bishop Cauchon and Jeanne d&#8217;arc. Jeanne speaks on her mystical experiences with neither hesitation nor fear. It expresses a remarkable confidence and sincerity. &#8220;I believed it at once, and I had the will to believe it. When Saint Michael came to me, he said to me: &#8216;Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret will come to thee; follow their counsel; they have been chosen to guide thee and counsel thee in all that you have to do: believe what they shall tell thee, it is the order of Our Lord.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>At other times we see her sincere pride in her leadership and mission: &#8220;Which did you care for most, your banner or your sword?&#8221; (interrogators) &#8220;Better, forty times better, my banner than my sword!&#8221; (Jeanne d&#8217;Arc)</p>
<p>We see Jeanne portrayed not as a romanticised Saint, but as a real person, aware of a very specific mission, but on the other hand aware she also displays a genuine humility. &#8220;I do not know if it be the Will of God. Without the grace of God I should not know how to do anything.&#8221; (Jeanne)</p>
<p>It is also worth briefly mentioning the role of Bishop Chaucon whom Jeanne D&#8217;Arc refers to as my chief enemy) In previous films, he is portrayed in a very unflattering light; this film shows him in a more sympathetic light. Whilst not excusing his actions, we do get to understand his mindset which lead him to such a course of action. It seems Bishop Chaucon sincerely felt he had a divine duty to save the immortal Soul of Jeanne d&#8217;Arc. Throughout the film the powerful academics and church hierarchy endeavour to make Jeanne d&#8217;Arc submit to the will of the Church. Many times they ask her, &#8220;Will you submit to the authority of the Church.?</p>
<p>The answer of Joan, which sticks vividly in the memory. &#8220;they do not order me to disobey the Church, but God must be served first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under intense pressure, by the stake, after weeks of solitude and being deprived of any material or spiritual comfort, Jeanne did retract her actions, signing a confession. But this relapse did prove temporary, and after 1 night, she retracted her previous confession and was burned at the stake. It is testament to her extraordinary capacity to inspire others that 500 years after her death, the life of Joan d&#8217;Arc has created and ever growing compilation of studies, films and novels. This film gives one of the most penetrating insights into her actual character. We feel it is a realistic portrayal of her final moments, unspoilt by the imagination of the directors and artists.</p>
