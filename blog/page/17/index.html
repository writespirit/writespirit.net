			<p>What should we pray for?</p>
<p>People pray for many different things. Pray can be a form of desire. We pray for material comforts or release from physical pain. However prayer can be more than just praying for the satisfaction of our material needs. The highest prayer is merely to become one with the highest spiritual realisation.</p>
<div class="float-left figure">
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<p>There is a story of two great Spiritual figures, <a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/sri-ramakrishna/">Sri Ramakrishna</a> and his beloved disciple Swami Vivekananda. Due to the death of his father <a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/swami-vivekananda/">Swami Vivekananda?s</a> family were living in extreme poverty; his mother started to criticise Vivekananda, saying why did he spend his time praying to God when God could not even provide for the family?s basic needs. Vivekananda felt cut to the bone, so he went to his Spiritual Master Sri Ramakrishna and explained his family?s dire financial predicaments. Sri Ramakrishna compassionately replied to Vivekananda and said if he went to the Temple of Mother Kali and prayed for the boon of financial wealth all his family?s financial problems would be solved.</p>
<p>Encouraged by his master?s promise Vivekananda went to the temple of Mother Kali to pray for money. However Vivekananda was a seeker of the highest order. His inner nature yearned for God. When he entered the temple of the Mother, Vivekananda became absorbed in the spiritual vibrations of the Temple. He felt his consciousness soar as he became enamoured of the bliss of the Mother. In such an exalted spiritual state Vivekananda forgot his desire for financial freedom. His only prayer was</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;O Mother, please give me Jnana (wisdom) and Bhakti (devotion).&quot;  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>After praying and meditating Vivekananda returned to his Master and told him he had forgotten to pray for money in the Presence of Kali. Ramakrishna smiled and advised him to go back into the temple but this time to pray for money. Vivekananda returned but again he became so absorbed in his meditation that he could not bring himself to ask for money. 3 Times Ramakrishna sent Vivekananda into the temple to pray but each time Vivekananda couldn?t bring himself to pray for money. Eventually Ramakrishna compassionately said he would pray on his disciple?s behalf. He would pray that his family would always have enough to pay for the basic essentials of life. After this his family?s dire financial hardship was removed, although they never experience material prosperity.</p>
<p>Vivekananda was a great seeker, who eventually became a spiritual Master in his own right. This story is illustrative of how the human mind often doesn?t know the best thing to pray for. On many occasions we feel that if our desires for more money and wealth can be fulfilled, all our problems will be solved. However no matter how much money we may have we will never attain lasting satisfaction. Real happiness comes from our oneness with God. When we attain oneness with God everything else seems unimportant</p>
<p>The highest prayer uttered by Jesus Christ was</p>
<p><em>?not my will but thine be done?</em> &quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2" name="id2">[2]</a> Through this prayer Christ surrendered his personal will to the will of God. Christ knew that our human prayers might not be in our best interest, the greatest prayer is merely to become with God.</p>
<p>Later Sri Ramakrishna offered Vivekananda all his occult powers. Ramakrishna even tempted Vivekananda by saying he would be able to use these powers to help others. Vivekananda only replies will this help me realise God. Ramakrishna replied it wouldn?t and so Vivekananda turned down the opportunity to gain occult powers. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3" name="id3">[3]</a></p>

			<p>Born to wealthy parents in the Italian town of Assisi the young Francesco enjoyed all the privileges of a prosperous upbringing. Franscesco was bright and intelligent; helping his father in business he proved to be an able and capable man. He was also a soldier who took part in the crusades of the time.</p>
<p>However the material prosperity and worldly success lost all attraction for St Francis. After coming back from war he became seriously ill and felt the futility of seeking happiness through the accumulation of material wealth and social prestige. Francesco instead felt an intense yearning to live the life of a simple disciple of Christ. Following a literal interpretation of the Gospel St Francis sought to take vows of poverty and chastity.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Announce the kingdom! Possess no gold or silver or copper in your purses, no travelling bag, no sandals, no staff&quot; (see Luke 9:1-3)&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst stumbling upon the ruins of a broken chapel in Assisi, he felt the voice of Christ ask him to rebuild the derelict chapel.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Francis, go out and build up my house, for it is nearly falling down.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the beginning he worked alone to rebuild the chapel, but over time his purity of spirit and single-minded devotion attracted other like minded young men from the city. This was to be the nucleus of a new religious order.</p>
<p>Initially the relative success of St Francis in reaching out to the poor attracted only the jealousy and apprehension of the established Church authorities. Partly due to this St Francis set off for the Vatican to seek an audience with the Pope. Against the majesty of the Vatican, St Francis and his disciples cut a sharp contrast. Arriving tired and dishevelled in their simple cloaks, many felt the ideals of poverty and renunciation went against the established church orthodoxy. However the Pope saw in Francesco a genuine spirituality. He blessed the mission of St Francis, laying the foundations for the Francesco order.</p>
<p>After receiving the blessings of the Catholic Church St Francis and his disciples had much greater freedom to practise and teach the ideals of the gospels. The monks would often wander barefooted living a simple spiritual lifestyle of prayer, meditation and singing. They were noted for their happiness and gaiety even in the face of material adversity.</p>
<p>St Francis was noted for his sense of identity with animals. He felt a oneness with all of God&#8217;s creatures and in return animals are said to have felt great trust in St Francis. It is said wild birds would often land on his palm. To Francis birds were symbolic of the human spirit stripped of all pretensions and desires. For St Francis the way to God was not through scholarly learning but through developing a sense of oneness with God. He taught that real happiness comes when you become free of worldly attachments and desires. When a seeker can learn to live in harmony with God, the beauty and simplicity of life would bring abiding happiness.</p>

<h3><a name="two-films-on-st-francis-of-assisi">Two films on St Francis of Assisi</a></h3>
<p>St Francis of Assisi &#8211; God&#8217;s Jester. This film used real Franciscan monks. It captures the innocence and spirituality of St Francis and his disciples. An unconventional approach which captured the essence of St Francis&#8217;s lifestyle.</p>
<p>Brother Sun, Father Moon. St Francis is portrayed effectively as a genuinely humble saint (if a bit dopey with a prediliction for taking off his clothes. The film is not without its quirks there is a somewhat &quot;new age&quot; feeling to the film; at times his relationship with the St Clare of Assisi seems to be more romantic than spiritual. Great scene in the Vatican between St Francis and the Pope (played by Alec Guinness) though.</p>

			<p>The love of one&#8217;s country is a splendid thing.  But why should love stop at the border? </p>
<p>  ~ Pablo Casals
</p>
<p>&rdquo;Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism &#8211; how passionately I hate them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>  ~Albert Einstein
</p>
<p>&quot;To him in whom love dwells, the whole world is but one family. &quot;  </p>
<p>~<a href="http://www.writespirit.net/religious-traditions/buddhism/life-of-buddha/"> Buddha</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our hearts where they rocked our cradle,<br />
  Our love where we spent our toil,<br />
  And our faith, and our hope, and our honor,<br />
  We pledge to our native soil.<br />
  God gave all men all earth to love,<br />
  But since our hearts are small,<br />
  Ordained for each one spot should prove<br />
  Beloved over all.</p>
<p>~Rudyard Kipling
<p>&rdquo;Do not&#8230; regard the critics as questionable patriots.  What were Washington and Jefferson and Adams but profound critics of the colonial status quo? &ldquo; </p>
<p>  ~Adlai Stevenson</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, which course is patriotic and which isn&#8217;t.  You cannot shirk this and be a man.  To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and excusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may.</p>
<p>  ~Mark Twain
</p>
<p>Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it.</p>
<p> ~ George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Nationalism is an infantile disease.  It is the measles of mankind.&quot; </p>
<p>~Albert Einstein, The World As I See It, 1934
</p>
<p>If I knew something that would serve my country but would harm mankind, I would never reveal it; for I am a citizen of humanity first and by necessity, and a citizen of France second, and only by accident. </p>
<p> ~Montesquieu 
</p>
<p>I am not an Athenian or a Greek, I am a citizen of the world.  </p>
<p>~ Socrates
</p>
<p>The stench of the trail of Ego in our History.  It is ego &#8211; ego, the fountain cry, origin, sole source of war. </p>
<p>~ George Meredith, Beauchamp&#8217;s Career</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our country is the world, our countrymen are all mankind.  We love the land of our nativity, only as we love all other lands.  The interests, rights, and liberties of American citizens are no more dear to us than are those of the whole human race.  Hence we can allow no appeal to patriotism, to revenge any national insult or injury. </p>
<p>~William Lloyd Garrison, Declaration of Sentiments, Boston Peace Conference, 1838 
</p>
<p>If our country is worth dying for in time of war let us resolve that it is truly worth living for in time of peace. </p>
<p>~Hamilton Fish
</p>
<p>Patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg from which wars are hatched.</p>
<p> ~Guy de Maupassant

<p>It is lamentable, that to be a good patriot one must become the enemy of the rest of mankind.  </p>
<p>~Voltaire, Philosophical Dictionary

<p>~Baha&#8217;u&#8217;llah
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Patriotism is undivine only if there is no real sincere feeling behind patriotism, if in the name of patriotism you just go and condemn or strike other nations and try to lord it over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-	<a href="http://www.writespirit.net/sri-chinmoy/">Sri Chinmoy</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;To destroy a country we need power. This power is undivine, unillumined and ill-founded. To love a country we need a great power. This great power is our pure and constant concern for our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nationalism, especially when it urges us to fight for freedom, is noble and life-giving. But often it becomes a narrow creed, and limits and encompasses its votaries and makes them forget the many-sidedness of life. But Rabindranath Tagore has given to our nationalism the outlook of internationalism and has enriched it with art and music and the magic of his words, so that it has become the full-blooded emblem of India&#8217;s awakened spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. Nehru

<p><strong>&quot;Heaven on Earth: Shaker Aesthetic Philosophy&quot;</strong> by Sumangali Morhall</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hands to work and hearts to God&quot;</em> so the Shaker work ethic went. The term &#8216;Shaker&#8217; is best known as a style of furniture, but how did it evolve? Where did the Shakers come from, and why did they start to disappear after 100 years?</p>
<p>In modern Europe and America, craftspeople are still reviving not just the Shaker style, but in some cases the Shaker dedication to integrity. A form of aesthetic Chinese Whispers has inevitably crept in over the years, and one may now even buy such anomalies as Shaker jewellery boxes. The simple and beautiful style can arguably be applied to anything, but the philosophy behind the style makes it all the more interesting as an art form.</p>
<p>The first Shakers came from Manchester, England, in the late 18th Century. They began as a small group of Quakers, but developed their own doctrines, based largely on a strong sense of community and self-sufficiency. Community tasks were clearly defined and rotated so that anyone could be replaced on any job if unable to work on a particular day. The day started early and ended late, and was punctuated by regular prayer sessions.</p>
<div class="float-left figure">
<div class="image"><img alt="shaker" src="http://www.writespirit.net/blog/images/shaker.jpg" /></div>
<p class="caption">Shaker Hat</p>
</div>
<p>Purity?inner and outer?was a cornerstone of Shaker life. They led celibate lives, men and women living in separate quarters, entering buildings through separate doors, and sitting in separate areas of communal buildings. They created an almost completely egalitarian society, where work, respect and authority were divided fairly between men and women. This led to an interesting approach to beauty. Their way of dress was modest and simple so as not to attract attention from the opposite sex. They wore no adornment or pattern (certainly no jewellery), and although they stopped short of uniforms as such, their clothing was almost devoid of individuality.</p>
<p>So beauty was not sought in human form. Even objects, although fastidiously designed for human use, were not visually based on human features. Clock faces are no longer faces when they house maintenance knobs. Their bodies are no longer bodies when their shoulders and waist are replaced by straight lines. Symmetry itself though was seen as human narcissism, if asymmetry made for a more practical object.</p>
<p>Shaker perfection was in the ultimate usability of the object, but also in the process of its creation. &quot;Do your work as though you had a thousand years to live and as if you were to die tomorrow&quot; so they used to say. Work was an intrinsic part of their spiritual lives, thus its integrity was part of its appeal.</p>
<p>And they knew it had appeal. Commercial value was important to the Shakers&#8217; survival. They did a roaring trade in such lines as vegetable seeds, fabric and leather, as well as furniture. The circular saw, the flat broom and the clothes peg are all Shaker inventions. The Shaker name became a household brand, synonymous with quality.</p>
<p>&quot;Trifles make perfection, but perfection is no trifle.&quot; On the face of it this Shaker maxim seems to contradict itself, or hint at an underlying frivolity, but in fact it reveals a deeper understanding of their motivations. As The New Yorker&#8217;s Adam Gopnik observes in &quot;The Shining Tree of Life&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;The urge to make consumer goods is, after all, one of the keenest spiritual disciplines that an ascetic can face: it forces spirit to take form. An ascetic drinking tea from a cup decides not to care what kind of cup he&#8217;s drinking from; an ascetic forced to make a cup has to ask what kind of cup he ought to drink from.&quot;</p>
<p>Their dedication to perfection and to work was not only of benefit to themselves and their customers, but unfortunately left them open to abuse. However, as their practicality reached all aspects of life, the Shakers took it all in their stride. The homeless would sometimes come to them in winter, apparently wishing to convert to their branch of Christianity, only to leave in the spring with full bellies and warm clothes. The same would return and be accepted again the following year. Bountiful vegetable patches would fall prey to thieves. The Shaker solution? To plant extra so the thieves may eat well too.</p>
<p>The demise of the Shaker community came not from such abuse, but largely from the rise in mass production. The market for homespun fabrics, hand-picked vegetables and passionately hand-crafted wood diminished, and with it the Shaker population. The Shaker style&#8217;s popularity has survived though, and perhaps some still hold dear the Shaker spiritual work ethic, which can really be applied to anything (including jewellery boxes).</p>

<p>Sufism is the mystical branch of Islam. It has its roots in the Qu&rsquo;ran  and the Islamic tradition, but at the same times encompasses the  universal mysticism that we see in other spiritual traditions</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties of describing their experiences,  the words of the Sufi Seers still tease, cajole and inspire us to look  beyond the page and into our own hearts. For those who love words, it  is necessary to have poetry, which can take us beyond the domain of the  intellect. Hafiz beautifully describes the purpose of a poet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A poet is someone who can pour light into a cup, then raise it to nourish your beautiful parched, holy heart</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Secrets of Happiness by Jogyata Dallas</strong></p>
<p>The quest for lasting happiness lies at the very heart of all human purpose and experience, though this much desired attainment is sought in many different ways. Among the ways that have proven successful a number of recurring themes are evident.</p>
<p>The perennial philosophies of our spiritual teachers urge self-perfecting, the inner way, while most of mankind is searching in the outer world ? right person, right possessions, right place.</p>
<div class="line-block"></div>
<p>Here are a few pointers that work:</p>
<div class="line-block"></div>
<p><strong>Start Within</strong></p>
<p>A huge wealth of highly credible literature and teachings concur that happiness is first of all an inner accomplishment, not just a series of circumstances. Prayer, contemplation, quiet time, simply sitting with peaceful music, the practice of inner stillness, all help in developing understanding, balance, an inner harmony and poise. Happiness arises out of these practices like the fragrance of a flower.</p>
<p><strong>Visualise Your Day</strong></p>
<p>Take five minutes at the start of each day to visualize what you intend to accomplish ? prepare the mind, your life energy, and burst into your day with vigour, intensity, calm resolve and joy. Every day we create our world with our mind ? our moods, emotions, attitudes and consciousness. Train the mind and fill it with inspiration and positive energies, self-faith, the bright colours of your heart and soul.</p>
<p><strong>Be Healthy</strong></p>
<p>Try to achieve excellent and enduring physical health through regular cardiovascular exercise and reasonable diet. The well-being of the body creates the foundations of a lasting happiness. Body, mind, heart, soul interconnect and impact on each other ? happiness is helped by physical well-being as well as by stress free living, simplicity, spiritual awakening. The body is the temple, the soul is the shrine, happiness the fragrance.</p>
<p><strong>Compassion and Kindness</strong></p>
<p>Practice kindness and acts of self-giving. When we use our good qualities to serve others, our good qualities multiply. When we neglect these and live only for ourselves, they wither. This is karma yoga, spirituality in action ? the ego is erased, the heart widens, our oneness with others expands and deepens. Happiness blossoms when we see and serve the divinity in everything around us.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>
<p>Try not to feel burdened by life or see yourself as frail and vulnerable. See every trial and challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, triumph, and see yourself as having much undiscovered strength and capacity. Feel gratitude for your life ? for what you have and what you do not have, who you are and who you are not. Feel your life perfection and your own blossoming perfection. You are the soul and your talents and capacities are boundless ? it?s really true.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity is the shedding of everything that prevents our enlightenment. Our world dazzles us with endless enchantments ? we will be happy if we have more, if we acquire this, that. But simplicity brings a happiness that comes through having less, achieving desirelessness. For desires do not diminish through fulfillment but deepen and multiply. The more we get, the more we want. Simplicity is an inner achievement ? ?simplicity is an advanced course? as <a class="reference" href="http://www.writespirit.net/sri-chinmoy/">Sri Chinmoy</a> succinctly says.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Desire is a cord that binds us to the world ? simplicity severs the cord and brings detachment and freedom. According to the spiritual masters, the ultimate simplicity is the surrender of one?s self-determination to God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Heart Not Mind</strong></p>
<p>The mind plays a dominant role in our modern life and slowly fills up with the ambitions, ideas, hopes and expectations that eventually shape our lives. We superimpose upon the flowing stream of our life all the limiting impositions and plans of the mind, but often at the expense of our happiness. Learn to ?feel? your life?s direction rather than plan and change it; listen to the wisdom of the spiritual heart, not the cautious deliberations of the mind; and ?see? your way forward with intuition and instinct rather than create it with the mind?s limited intent. ?Living in the heart?, a gift earned through spiritual practice and simplicity, recognises our life?s deeper purpose and gives us the courage to follow this. The heart knows how to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Have a Sense of Humour</strong></p>
<p>Although our strong sense of ?I? and ?me? makes each of us the epicentre of our universe, six billion other ?I?s? and ?mes? are also out there at the centre of their universe, all playing the leading role in their own private drama-comedy. A sense of humour gives us a light touch and reminds us that, like characters in a play, our role will be over very soon, the curtain will fall and we?ll go back to the changing room (the soul?s world) to prepare for another part. Like Groundhog Day, we wake up every day of our life (and every life in our many incarnations) and confront the same personal reality and unresolved issues until we at last get it right ? and what ?getting it right? really means is something you have to discover for yourself. Smiling about all this both unburdens us and gives us inner calm ? helpful benefits in the torrid battlefield of life.</p>
<p><strong>Try Meditation</strong></p>
<p>I?m serious. One day, probably too late, you?ll wake up and realise that your lifelong pursuit of material things and nest building isn?t really working ? you?ve had some fun, done pretty well, but you?re feeling unfulfilled and a bit empty inside. That?s because this isn?t really what it?s all about and real happiness, permanent happiness, is instead about personal enlightenment, freedom from suffering and egotism, discarding the ignorance that hides our true nature. So life will keep hitting you hard until you realise this ultimately liberating truth. Meditation will awaken this inner knowledge, reconnect you with your essential spiritual nature, show you a ?way out? of the discontent of your life. If you are ready and sincerely willing to try, your inner progress will be your life?s true accomplishment and finally the measure of it?s real worth.</p>
<p>Test these guidelines in your own life &#8211; see for yourself if they work. But make a start, for as the Latin proverb goes &#8211; Aut tunc, aut nunquam &#8211; it was then or never?.</p>

<h2>What Happens</h2>
<p >What happens when your soul<br />
     Begins to awaken<br />
     Your eyes<br />
     And your heart<br />
     And the cells of your body<br />
     To the great Journey of Love?</p>
<p align="center">First there is wonderful laughter<br />
     And probably precious tears</p>
<p align="center">And a hundred sweet promises<br />
     And those heroic vows<br />
     No one can ever keep.</p>
<p align="center">But still God is delighted and amused<br />
     You once tried to be a saint.</p>
<p align="center">What happens when your soul<br />
     Begins to awake in this world</p>
<p align="center">To our deep need to love<br />
     And serve the Friend?</p>
<p align="center">O the Beloved<br />
     Will send you <br />
     One of His wonderful, wild companions &ndash;</p>
<p >Like Hafiz.</p>

<h3> We are the Flute </h3>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >We are the flute, our music is all                   Thine;<br />
We are the mountains echoing only Thee;<br />
And movest to defeat or victory;<br />
Lions emblazoned high on flags unfurled-<br />
They wind invisible sweeps us through the world.</p>

<h3 align="center">Spring</h3>
<p align="center">by William Blake</p>
<p align="center">
   Sound the Flute! Now it&#8217;s mute.<br />
   Birds delight Day and Night; <br />
   Nightingale In the dale, <br />
   Lark in Sky, <br />
   Merrily, Merrily, Merrily, to welcome in the Year. </p>
<p align="center">Little Boy, Full of joy; <br />
   Little Girl, Sweet and small; <br />
   Cock does crow, So do you; <br />
   Merry voice, Infant noise, <br />
   Merrily, Merrily, to welcome in the Year.</p>
<p align="center">Little Lamb, Here I am; <br />
   Come and lick My white neck; <br />
   Let me pull Your soft Wool; <br />
   Let me kiss Your soft face: <br />
   Merrily, Merrily, we welcome in the Year.</p>
