<p>  March 4, 1801</p>
<p>  Friends and Fellow Citizens:- </p>
<p>  CALLED upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our  country, I avail myself to the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens  which is here assembled, to express my grateful thanks for the favor with  which they have been pleased to look toward me, to declare a sincere consciousness  that the task is above my talents, and that I approach it with those anxious  and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness  of my powers so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful  land, traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry,  engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing  rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye-when I contemplate these  transcendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness and the hopes of this  beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink  from the contemplation, and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking.  Utterly indeed, should I despair, did not the presence of many whom I here  see remind me, that in the other high authorities provided by our constitution,  I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal. on which to rely  under all difficulties. To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the  sovereign functions of legislation, and to those associated with you, I look  with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer  with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amid the conflicting  elements of a troubled world. </p>
<p>  During the contest of opinion through which we have passed, the animation  of discussion and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose  on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think;  but this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced according  to the rules of the constitution, all will, of course, arrange themselves  under the will of the law, and unite in common efforts for the common good.  All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of  the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must  be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal  laws must protect, and to violate which would be oppression. Let us, then,  fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social  intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life  itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that having banished from  our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and  suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance  as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.  During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, during the agonizing  spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaughter his long-lost  liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach  even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be more felt and feared  by some and less by others; that this should divide opinions as to measures  of safety. But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.  </p>
<p>  We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are  all republicans-we are federalists. If there be any among us who would wish  to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed  as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where  reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that Some honest men fear  that a republican government cannot be strong; that this government is not  strong enough. But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful  experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm,  on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government, the world&#8217;s best  hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not I believe  this, on the contrary, the strongest government on earth. I believe It is  the only one where every man, at the call of the laws, would fly to the Standard  of the law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal  concern. Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government  of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of Others? Or have  we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this  question. </p>
<p>  Let us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own federal and republican  principles, our attachment to our union and representative government. Kindly  separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one  quarter of the globe; too high-minded to endure the degradations of the others;  possessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the  hundredth and thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal  right to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our industry,  to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens, resulting not from birth  but from our actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion,  professed, indeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all of them including  honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of man; acknowledging  and adoring an overruling Providence, which by all its dispensations proves  that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter;  with all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and prosperous  people? Still one thing more, fellow citizens- a wise and frugal government,  which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them  otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement,  and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This  is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle  of our felicities. </p>
<p>  About to enter, fellow citizens, on the exercise of duties which comprehend  everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper that you should understand  what I deem the essential principles of our government, and consequently  those which ought to shape its administration. I will compass them within  the narrowest compass they will bear, stating the general principle, but  not all its limitations. Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever  state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and honest  friendship, with all nations-entangling alliances with none; the support  of the state governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations  for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against anti-republican  tendencies; the preservation of the general government in its whole Constitutional  vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous  care of the right of election by the people-a mild and safe Corrective of  abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies  are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority- the  vital principle of republics, from which there is no appeal but to force,  the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a well-disciplined  militia-our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of War, till  regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over the military authority;  economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burdened; the honest  payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement  of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of information  and the arraignment of all abuses at the bar of public reason; freedom of  religion; freedom of the press; freedom of person under the protection of  the habeas corpus; and trial by juries impartially selected-these principles  form the bright constellation which has gone before us, and guided our steps  through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and  the blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should  be the creed of our political faith- the text of civil instruction-the touchstone  by which to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from  them in moments of error or alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and  to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety. </p>
<p>  I repair, then, fellow citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With experience  enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this, the  greatest of all, I have learned to expect that it will rarely fall to the  lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and  the favor which bring him into it. Without pretensions to that high confidence  reposed in our first and great revolutionary character, whose preeminent  services had entitled him to the first place in his country&#8217;s love, and destined  for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history, I ask so much  confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration  of your affairs. I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment. When  right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command  a view of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which  will never be intentional; and your support against the errors of others,  who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts. The approbation  implied by your suffrage is a consolation to me for the past; and my future  solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed  it in advance, to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in  my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all. </p>
<p>  Relying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with obedience  to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much  better choice it is in your power to make. And may that Infinite Power which  rules the destinies of the universe, lead our councils to what is best, and  give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity. </p>
