<div class="plain">   <br />  Thomas Jefferson<br />  Eighth State of Nation, Washington, DC, 1808-11-08             <br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />    <br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>  To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: </p>
<p>  It would have been a source, fellow citizens, of much gratification if our  last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent  nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our  commerce, had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their  unrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce this salutary  effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension,  in whole or in part, of the several embargo laws. Our ministers at London  and Paris were instructed to explain to the respective Governmentsthere our  disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the  pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded and open the way  for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all  sides had been reluctantly obstructed. </p>
<p>  As each of those Governments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing  a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of  neutrals only, and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation  for an asserted acquiescence in the aggression of the other, it was reasonably  expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the  sincerity of their professions, and for restoring to the commerce of the  United States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to our ministers with  respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with a reference  to their different circumstances, and to the condition annexed by law to  the Executive power of suspension, requiring a decree of security to our  commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decrees of France. Instead  of a pledge, therefore, of a suspension of the embargo as to her in case  of such a repeal, it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found  in other considerations, and particularly in the change produced by a compliance  with our just demands by one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the  relations between the other and the United States. </p>
<p>  To Great Britain, whose power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed  not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her rescinding  her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be opened with  her, and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees  also. From France no answer has been received, nor any indication that the  requisite change in her decrees is contemplated. The favorable reception  of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted, as her orders  of council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence  on the part of the United States no longer to be pretended, but as the arrangement  proposed, whilst it resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved, moreover,  substantially the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British  orders. The arrangement has nevertheless been rejected. </p>
<p>  This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other event  having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the Executive was  authorized, it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it.  We have the satisfaction, however, to reflect that in return for the privations  imposed by the measure, and which our fellow citizens in general have borne  with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our mariners  and our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording time for prosecuting  the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion. It has  demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and firmness which govern  our councils, and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of  the laws and the rights of their country, and has thus long frustrated those  usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted, involved war; if submitted  to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence. </p>
<p>  Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance of laws  which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the ocean with danger,  it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best adapted  to such a state of things; and bringing with them, as they do, from every  part of the Union the sentiments of our constituents, my confidence is strengthened  that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring regard to the essential  rights and interests of the nation, weigh and compare the painful alternatives  out of which a choice is to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues  which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens  if I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen, whatever  it may be, will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which  the crisis ought to inspire. </p>
<p>  The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign  edicts against our commerce, with the instructions given to our ministers  at London and Paris, are now laid before you. </p>
<p>  The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture  in which the close of the discussions relating to the attack by a British  ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the nation  had manifested so honorable a sensibility. Every view of what had passed  authorized a believe that immediate steps would be taken by the British Government  for redressing a wrong which the more it was investigated appeared the more  clearly to require what had not been provided for in the special mission.  It is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose. On the contrary,  it will be seen in the documents laid before you that the inadmissible preliminary  which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to, and, moreover, that  it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of  the orders in council. The instructions which had been given to our minister  at London with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the reparation claimed  by the United States are included in the documents communicated. </p>
<p>  Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material  changes since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain which  had been alternately suspended and resumed necessarily experience a pause  under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguishes her internal  situation. </p>
<p>  With the Barbary Powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an  unjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of Algiers toward our consul to that  Regency. Its character and circumstances are now laid before you, and will  enable you to decide how far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any  measures not within the limits of the Executive authority. </p>
<p>  With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained.  Some instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken place,  but in no wise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mississippi  the Ioways, the Sacs and the Alabamas have delivered up for trial and punishment  individuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the United  States. On this side of the Mississippi the Creeks are exerting themselves  to arrest offenders of the same kind, and the Choctaws have manifested their  readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations  committed by disorderly persons of their tribe. And, generally, from a conviction  that we consider them as a part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity  their rights and interests, the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining  strength daily &#8211; is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and will  amply requite us for the justice and friendship practiced toward them. Husbandry  and household manufacture are advancing among them more rapidly with the  Southern than Northern tribes, from circumstances of soil and climate, and  one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee Nation have now under consideration  to solicit the citizenship of the United States, and to be identified with  us in laws and government in such progressive manner as we shall think best.  </p>
<p>  In consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for  the security of our sea port towns and harbors, such works of defense have  been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places,  their relative importance, and the scale of expense indicated by the amount  of the appropriation. These works will chiefly be finished in the course  of the present season, except at New York and New Orleans, where most was  to be done; and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has  been expended on the former place, yet some further views will be submitted  to Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise.  A view of what has been done at the several places, and of what is proposed  to be done, shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.  </p>
<p>  Of the gun boats authorized by the act of December last, it has been thought  necessary to build only 103 in the present year. These, with those before  possessed, are sufficient for the harbors and waters most exposed, and the  residents will require little time for their construction when it shall be  deemed necessary. </p>
<p>  Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force  so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying  on the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced others have  been added. We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory,  although such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present  you a statement of the numbers engaged. </p>
<p>  I have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call  for any general detachments of militia or of volunteers under the laws passed  for that purpose. For the ensuing season, however, they will be required  to be in readiness should their service be wanted. Some small and special  detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion  of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion, but  these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits.  By the aid of these and of the armed vessels called into service in other  quarters the spirit of disobedience and abuse, which manifested itself early  and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it, has been considerably  repressed. </p>
<p>  Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live, our  attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. For  a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized and armed  militia is their best security. It is therefore incumbent on us at every  meeting to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves if it  is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed  to invasion. Some of the States have paid a laudable attention to this object,  but every degree of neglect is to be found among others. Congress alone having  the power to produce an uniform state of preparation in this great organ  of defense, the interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their  country&#8217;s security will present this as among the most important objects  of their deliberation. </p>
<p>  Under the acts of March 11 and April 23 respecting arms, the difficulty of  procuring them from abroad during the present situation and dispositions  of Europe induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal  supply. The public factories have therefore been enlarged, additional machineries  erected, and, in proportion as artificers can be found or formed, their effect,  already more than doubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly  increase of the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter have  been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts  have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount of  the first year&#8217;s appropriation. </p>
<p>  The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of the  belligerent powers and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens  are subjects of just concern. The situation into which we have thus been  forced has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to  internal manufactures and improvements. The extent of this conversion is  daily increasing, and little doubt remains that the establishments formed  and forming will, under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence,  the freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of protecting duties and  prohibitions, become permanent. The commerce with the Indians, too, within  our own boundaries is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal  source, and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization, undisturbed  by practices hostile to both. </p>
<p>  The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending the  30th of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement will hereafter  be transmitted from the Treasury. In the mean time it is ascertained that  the receipts have amounted to near $18M, which, with the $8.5M in the Treasury  at the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after meeting the current  demands and interest incurred, to pay $2.3M of the principal of our funded  debt, and left us in the Treasury on that day near $14M. Of these, $5.35M  will be necessary to pay what will be due on the 1st day of January next,  which will complete the reimbursement of the 8% stock. These payments, with  those made in the 6.5 years preceding, will have extinguished $33.58M of  the principal of the funded debt, being the whole which could be paid or  purchased within the limits of the law and of our contracts, and the amount  of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about $2M  of interest and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus. </p>
<p>  The probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be  applied to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and safety  of our commerce shall be restored merits the consideration of Congress. Shall  it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the revenue be reduced? Or  shall it not rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads, canals,  rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity and union under  the powers which Congress may already possess or such amendment to the Constitution  as may be approved by the States? While uncertain of the course of things,  the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary  for a system of improvement, should that be thought best. </p>
<p>  Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing  the two Houses of the Legislature at their meeting, I can not omit the expression  of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested  to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration  and the many indulgences experienced at their hands. These same grateful  acknowledgements are due to my fellow citizens generally, whose support has  been my great encouragement under all embarrassments. In the transaction  of their business I can not have escaped error. It is incident to our imperfect  nature. But I may say with truth my errors have been of the understanding,  not of intention, and that the advancement of their rights and interests  has been the constant motive for every measure. On these considerations I  solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety to future destinies,  I trust that in their steady character, unshaken by difficulties, in their  love of liberty, obedience to law, and support of the public authorities,  I see a sure guaranty of thepermanence of our Republic; and, retiring from  the charge of their affairs, I carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion  that Heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages to come of prosperity  and happiness. </p>
