<p>&nbsp;AS WRITTEN</p>
<p>Statement by Mr. James P. Grant</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Director of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Conference on Population and Development</p>
<p>Cairo &#8211; 6 September 1994</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the conference on population in Mexico City in 1984, it has</p>
<p>become increasingly clear that development must be responsive to a new</p>
<p>paradigm. If it is to be sustainable today, development must not only</p>
<p>produce economic growth, sustainable in the environmental sense. It also</p>
<p>must be sustainable in a human sense &#8212; it must break the grip of</p>
<p>poverty on the bottom half or third of society and slow population</p>
<p>growth, while sustaining democracy, human rights, people&#8217;s participation</p>
<p>in the development process and peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conference can reap the fruits of two decades of deepening</p>
<p>understanding of population growth and its determinants by embracing the</p>
<p>&#8220;total approach&#8221; that is reflected in the draft Programme of Action.</p>
<p>This approach recognizes that the only hope we have of obtaining a world</p>
<p>population compatible with sustainable development is by combining</p>
<p>universal access to better health services, resulting in lower child and</p>
<p>maternal death rates; progress toward gender equality; universal access</p>
<p>to effective education (particularly for girls); and the universal</p>
<p>availability of family planning information and services adapted to each</p>
<p>country&#8217;s needs and values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will hasten solutions to the main problems that vex and</p>
<p>threaten humankind on the threshold of the 2l st century &#8212; the problems</p>
<p>of poverty, population, and environmental degradation that feed off of</p>
<p>one another in a downward spiral that brings instability and strife in</p>
<p>its wake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My message to you today is simply this: these actions are now</p>
<p>within our grasp. They are possible. They are achievable within a decade</p>
<p>or two. They would be politically popular in both developing and</p>
<p>developed countries. They would respond to the needs of women and</p>
<p>children, of families and communities. The synergism of simultaneous</p>
<p>action could produce results beyond the expectations of most by the</p>
<p>years 2000, 2015 and 2050. This is the historic challenge of the last</p>
<p>phase of the 20th century success would lay the foundation for more</p>
<p>balanced development in the 2l st century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these improvements in the human condition would cry out</p>
<p>to be achieved even if there were no such thing as a population</p>
<p>challenge.. But it is population&nbsp; growth that is now transforming</p>
<p>social development goals of this kind from being timeless&nbsp; issues of</p>
<p>primary concern to the poor into a race against time in which all&nbsp; have</p>
<p>a stake. Strategies of development which involve rather than</p>
<p>marginalize the poor, which create productive and remunerative work&nbsp; for</p>
<p>the vast majority, and which meet basic human needs for&nbsp; adequate</p>
<p>nutrition, clean water, safe sanitation, primary health&nbsp; care, primary</p>
<p>education, and family planning, have become not only&nbsp; a moral minimum</p>
<p>for our civilization but a practical minimum for&nbsp; ensuring its survival.</p>
<p>Children are at the heart of Cairo deliberations</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to talk about population and development&nbsp; without</p>
<p>talking about children. A quarter million of them will&nbsp; come into the</p>
<p>world today &#8212; and a quarter million will die this&nbsp; week,</p>
<p>unceremoniously ushered into the next world by poverty and&nbsp; neglect.</p>
<p>Children &#8212; their survival, development and protection&nbsp; &#8211; are at the</p>
<p>heart of our deliberations&nbsp; here this week, no less&nbsp; than women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For UNICEF, concerned so directly with children and women, the</p>
<p>importance of this conference is clear. Birth spacing and&nbsp; responsible</p>
<p>parenthood are vital ingredients for child survival and&nbsp; development,</p>
<p>and vital also for improvements in women&#8217;s health.&nbsp; Many studies from</p>
<p>all parts of the world show that child mortality is significantly</p>
<p>reduced when there is an interval of two years or&nbsp; more between births.</p>
<p>Moreover, births that are too early or too&nbsp; late in a mother&#8217;s life,</p>
<p>certainly before 18 and after about age&nbsp; 35, are also associated with</p>
<p>increased risks and increased rates of&nbsp; child and maternal mortality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience has demonstrated the importance of child survival</p>
<p>strategies in combination with family planning, education of girls&nbsp; and</p>
<p>women, and basic health care for mothers and children. Each of&nbsp; these</p>
<p>interventions can make a contribution toward reducing under&nbsp; five</p>
<p>mortality and slowing population growth. Collectively the&nbsp; interventions</p>
<p>act powerfully and synergistically to accomplish&nbsp; these ends.</p>
<p>The child survival-population link</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A principal reason that dramatically improving the survival of</p>
<p>infants and children slows rather than accelerates population&nbsp; growth is</p>
<p>that parents gain the confidence they need to more widely&nbsp; space</p>
<p>childbirth&#8217;s and to successfully aim for a smaller completed&nbsp; family</p>
<p>size on average. Of particular importance in both areas is&nbsp; widespread</p>
<p>and effective access to family planning information and services. Such</p>
<p>interventions as female education, and maternal and child health care</p>
<p>also play crucial and synergistic roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to a quarter of all deaths of women of reproductive age in</p>
<p>developing countries are due to pregnancy-related complications. Through</p>
<p>reproductive health programmes, including Safe Motherhood efforts and,</p>
<p>more recently, the Mother-Baby Package of interventions, we can halve</p>
<p>maternal mortality and reduce neonatal and peri-natal mortality by 30-40</p>
<p>per cent by the year 2000. Where women receive proper health care &#8211;</p>
<p>particularly during pregnancy and child birth &#8212; fertility rates tend to</p>
<p>decline, births are spaced further apart, and family size becomes a more</p>
<p>conscious choice on the part of women and couples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under five mortality and fertility rates are today so closely</p>
<p>linked, and respond so powerfully to such interventions as greatly</p>
<p>broadened access to primary health care and basic education, that</p>
<p>declines in one are unlikely to take place in the absence of declines in</p>
<p>the other. This suggests that, to achieve their own goals, those who work</p>
<p>to stabilize world population early and at relatively lower levels could</p>
<p>virtually adopt as a priority the achievement of the World Summit for</p>
<p>Children goal of reducing under five deaths. Conversely, those who seek</p>
<p>the greater survival of infants and children could well seek as their</p>
<p>own priority the spacing of births and responsible parenthood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality, of course, is that neither group needs to abandon its</p>
<p>own cause. They have only to make common cause, because achievement of</p>
<p>either goal &#8212; increased child survival or slowed population growth &#8211;</p>
<p>virtually presupposes and requires accomplishment of the other.</p>
<p>Effective child survival strategies work in tandem with effective family</p>
<p>planning services to significantly weaken the links among poverty,</p>
<p>population growth and environmental deterioration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, Population Council President Margaret Catley Carlson</p>
<p>proposed, in her Paul Hoffman Lecture, that &#8220;a &#8216;child first&#8217; policy</p>
<p>should be explored as a basis for policies and programs among those</p>
<p>concerned with population.&#8221; She noted that early population activists</p>
<p>used to stress that &#8216;every child should be a wanted child&#8217;. She</p>
<p>continued:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I am not sure at the time we understood what this could actually</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mean. Armed with the information we have about the possibility of</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discrimination among children and the daily evidence on the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; streets of many large cities of the abandonment of children, it is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time that child rights, along with adults&#8217; reproductive rights,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enter into thinking about what human rights, when fully explored,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will mean to population policy. Among other things, we must</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; increase children&#8217;s claim on the emotional and economic resources</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of both their parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great potential of this conference</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This meeting holds the promise of being a most historic world</p>
<p>gathering. The several reasons include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the great breakthrough at the core of the Programme of</p>
<p>Action awaiting your endorsement is the recognition that only a holistic</p>
<p>approach to problems of population and development can succeed. If</p>
<p>effectively carried out, this approach can produce results that few</p>
<p>envisage today. For the first time, the world community is coming</p>
<p>together behind a common understanding of the inter-relationships and</p>
<p>synergisms between improved family planning information and services;</p>
<p>efforts to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality; literacy and</p>
<p>basic education; gender equality and empowerment of women throughout the</p>
<p>life cycle, starting with girls &#8212; which are the main factors</p>
<p>influencing the choices of individuals and couples regarding family</p>
<p>size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted in the Preamble, implementing the goals and objectives of</p>
<p>the present 20 year Programme of Action would address many of the</p>
<p>fundamental population, health, education and development challenges</p>
<p>facing the entire human community. What is more, it would also result in</p>
<p>world population growth during this period and beyond at levels close to</p>
<p>the United Nations low variant &#8212; that is, peaking in the year 2050 at</p>
<p>less than 8 billion and declining thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussing population in the context of sustainable development</p>
<p>also helps us to avoid some of the pitfalls that have made the debate on</p>
<p>population issues so difficult. Most importantly, the emerging Cairo</p>
<p>consensus does not &#8220;blame the victim&#8221;; that is, the population problem</p>
<p>is not reduced to blaming the poor, especially poor women, for having</p>
<p>too many children. This simplistic and quite frankly, dangerous thesis</p>
<p>gave rise to population control efforts which &#8212; however well-</p>
<p>intentioned -were widely interpreted as thinly disguised campaigns</p>
<p>against the poor and to control women&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sustainable development perspective says that population is</p>
<p>not merely an issue of numbers, but primarily one of poorly distributed</p>
<p>and wasted resources, of unsustainable production and consumption</p>
<p>patterns. Population is now being viewed both as a common problem of the</p>
<p>wasteful, overconsuming North as well as of the rapidly-growing,</p>
<p>underdeveloped South. What is needed, then, is a partnership of North</p>
<p>and South to chart a path toward population policies rooted in equitable</p>
<p>and sustainable development for all. Instead of coercion, the new</p>
<p>approach to population policy must broaden the rights, opportunities and</p>
<p>choices of women and families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this common understanding of the problem, a concerted, global</p>
<p>effort needs to be mounted without delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, by embracing the concrete goals set forth in the Programme</p>
<p>of Action, this conference can help accelerate momentum in an area where</p>
<p>unprecedented progress is already underway -improvements for children &#8211;</p>
<p>which will in turn have a major synergistic impact on slowing population</p>
<p>growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the 1990 world Summit for Children &#8212; the first-ever global</p>
<p>summit, the world&#8217;s leaders noted the important impact of reductions in</p>
<p>child mortality on fertility levels. In their Plan of Action, they</p>
<p>pointed out that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Achievement of the goals for children and women [goals</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subsequently endorsed by the Earth Summit and incorporated into</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agenda 21, I would add parenthetically] would also contribute to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowering population growth, as sustained decline in child death</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rates towards the level at which parents become confident that</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their first children will survive is, with some time lag, followed</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by even greater reduction in child births.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child survival effect is especially strong when women and</p>
<p>couples also have access to education and family planning information</p>
<p>and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recently seen a draft study presented at Harvard&#8217;s Center</p>
<p>for Population and Development and soon to be published by the</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania that attempts to quantify the</p>
<p>interrelationship of child mortality reduction and fertility change,</p>
<p>along with many of the other factors directly and indirectly influencing</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work-in-progress suggests that achievement of the child</p>
<p>mortality reduction goal of the World Summit for Children &#8212; a one third</p>
<p>reduction by the year 2000 &#8212; would contribute to a world population</p>
<p>that is even lower than the UN&#8217;s low projection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I emphasize this not to single out child mortality reduction as</p>
<p>the principal driving force for slowing population growth &#8212; we know</p>
<p>this is not the case &#8212; but simply to stress its importance alongside</p>
<p>the other major factors and conditions that converge and inter-act to</p>
<p>enable individuals and couples to choose to have smaller families. No</p>
<p>population in the developing world has experienced a sustained fertility</p>
<p>reduction without first having gone through a major decline in infant</p>
<p>and child mortality.</p>
<p>Progress for the world&#8217;s children</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen great progress in preventing child deaths over the</p>
<p>past three decades. When I came to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund in</p>
<p>1980, 15 million children were dying every year of largely preventable</p>
<p>causes; today, with births more than 15 per cent greater, the</p>
<p>figure has been brought down below 13 million. With our vastly greater</p>
<p>capacity to reach all children with the fruits of modern science and</p>
<p>medicine, we now have a good shot at cutting 1990 levels by another 2</p>
<p>million annually by the end of next year if a series of mid-decade goals</p>
<p>already agreed to by the developing countries in the follow-up to the</p>
<p>World Summit for Children are met by December 1995. This will give us</p>
<p>momentum to achieve the year 2000 goals that will cut further millions</p>
<p>from this obscene and unnecessary death toll. National Programmes of</p>
<p>Action to meet these goals have been issued or drafted by some 120</p>
<p>countries to date and now cover about 90 percent of the world&#8217;s</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good start has been made, as reflected in achievement of the</p>
<p>1990 goal of immunizing fully 80 per cent of all the world&#8217;s children</p>
<p>against the six main killer diseases of childhood. It is also now clear</p>
<p>that a majority of developing countries are already on track to achieve</p>
<p>a majority of the 13 mid-decade goals; with a concerted international</p>
<p>effort over the next 16 months, both of these majorities could be</p>
<p>increased significantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuing today&#8217;s low-cost opportunities to protect the health,</p>
<p>nutrition, and education of women and children in the developing world</p>
<p>is one of the most immediately available and affordable ways of</p>
<p>weakening the grip of poverty, population growth, and environmental</p>
<p>deterioration, which are among the greatest threats facing humankind on</p>
<p>the threshold of the 21st century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, we are confident that this conference will</p>
<p>unbracket the language contained in Chapter VIII of the Programme of</p>
<p>Action, action point 8.16, which reaffirms the World Summit goals for</p>
<p>infant and child mortality reduction and calls for further progress</p>
<p>beyond the year 2000. Failure to remove the brackets on this section</p>
<p>would set the dangerous precedent of diminishing the commitments made by</p>
<p>the heads of state and governments of 155 countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, this conference&#8217;s recognition of the centrality of women is</p>
<p>absolutely crucial, paving the way toward the World Social summit in</p>
<p>Copenhagen and the Beijing conference on women next year &#8212; and,</p>
<p>hopefully, toward major changes in the lives of women everywhere. The</p>
<p>draft Programme of Action in its entirety captures the simple,</p>
<p>incontrovertible truth that there will be no sustainable development, no</p>
<p>stabilization of populations at manageable levels, no lasting solution</p>
<p>to the problems of environment, no true democracy, and no peace, just so</p>
<p>long as half of humanity continues to be subject to gross discrimination</p>
<p>and abuse. We are also particularly gratified that the Programme of</p>
<p>Action recognizes that gender-based discrimination against women can</p>
<p>best be overcome by constructive action throughout the life cycle. Such</p>
<p>action must begin with the girl child, where the foundations will be</p>
<p>laid for equality and empowerment later on in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women have clearly taken the lead in the struggle for an end to</p>
<p>gender discrimination. But speaking as a man and as the father of three</p>
<p>sons, I can say that we males have our work cut out for us; we have a</p>
<p>great deal of learning to do, and a great deal of changing to do, if</p>
<p>gender equality is ever to be achieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In your deliberations on the Programme of Action, I urge you to</p>
<p>build on the text of the World Summit for Children Declaration and Plan</p>
<p>of Action, which sets the goal of ensuring &#8220;access&#8230; to information and</p>
<p>services to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced,</p>
<p>too late or too many&#8221; &#8212; and let me say in this connection that when we</p>
<p>speak of family planning, we are not talking about abortion, which</p>
<p>should not be a method of family planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Summit Plan of Action also set the goal of empowering</p>
<p>&#8220;all women to breastfeed their children exclusively for four to six</p>
<p>months.&#8221; It is worth emphasizing that in addition to all its many</p>
<p>extraordinary benefits to children, women and families, breastfeeding</p>
<p>has played and still plays a major supporting role in slowing population</p>
<p>growth, especially in the poorer countries. How many of us are aware</p>
<p>that if there were no breastfeeding tomorrow, births would increase by</p>
<p>an estimated 20 30 per cent? The Institute for Reproductive Health at</p>
<p>Georgetown University estimates that breastfeeding averts between 70 and</p>
<p>90 million births a year. Families, institutions and society at large</p>
<p>must provide women who are mothers with the support and encouragement</p>
<p>they need to breastfeed and thus have healthier children, more space</p>
<p>between births, and greater personal health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say a word about the importance of youth in the context of</p>
<p>population and development. Investing in the health and development of</p>
<p>young people, particularly adolescents, is one of the most important</p>
<p>actions we can take today. Teens need support, guidance and respect if</p>
<p>they are to safely navigate the difficult transition from childhood to</p>
<p>adulthood and establish healthy behaviours that will stay with them for</p>
<p>the rest of their lives. To do this, we must understand their realities</p>
<p>and listen to their concerns; youth need to be well-informed and</p>
<p>actively involved in all efforts to promote their health and</p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, for too many girls around the world, with</p>
<p>adolescence comes motherhood, and an overnight leap into adulthood. This</p>
<p>is a cause for concern because young girls are not emotionally or</p>
<p>physically ready for childbearing. Teenage pregnancies both within and</p>
<p>outside marriage diminish young women&#8217;s opportunities and increase their</p>
<p>vulnerability to disease, maternal morbidity and mortality and poverty.</p>
<p>As outlined in the Programme of Action, basic education, especially for</p>
<p>girls, is critical to preventing a cycle of early pregnancy and</p>
<p>impoverishment. This, along with access to appropriate information and</p>
<p>services, and the development of &#8220;life-skills&#8221;, will help young people</p>
<p>make informed decisions to prevent early parenthood and to enhance the</p>
<p>quality of their lives as they grow into the adults of the 2l st</p>
<p>century. And recent studies have shown that delays of just a few years</p>
<p>in marriage and childbearing could significantly contribute to slowing</p>
<p>population growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, we must see to it that women are empowered to control</p>
<p>their lives and their fertility, through education, jobs and access to</p>
<p>health care, including family planning information and services. We must</p>
<p>place special emphasis on informing, supporting and facilitating the</p>
<p>participation of young people in their quest to live healthy and</p>
<p>productive lives. And we must help men become responsible and</p>
<p>participatory parents.</p>
<p>The 20/20 joint initiative</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fourth and final point refers to the vital question of</p>
<p>resources. The modest funds required to implement the strategies and</p>
<p>meet the goals established in the Programme of Action must be made</p>
<p>available quickly and without conditionalities. There are indications</p>
<p>that, with this conference, greater funding may be forthcoming for</p>
<p>mainly one aspect of the action plan that is before us. As welcome as</p>
<p>any sectoral increases obviously are, it is important to keep in mind</p>
<p>the essential breakthrough taking place at this conference: recognition</p>
<p>that any solution to population and development problems will require a</p>
<p>holistic approach. And holistic funding, too &#8212; which ideally, given the</p>
<p>urgency of the inter-related threats facing one and all in the global</p>
<p>village, should involve significant increases in resource availability</p>
<p>for meeting the most critical goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without for a moment renouncing our quest for increases toward</p>
<p>meeting the long established goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of</p>
<p>industrial countries&#8217; GDP to official development assistance (ODA) &#8212; a</p>
<p>goal inspired both by justice and prudence &#8212; I commend to your</p>
<p>attention the 20/20 initiative being promoted jointly by the United</p>
<p>Nations Development Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, and</p>
<p>UNICEF. It is alluded to on two occasions in the draft Programme of</p>
<p>Action that is before you &#8212; both of them in brackets. It is precisely</p>
<p>the kind of holistic approach urgently needed for reallocating current</p>
<p>levels of funding in order to jump-start implementation of the Programme</p>
<p>of Action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, what is involves is ensuring that national governments</p>
<p>devote at least 20 per cent of their domestic budgets to providing basic</p>
<p>social services &#8212; primary health care including family planning, basic</p>
<p>education, nutrition, and low cost water and sanitation for rural and</p>
<p>peri-urban areas &#8212; and that donor countries see to it that at least a</p>
<p>similar proportion of their ODA goes to support these strategic areas</p>
<p>for sustainable human development. On average, current funding is much</p>
<p>less a share of national budgets and of ODA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From UNICEF&#8217;s vantage-point of efforts for children in over 120</p>
<p>developing countries, we see significant progress in the 20/20 direction</p>
<p>mostly on the developing country side. The donor community &#8212; which has</p>
<p>done so much to alert the world to the severity of the interlocking</p>
<p>problems that confront us &#8212; must do its part if these inescapable</p>
<p>problems are to be tackled in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this conference is followed by serious action to increase and</p>
<p>wisely reallocate resources for population and development in the</p>
<p>holistic manner I described, we will truly be tapping the potential of</p>
<p>the post-Cold War era for international cooperation.</p>
<p>A crisis point in history/an opportunity for concerted action</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before closing, permit me to quote from the Joint Statement on</p>
<p>World Population issued last year by 56 of the world&#8217;s Scientific</p>
<p>Academies:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;History is approaching a crisis point with respect to the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interlocking issues of population, environment, and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists today have the opportunity and responsibility to mount</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a concerted effort to confront our human predicament. But science</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and technology can only provide tools and blueprints for action</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and social change. It is the governments and international</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision-makers, including those meeting in Cairo &#8230; who hold the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key to our future. We urge them to take incisive action now and to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adopt an integrated policy on population and sustainable</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development on a global scale. With each year&#8217;s delay the problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become more acute. Let 1994 be remembered as the year when the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people of the world decided to Act together for the benefit of</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I would like to emphasize the &#8220;act together&#8221;. We must not</p>
<p>allow well-publicized disagreements to obscure or undermine the</p>
<p>unprecedented consensus that has consolidated around the bulk of the</p>
<p>Programme of Action. The extraordinary breadth of agreement that now</p>
<p>exists on most of the fundamentals of population and development is what</p>
<p>must be preserved and enhanced here this week &#8212; and especially in the</p>
<p>weeks, months and years of concerted global action ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our children and grandchildren &#8212; and unborn generations to come -</p>
<p>- are depending on us here in Cairo to make the wise decisions that will</p>
<p>determine their future. The choice is in our hands.</p>
