<p>A quivering trepidant uncertain world <br />
  Born from that dolorous meeting and eclipse <br />
  Appeared in the emptiness where her feet had trod, <br />
  A quick obscurity, a seeking stir. <br />
  There was a writhing of half-conscious force <br />
  Hardly awakened from the Inconscient&#8217;s sleep, <br />
  Tied to an instinct-driven Ignorance, <br />
  To find itself and find its hold on things. <br />
  Inheritor of poverty and loss, <br />
  Assailed by memories that fled when seized, <br />
  Haunted by a forgotten uplifting hope, <br />
  It strove with a blindness as of groping hands <br />
  To fill the aching and disastrous gap <br />
  Between earth-pain and the bliss from which Life fell. <br />
  A world that ever seeks for something missed, <br />
  Hunts for the joy that earth has failed to keep. <br />
  Too near to our gates its unappeased unrest <br />
  For peace to live on the inert solid globe: <br />
  It has joined its hunger to the hunger of earth, <br />
  It has given the law of craving to our lives, <br />
  It has made our spirit&#8217;s need a fathomless gulf. <br />
  An Influence entered mortal night and day, <br />
  A shadow overcast the time-born race; <br />
  In the troubled stream where leaps a blind heart-pulse <br />
  And the nerve-beat of feeling wakes in sense <br />
  Dividing Matter&#8217;s sleep from conscious Mind, <br />
  There strayed a call that knew not why it came. <br />
  A Power beyond earth&#8217;s scope has touched the earth; <br />
  The repose that might have been can be no more; <br />
  A formless yearning passions in man&#8217;s heart, <br />
  A cry is in his blood for happier things:</p>

<p>Else could he roam on a free sunlit soil <br />
  With the childlike pain-forgetting mind of beasts <br />
  Or live happy, unmoved, like flowers and trees. <br />
  The Might that came upon the earth to bless, <br />
  Has stayed on earth to suffer and aspire. <br />
  The infant laugh that rang through time is hushed: <br />
  Man&#8217;s natural joy of life is overcast <br />
  And sorrow is his nurse of destiny. <br />
  The animal&#8217;s thoughtless joy is left behind, <br />
  Care and reflection burden his daily walk; <br />
  He has risen to greatness and to discontent, <br />
  He is awake to the Invisible. <br />
  Insatiate seeker, he has all to learn: <br />
  He has exhausted now life&#8217;s surface acts, <br />
  His being&#8217;s hidden realms remain to explore. <br />
  He becomes a mind, he becomes a spirit and self; <br />
  In his fragile tenement he grows Nature&#8217;s lord. <br />
  In him Matter wakes from its long obscure trance, <br />
  In him earth feels the Godhead drawing near. <br />
  An eyeless Power that sees no more its aim, <br />
  A restless hungry energy of Will, <br />
  Life cast her seed in the body&#8217;s indolent mould; <br />
  It woke from happy torpor a blind Force <br />
  Compelling it to sense and seek and feel. <br />
  In the enormous labour of the Void <br />
  Perturbing with her dreams the vast routine <br />
  And dead roll of a slumbering universe <br />
  The mighty prisoner struggled for release. <br />
  Alive with her yearning woke the inert cell, <br />
  In the heart she kindled a fire of passion and need, <br />
  Amid the deep calm of inanimate things <br />
  Arose her great voice of toil and prayer and strife. <br />
  A groping consciousness in a voiceless world, <br />
  A guideless sense was given her for her road; <br />
  Thought was withheld and nothing now she knew, <br />
  But all the unknown was hers to feel and clasp.</p>

<p>Obeying the push of unborn things towards birth <br />
  Out of her seal of insentient life she broke: <br />
  In her substance of unthinking mute soul-strength <br />
  That cannot utter what its depths divine, <br />
  Awoke a blind necessity to know. <br />
  The chain that bound her she made her instrument; <br />
  Instinct was hers, the chrysalis of Truth, <br />
  And effort and growth and striving nescience. <br />
  Inflicting on the body desire and hope, <br />
  Imposing on inconscience consciousness, <br />
  She brought into Matter&#8217;s dull tenacity <br />
  Her anguished claim to her lost sovereign right, <br />
  Her tireless search, her vexed uneasy heart, <br />
  Her wandering unsure steps, her cry for change. <br />
  Adorer of a joy without a name, <br />
  In her obscure cathedral of delight <br />
  To dim dwarf gods she offers secret rites. <br />
  But vain unending is the sacrifice, <br />
  The priest an ignorant mage who only makes <br />
  Futile mutations in the altar&#8217;s plan <br />
  And casts blind hopes into a powerless flame. <br />
  A burden of transient gains weighs down her steps <br />
  And hardly under that load can she advance; <br />
  But the hours cry to her, she travels on <br />
  Passing from thought to thought, from want to want; <br />
  Her greatest progress is a deepened need. <br />
  Matter dissatisfies, she turns to Mind; <br />
  She conquers earth, her field, then claims the heavens. <br />
  Insensible, breaking the work she has done <br />
  The stumbling ages over her labour pass, <br />
  But still no great transforming light came down <br />
  And no revealing rapture touched her fall. <br />
  Only a glimmer sometimes splits mind&#8217;s sky <br />
  Justifying the ambiguous providence <br />
  That makes of night a path to unknown dawns <br />
  Or a dark clue to some diviner state.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">In Nescience began her mighty task, <br />
  In Ignorance she pursues the unfinished work, <br />
  For knowledge gropes, but meets not Wisdom&#8217;s face. <br />
  Ascending slowly with unconscious steps, <br />
  A foundling of the Gods she wanders here <br />
  Like a child-soul left near the gates of Hell <br />
  Fumbling through fog in search of Paradise. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this slow ascension he must follow her pace <br />
  Even from her faint and dim subconscious start: <br />
  So only can earth&#8217;s last salvation come. <br />
  For so only could he know the obscure cause <br />
  Of all that holds us back and baffles God <br />
  In the jail-delivery of the imprisoned soul. <br />
  Along swift paths of fall through dangerous gates <br />
  He chanced into a grey obscurity <br />
  Teeming with instincts from the mindless gulfs <br />
  That pushed to wear a form and win a place. <br />
  Life here was intimate with Death and Night <br />
  And ate Death&#8217;s food that she might breathe awhile; <br />
  She was their inmate and adopted waif. <br />
  Accepting subconscience, in dumb darkness&#8217; reign <br />
  A sojourner, she hoped not any more. <br />
  There far away from Truth and luminous thought <br />
  He saw the original seat, the separate birth <br />
  Of the dethroned, deformed and suffering Power. <br />
  An unhappy face of falsity made true, <br />
  A contradiction of our divine birth, <br />
  Indifferent to beauty and to light, <br />
  Parading she flaunted her animal disgrace <br />
  Unhelped by camouflage, brutal and bare, <br />
  An authentic image recognised and signed <br />
  Of her outcast force exiled from heaven and hope, <br />
  Fallen, glorying in the vileness of her state, <br />
  The grovel of a strength once half divine, <br />
  The graceless squalor of her beast desires,</p>

  The naked body of her poverty. <br />
  Here first she crawled out from her cabin of mud <br />
  Where she had lain inconscient, rigid, mute: <br />
  Its narrowness and torpor held her still, <br />
  A darkness clung to her uneffaced by Light. <br />
  There neared no touch redeeming from above: <br />
  The upward look was alien to her sight, <br />
  Forgotten the fearless godhead of her walk; <br />
  Renounced was the glory and felicity, <br />
  The adventure in the dangerous fields of Time: <br />
  Hardly she availed, wallowing, to bear and live. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A wide unquiet mist of seeking Space, <br />
  A rayless region swallowed in vague swathes, <br />
  That seemed, unnamed, unbodied and unhoused, <br />
  A swaddled visionless and formless mind, <br />
  Asked for a body to translate its soul. <br />
  Its prayer denied, it fumbled after thought. <br />
  As yet not powered to think, hardly to live, <br />
  It opened into a weird and pigmy world <br />
  Where this unhappy magic had its source. <br />
  On dim confines where Life and Matter meet <br />
  He wandered among things half-seen, half-guessed, <br />
  Pursued by ungrasped beginnings and lost ends. <br />
  There life was born but died before it could live. <br />
  There was no solid ground, no constant drift; <br />
  Only some flame of mindless Will had power. <br />
  Himself was dim to himself, half-felt, obscure, <br />
  As if in a struggle of the Void to be. <br />
  In strange domains where all was living sense <br />
  But mastering thought was not nor cause nor rule, <br />
  Only a crude child-heart cried for toys of bliss, <br />
  Mind flickered, a disordered infant glow, <br />
  And random shapeless energies drove towards form <br />
  And took each wisp-fire for a guiding sun.</p>

  Asking for light she followed darkness&#8217; clue. <br />
  An inconscient Power groped towards consciousness, <br />
  Matter smitten by Matter glimmered to sense, <br />
  Blind contacts, slow reactions beat out sparks <br />
  Of instinct from a cloaked subliminal bed, <br />
  Sensations crowded, dumb substitutes for thought, <br />
  Perception answered Nature&#8217;s wakening blows <br />
  But still was a mechanical response, <br />
  A jerk, a leap, a start in Nature&#8217;s dream, <br />
  And rude unchastened impulses jostling ran <br />
  Heedless of every motion but their own <br />
  And, darkling, clashed with darker than themselves, <br />
  Free in a world of settled anarchy. <br />
  The need to exist, the instinct to survive <br />
  Engrossed the tense precarious moment&#8217;s will <br />
  And an unseeing desire felt out for food. <br />
  The gusts of Nature were the only law, <br />
  Force wrestled with force, but no result remained: <br />
  Only were achieved a nescient grasp and drive <br />
  And feelings and instincts knowing not their source, <br />
  Sense-pleasures and sense-pangs soon caught, soon lost, <br />
  And the brute motion of unthinking lives. <br />
  It was a vain unnecessary world <br />
  Whose will to be brought poor and sad results <br />
  And meaningless suffering and a grey unease. <br />
  Nothing seemed worth the labour to become. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But judged not so his spirit&#8217;s wakened eye. <br />
  As shines a solitary witness star <br />
  That burns apart, Light&#8217;s lonely sentinel, <br />
  In the drift and teeming of a mindless Night, <br />
  A single thinker in an aimless world <br />
  Awaiting some tremendous dawn of God, <br />
  He saw the purpose in the works of Time. <br />
  Even in that aimlessness a work was done</p>

  And traced its acts to a miraculous fount. <br />
  A mystic Presence none can probe nor rule, <br />
  Creator of this game of ray and shade <br />

  Asks from the body the soul&#8217;s intimacies <br />

  Impure, degraded though her motions are, <br />
  Always a heaven-truth broods in life&#8217;s deeps; <br />

  When life broke through its half-drowse in the plant <br />
  That feels and suffers but cannot move or cry, <br />
  In beast and in winged bird and thinking man <br />
  It made of the heart&#8217;s rhythm its music&#8217;s beat; <br />
  It forced the unconscious tissues to awake <br />

  And thrill with pleasure and laughter of brief delight, <br />
  And quiver with pain and crave for ecstasy. <br />
  Imperative, voiceless, ill-understood, <br />
  Too far from light, too close to being&#8217;s core, <br />
  Born strangely in Time from the eternal Bliss, <br />
  It presses on heart&#8217;s core and vibrant nerve; <br />
  Its sharp self-seeking tears our consciousness; <br />
  Our pain and pleasure have that sting for cause: <br />
  Instinct with it, but blind to its true joy <br />
  The soul&#8217;s desire leaps out towards passing things. <br />
  All Nature&#8217;s longing drive none can resist, <br />
  Comes surging through the blood and quickened sense; <br />
  An ecstasy of the infinite is her cause. <br />
  It turns in us to finite loves and lusts, <br />
  The will to conquer and have, to seize and keep,</p>

  A yearning to possess and be possessed, <br />
  To enjoy and be enjoyed, to feel, to live. <br />

  Its rapid end of momentary delight <br />
  Whose stamp of failure haunts all ignorant life. <br />

  Although on earth are firm established lives, <br />
  A working of habit or a sense of law, <br />
  A steady repetition in the flux, <br />

  A neighbour is her life to insentient Nought. <br />
  Under this law an ignorant world was made. <br />

  A Wisdom that prepares its far-off ends <br />

  Even in these formless coilings he could feel <br />

  Pursued the riddle of Godhead&#8217;s tentative pace, <br />

  Beings were born who perished without trace, <br />
  Events that were a formless drama&#8217;s limbs <br />

  A half-awakened Nescience struggled there <br />
  To know by sight and touch the outside of things. <br />
  Instinct was formed; in memory&#8217;s crowded sleep <br />
  The past lived on as in a bottomless sea: <br />
  Inverting into half-thought the quickened sense <br />
  She felt around for truth with fumbling hands,</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Clutched to her the little she could reach and seize <br />
  And put aside in her subconscient cave. <br />
  So must the dim being grow in light and force <br />
  And rise to his higher destiny at last, <br />
  Look up to God and round at the universe, <br />
  And learn by failure and progress by fall <br />
  And battle with environment and doom, <br />
  By suffering discover his deep soul <br />
  And by possession grow to his own vasts. <br />
  Half-way she stopped and found her path no more. <br />
  Still nothing was achieved but to begin, <br />
  Yet finished seemed the circle of her force. <br />
  Only she had beaten out sparks of ignorance; <br />
  Only the life could think and not the mind, <br />
  Only the sense could feel and not the soul. <br />
  Only was lit some heat of the flame of Life, <br />
  Some joy to be, some rapturous leaps of sense. <br />
  All was an impetus of half-conscious Force, <br />
  A spirit sprawling drowned in dense life-foam, <br />
  A vague self grasping at the shape of things. <br />
  Behind all moved seeking for vessels to hold <br />
  A first raw vintage of the grapes of God, <br />
  On earth&#8217;s mud a spilth of the supernal Bliss, <br />
  Intoxicating the stupefied soul and mind <br />
  A heady wine of rapture dark and crude, <br />
  Dim, uncast yet into spiritual form, <br />
  Obscure inhabitant of the world&#8217;s blind core, <br />
  An unborn godhead&#8217;s will, a mute Desire. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A third creation now revealed its face. <br />
  A mould of body&#8217;s early mind was made. <br />
  A glint of light kindled the obscure World-Force; <br />
  It dowered a driven world with the seeing Idea <br />
  And armed the act with thought&#8217;s dynamic point: <br />
  A small thinking being watched the works of Time. <br />
  A difficult evolution from below</p>

<p>Called a masked intervention from above; <br />
  Else this great, blind inconscient universe <br />
  Could never have disclosed its hidden mind, <br />
  Or even in blinkers worked in beast and man <br />
  The Intelligence that devised the cosmic scheme. <br />
  At first he saw a dim obscure mind-power <br />
  Moving concealed by Matter and dumb life. <br />
  A current thin, it streamed in life&#8217;s vast flow <br />
  Tossing and drifting under a drifting sky <br />
  Amid the surge and glimmering tremulous wash, <br />
  Released in splash of sense and feeling&#8217;s waves. <br />
  In the deep midst of an insentient world <br />
  Its huddled waves and foam of consciousness ran <br />
  Pressing and eddying through a narrow strait, <br />
  Carrying experience in its crowded pace. <br />
  It flowed emerging into upper light <br />
  From the deep pool of its subliminal birth <br />
  To reach some high existence still unknown. <br />
  There was no thinking self, aim there was none: <br />
  All was unorganised stress and seekings vague. <br />
  Only to the unstable surface rose <br />
  Sensations, stabs and edges of desire <br />
  And passion&#8217;s leaps and brief emotion&#8217;s cries, <br />
  A casual colloquy of flesh with flesh, <br />
  A murmur of heart to longing wordless heart, <br />
  Glimmerings of knowledge with no shape of thought <br />
  And jets of subconscious will or hunger&#8217;s pulls. <br />
  All was dim sparkle on a foaming top: <br />
  It whirled around a drifting shadow-self <br />
  On an inconscient flood of Force in Time. <br />
  Then came the pressure of a seeing Power <br />
  That drew all into a dancing turbid mass <br />
  Circling around a single luminous point, <br />
  Centre of reference in a conscious field, <br />
  Figure of a unitary Light within. <br />
  It lit the impulse of the half-sentient flood,</p>

<p>Even an illusion gave of fixity <br />
  As if a sea could serve as a firm soil. <br />
  That strange observing Power imposed its sight. <br />
  It forced on flux a limit and a shape, <br />
  It gave its stream a lower narrow bank, <br />
  Drew lines to snare the spirit&#8217;s formlessness. <br />
  It fashioned the life-mind of bird and beast, <br />
  The answer of the reptile and the fish, <br />
  The primitive pattern of the thoughts of man. <br />
  A finite movement of the Infinite <br />
  Came winging its way through a wide air of Time; <br />
  A march of knowledge moved in Nescience <br />
  And guarded in the form a separate soul. <br />
  Its right to be immortal it reserved, <br />
  But built a wall against the siege of death <br />
  And threw a hook to clutch eternity. <br />
  A thinking entity appeared in Space. <br />
  A little ordered world broke into view <br />
  Where being had prison-room for act and sight, <br />
  A floor to walk, a clear but scanty range. <br />
  An instrument-personality was born, <br />
  And a restricted clamped intelligence <br />
  Consented to confine in narrow bounds <br />
  Its seeking; it tied the thought to visible things, <br />
  Prohibiting the adventure of the Unseen <br />
  And the soul&#8217;s tread through unknown infinities. <br />
  A reflex reason, Nature-habit&#8217;s glass <br />
  Illumined life to know and fix its field, <br />
  Accept a dangerous ignorant brevity <br />
  And the inconclusive purpose of its walk <br />
  And profit by the hour&#8217;s precarious chance <br />
  In the allotted boundaries of its fate. <br />
  A little joy and knowledge satisfied <br />
  This little being tied into a knot <br />
  And hung on a bulge of its environment, <br />
  A little curve cut off in measureless Space,</p>

<p>A little span of life in all vast Time. <br />
  A thought was there that planned, a will that strove, <br />
  But for small aims within a narrow scope, <br />
  Wasting unmeasured toil on transient things. <br />
  It knew itself a creature of the mud; <br />
  It asked no larger law, no loftier aim; <br />
  It had no inward look, no upward gaze. <br />
  A backward scholar on logic&#8217;s rickety bench <br />
  Indoctrinated by the erring sense, <br />
  It took appearance for the face of God, <br />
  For casual lights the marching of the suns, <br />
  For heaven a starry strip of doubtful blue; <br />
  Aspects of being feigned to be the whole. <br />
  There was a voice of busy interchange, <br />
  A market-place of trivial thoughts and acts: <br />
  A life soon spent, a mind the body&#8217;s slave <br />
  Here seemed the brilliant crown of Nature&#8217;s work, <br />
  And tiny egos took the world as means <br />
  To sate awhile dwarf lusts and brief desires, <br />
  In a death-closed passage saw life&#8217;s start and end <br />
  As though a blind alley were creation&#8217;s sign, <br />
  As if for this the soul had coveted birth <br />
  In the wonderland of a self-creating world <br />
  And the opportunities of cosmic Space. <br />
  This creature passionate only to survive, <br />
  Fettered to puny thoughts with no wide range <br />
  And to the body&#8217;s needs and pangs and joys, <br />
  This fire growing by its fuel&#8217;s death, <br />
  Increased by what it seized and made its own: <br />
  It gathered and grew and gave itself to none. <br />
  Only it hoped for greatness in its den <br />
  And pleasure and victory in small fields of power <br />
  And conquest of life-room for self and kin, <br />
  An animal limited by its feeding-space. <br />
  It knew not the Immortal in its house; <br />
  It had no greater deeper cause to live.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">In limits only it was powerful; <br />
  Acute to capture truth for outward use, <br />
  Its knowledge was the body&#8217;s instrument; <br />
  Absorbed in the little works of its prison-house <br />
  It turned around the same unchanging points <br />
  In the same circle of interest and desire, <br />
  But thought itself the master of its jail. <br />
  Although for action, not for wisdom made, <br />
  Thought was its apex&#8211;or its gutter&#8217;s rim: <br />
  It saw an image of the external world <br />
  And saw its surface self, but knew no more. <br />
  Out of a slow confused embroiled self-search <br />
  Mind grew to a clarity cut out, precise, <br />
  A gleam enclosed in a stone ignorance. <br />
  In this bound thinking&#8217;s narrow leadership <br />
  Tied to the soil, inspired by common things, <br />
  Attached to a confined familiar world, <br />
  Amid the multitude of her motived plots, <br />
  Her changing actors and her million masks, <br />
  Life was a play monotonously the same. <br />
  There were no vast perspectives of the spirit, <br />
  No swift invasions of unknown delight, <br />
  No golden distances of wide release. <br />
  This petty state resembled our human days <br />
  But fixed to eternity of changeless type, <br />
  A moment&#8217;s movement doomed to last through Time. <br />
  Existence bridge-like spanned the inconscient gulfs, <br />
  A half-illumined building in a mist, <br />
  Which from a void of Form arose to sight <br />
  And jutted out into a void of Soul. <br />
  A little light in a great darkness born, <br />
  Life knew not where it went nor whence it came. <br />
  Around all floated still the nescient haze. </p>
