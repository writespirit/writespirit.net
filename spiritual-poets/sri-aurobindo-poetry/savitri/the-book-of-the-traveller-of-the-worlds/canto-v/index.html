<p>A fixed and narrow power with rigid forms, <br />
  He saw the empire of the little life, <br />
  An unhappy corner in eternity. <br />
  It lived upon the margin of the Idea <br />
  Protected by Ignorance as in a shell. <br />
  Then, hoping to learn the secret of this world <br />
  He peered across its scanty fringe of sight, <br />
  To disengage from its surface-clear obscurity <br />
  The Force that moved it and the Idea that made, <br />
  Imposing smallness on the Infinite, <br />
  The ruling spirit of its littleness, <br />
  The divine law that gave it right to be, <br />
  Its claim on Nature and its need in Time. <br />
  He plunged his gaze into the siege of mist <br />
  That held this ill-lit straitened continent <br />
  Ringed with the skies and seas of ignorance <br />
  And kept it safe from Truth and Self and Light. <br />
  As when a searchlight stabs the Night&#8217;s blind breast <br />
  And dwellings and trees and figures of men appear <br />
  As if revealed to an eye in Nothingness, <br />
  All lurking things were torn out of their veils <br />
  And held up in his vision&#8217;s sun-white blaze. <br />
  A busy restless uncouth populace <br />
  Teemed in their dusky unnoted thousands there. <br />
  In a mist of secrecy wrapping the world-scene <br />
  The little deities of Time&#8217;s nether act <br />
  Who work remote from Heaven&#8217;s controlling eye, <br />
  Plotted, unknown to the creatures whom they move, <br />
  The small conspiracies of this petty reign <br />
  Amused with the small contrivings, the brief hopes <br />
  And little eager steps and little ways</p>

<p>And reptile wallowings in the dark and dust, <br />
  And the crouch and ignominy of creeping life. <br />
  A trepidant and motley multitude, <br />
  A strange pell-mell of magic artisans, <br />
  Was seen moulding the plastic clay of life, <br />
  An elfin brood, an elemental kind. <br />
  Astonished by the unaccustomed glow, <br />
  As if immanent in the shadows started up <br />
  Imps with wry limbs and carved beast visages, <br />
  Sprite-prompters goblin-wizened or faery-small, <br />
  And genii fairer but unsouled and poor <br />
  And fallen beings, their heavenly portion lost, <br />
  And errant divinities trapped in Time&#8217;s dust. <br />
  Ignorant and dangerous wills but armed with power, <br />
  Half-animal, half-god their mood, their shape. <br />
  Out of the greyness of a dim background <br />
  Their whispers come, an inarticulate force, <br />
  Awake in mind an echoing thought or word, <br />
  To their sting of impulse the heart&#8217;s sanction draw, <br />
  And in that little Nature do their work <br />
  And fill its powers and creatures with unease. <br />
  Its seed of joy they curse with sorrow&#8217;s fruit, <br />
  Put out with error&#8217;s breath its scanty lights <br />
  And turn its surface truths to falsehood&#8217;s ends, <br />
  Its small emotions spur, its passions drive <br />
  To the abyss or through the bog and mire: <br />
  Or else with a goad of hard dry lusts they prick, <br />
  While jogs on devious ways that nowhere lead <br />
  Life&#8217;s cart finding no issue from ignorance. <br />
  To sport with good and evil is their law; <br />
  Luring to failure and meaningless success, <br />
  All models they corrupt, all measures cheat, <br />
  Make knowledge a poison, virtue a pattern dull <br />
  And lead the endless cycles of desire <br />
  Through semblances of sad or happy chance <br />
  To an inescapable fatality.</p>

<p>All by their influence is enacted there. <br />
  Nor there alone is their empire or their role: <br />
  Wherever are soulless minds and guideless lives <br />
  And in a small body self is all that counts, <br />
  Wherever love and light and largeness lack, <br />
  These crooked fashioners take up their task. <br />
  To all half-conscious worlds they extend their reign. <br />
  Here too these godlings drive our human hearts, <br />
  Our nature&#8217;s twilight is their lurking-place: <br />
  Here too the darkened primitive heart obeys <br />
  The veiled suggestions of a hidden Mind <br />
  That dogs our knowledge with misleading light <br />
  And stands between us and the Truth that saves. <br />
  It speaks to us with the voices of the Night: <br />
  Our darkened lives to greater darkness move; <br />
  Our seekings listen to calamitous hopes. <br />
  A structure of unseeing thoughts is built <br />
  And reason used by an irrational Force. <br />
  This earth is not alone our teacher and nurse; <br />
  The powers of all the worlds have entrance here. <br />
  In their own fields they follow the wheel of law <br />
  And cherish the safety of a settled type; <br />
  On earth out of their changeless orbit thrown <br />
  Their law is kept, lost their fixed form of things. <br />
  Into a creative chaos they are cast <br />
  Where all asks order but is driven by Chance; <br />
  Strangers to earth-nature, they must learn earth&#8217;s ways, <br />
  Aliens or opposites, they must unite: <br />
  They work and battle and with pain agree: <br />
  These join, those part, all parts and joins anew, <br />
  But never can we know and truly live <br />
  Till all have found their divine harmony. <br />
  Our life&#8217;s uncertain way winds circling on, <br />
  Our mind&#8217;s unquiet search asks always light, <br />
  Till they have learned their secret in their source, <br />
  In the light of the Timeless and its spaceless home,</p>

  But now the Light supreme is far away: <br />
  Our conscious life obeys the Inconscient&#8217;s laws; <br />
  To ignorant purposes and blind desires <br />
  Our hearts are moved by an ambiguous force; <br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset of this enigmatic world <br />
  Which seems at once an enormous brute machine <br />
  And a slow unmasking of the spirit in things, <br />
  In this revolving chamber without walls <br />
  In which God sits impassive everywhere <br />
  As if unknown to himself and by us unseen <br />
  In a miracle of inconscient secrecy, <br />
  Yet is all here his action and his will. <br />
  In this whirl and sprawl through infinite vacancy <br />
  The Spirit became Matter and lay in the whirl, <br />
  A body sleeping without sense or soul. <br />
  A mass phenomenon of visible shapes <br />
  Supported by the silence of the Void <br />
  Appeared in the eternal Consciousness <br />
  And seemed an outward and insensible world. <br />
  There was none there to see and none to feel; <br />
  Only the miraculous Inconscient, <br />
  A subtle wizard skilled, was at its task. <br />
  Inventing ways for magical results, <br />
  Managing creation&#8217;s marvellous device, <br />
  Marking mechanically dumb wisdom&#8217;s points, <br />
  Using the unthought inevitable Idea, <br />
  It did the works of God&#8217;s intelligence</p>

<p>Or wrought the will of some supreme Unknown. <br />
  Still consciousness was hidden in Nature&#8217;s womb, <br />
  Unfelt was the Bliss whose rapture dreamed the worlds. <br />
  Being was an inert substance driven by Force. <br />
  At first was only an etheric Space: <br />
  Its huge vibrations circled round and round <br />
  Housing some unconceived initiative: <br />
  Upheld by a supreme original Breath <br />
  Expansion and contraction&#8217;s mystic act <br />
  Created touch and friction in the void, <br />
  Into abstract emptiness brought clash and clasp: <br />
  Parent of an expanding universe <br />
  In a matrix of disintegrating force, <br />
  By spending it conserved an endless sum. <br />
  On the hearth of Space it kindled a viewless Fire <br />
  That, scattering worlds as one might scatter seeds, <br />
  Whirled out the luminous order of the stars. <br />
  An ocean of electric Energy <br />
  Formlessly formed its strange wave-particles <br />
  Constructing by their dance this solid scheme, <br />
  Its mightiness in the atom shut to rest; <br />
  Masses were forged or feigned and visible shapes; <br />
  Light flung the photon&#8217;s swift revealing spark <br />
  And showed, in the minuteness of its flash <br />
  Imaged, this cosmos of apparent things. <br />
  Thus has been made this real impossible world, <br />
  An obvious miracle or convincing show. <br />
  Or so it seems to man&#8217;s audacious mind <br />
  Who seats his thought as the arbiter of truth, <br />
  His personal vision as impersonal fact, <br />
  As witnesses of an objective world <br />
  His erring sense and his instruments&#8217; artifice. <br />
  Thus must he work life&#8217;s tangible riddle out <br />
  In a doubtful light, by error seize on Truth <br />
  And slowly part the visage and the veil. <br />
  Or else, forlorn of faith in mind and sense,</p>

<p>His knowledge a bright body of ignorance, <br />
  He sees in all things strangely fashioned here <br />
  The unwelcome jest of a deceiving Force, <br />
  A parable of Maya and her might. <br />
  This vast perpetual motion caught and held <br />
  In the mysterious and unchanging change <br />
  Of the persistent movement we call Time <br />
  And ever renewing its recurrent beat, <br />
  These mobile rounds that stereotype a flux, <br />
  These static objects in the cosmic dance <br />
  That are but Energy&#8217;s self-repeating whorls <br />
  Prolonged by the spirit of the brooding Void, <br />
  Awaited life and sense and waking Mind. <br />
  A little the Dreamer changed his pose of stone. <br />
  But when the Inconscient&#8217;s scrupulous work was done <br />
  And Chance coerced by fixed immutable laws, <br />
  A scene was set for Nature&#8217;s conscious play. <br />
  Then stirred the Spirit&#8217;s mute immobile sleep; <br />
  The Force concealed broke dumbly, slowly out. <br />
  A dream of living woke in Matter&#8217;s heart, <br />
  A will to live moved the Inconscient&#8217;s dust, <br />
  A freak of living startled vacant Time, <br />
  Ephemeral in a blank eternity, <br />
  Infinitesimal in a dead Infinite. <br />
  A subtler breath quickened dead Matter&#8217;s forms; <br />
  The world&#8217;s set rhythm changed to a conscious cry; <br />
  A serpent Power twinned the insensible Force. <br />
  Islands of living dotted lifeless Space <br />
  And germs of living formed in formless air. <br />
  A Life was born that followed Matter&#8217;s law, <br />
  Ignorant of the motives of its steps; <br />
  Ever inconstant, yet for ever the same, <br />
  It repeated the paradox that gave it birth: <br />
  Its restless and unstable stabilities <br />
  Recurred incessantly in the flow of Time <br />
  And purposeful movements in unthinking forms</p>

<p>Betrayed the heavings of an imprisoned Will. <br />
  Waking and sleep lay locked in mutual arms; <br />
  Helpless and indistinct came pleasure and pain <br />
  Trembling with the first faint thrills of a World-Soul. <br />
  A strength of life that could not cry or move, <br />
  Yet broke into beauty signing some deep delight: <br />
  An inarticulate sensibility, <br />
  Throbs of the heart of an unknowing world, <br />
  Ran through its somnolent torpor and there stirred <br />
  A vague uncertain thrill, a wandering beat, <br />
  A dim unclosing as of secret eyes. <br />
  Infant self-feeling grew and birth was born. <br />
  A godhead woke but lay with dreaming limbs; <br />
  Her house refused to open its sealed doors. <br />
  Insentient to our eyes that only see <br />
  The form, the act and not the imprisoned God, <br />
  Life hid in her pulse occult of growth and power <br />
  A consciousness with mute stifled beats of sense, <br />
  A mind suppressed that knew not yet of thought, <br />
  An inert spirit that could only be. <br />
  At first she raised no voice, no motion dared: <br />
  Charged with world-power, instinct with living force, <br />
  Only she clung with her roots to the safe earth, <br />
  Thrilled dumbly to the shocks of ray and breeze <br />
  And put out tendril fingers of desire; <br />
  The strength in her yearning for sun and light <br />
  Felt not the embrace that made her breathe and live; <br />
  Absorbed she dreamed content with beauty and hue. <br />
  At last the charmed Immensity looked forth: <br />
  Astir, vibrant, hungering, she groped for mind; <br />
  Then slowly sense quivered and thought peered out; <br />
  She forced the reluctant mould to grow aware. <br />
  The magic was chiselled of a conscious form; <br />
  Its tranced vibrations rhythmed a quick response, <br />
  And luminous stirrings prompted brain and nerve, <br />
  Awoke in Matter spirit&#8217;s identity</p>

<p>And in a body lit the miracle <br />
  Of the heart&#8217;s love and the soul&#8217;s witness gaze. <br />
  Impelled by an unseen Will there could break out <br />
  Fragments of some vast impulse to become <br />
  And vivid glimpses of a secret self, <br />
  And the doubtful seeds and force of shapes to be <br />
  Awoke from the inconscient swoon of things. <br />
  An animal creation crept and ran <br />
  And flew and called between the earth and sky, <br />
  Hunted by death but hoping still to live <br />
  And glad to breathe if only for a while. <br />
  Then man was moulded from the original brute. <br />
  A thinking mind had come to lift life&#8217;s moods, <br />
  The keen-edged tool of a Nature mixed and vague, <br />
  An intelligence half-witness, half-machine. <br />
  This seeming driver of her wheel of works <br />
  Missioned to motive and record her drift <br />
  And fix its law on her inconstant powers, <br />
  This master-spring of a delicate enginery, <br />
  Aspired to enlighten its user and refine <br />
  Lifting to a vision of the indwelling Power <br />
  The absorbed mechanic&#8217;s crude initiative: <br />
  He raised his eyes; Heaven-light mirrored a Face. <br />
  Amazed at the works wrought in her mystic sleep, <br />
  She looked upon the world that she had made: <br />
  Wondering now seized the great automaton; <br />
  She paused to understand her self and aim, <br />
  Pondering she learned to act by conscious rule, <br />
  A visioned measure guided her rhythmic steps; <br />
  Thought bordered her instincts with a frame of will <br />
  And lit with the idea her blinded urge. <br />
  On her mass of impulses, her reflex acts, <br />
  On the Inconscient&#8217;s pushed or guided drift <br />
  And mystery of unthinking accurate steps <br />
  She stuck the specious image of a self, <br />
  A living idol of disfigured spirit;</p>

  She made a thinking body from chemic cells <br />
  And moulded a being out of a driven force. <br />
  To be what she was not inflamed her hope: <br />
  She turned her dream towards some high Unknown; <br />
  A breath was felt below of One supreme. <br />
  An opening looked up to spheres above <br />
  And coloured shadows limned on mortal ground <br />
  The passing figures of immortal things; <br />
  A quick celestial flash could sometimes come: <br />
  The illumined soul-ray fell on heart and flesh <br />
  And touched with semblances of ideal light <br />
  The stuff of which our earthly dreams are made. <br />
  A fragile human love that could not last, <br />
  Ego&#8217;s moth-wings to lift the seraph soul, <br />
  Appeared, a surface glamour of brief date <br />
  Extinguished by a scanty breath of Time; <br />
  Joy that forgot mortality for a while <br />
  Came, a rare visitor who left betimes, <br />
  And made all things seem beautiful for an hour, <br />
  Hopes that soon fade to drab realities <br />
  And passions that crumble to ashes while they blaze <br />
  Kindled the common earth with their brief flame. <br />
  A creature insignificant and small <br />
  Visited, uplifted by an unknown Power, <br />
  Man laboured on his little patch of earth <br />
  For means to last, to enjoy, to suffer and die. <br />
  A spirit that perished not with the body and breath <br />
  Was there like a shadow of the Unmanifest <br />
  And stood behind the little personal form <br />
  But claimed not yet this earthly embodiment. <br />
  Assenting to Nature&#8217;s long slow-moving toil, <br />
  Watching the works of his own Ignorance, <br />
  Unknown, unfelt the mighty Witness lives <br />
  And nothing shows the Glory that is here. <br />
  A Wisdom governing the mystic world,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This huge world unintelligibly turns <br />
  In the shadow of a mused Inconscience; <br />
  It hides a key to inner meanings missed, <br />

  It studies surface laws by surface thought, <br />

  Not seeing for what she acts or why we live; <br />
  It marks her tireless care of just device, <br />

  Adds purposeful figures to her purposeless sum, <br />

  Impenetrable, a mystery recondite <br />

<p>A thrill that smites the nerves is music&#8217;s spell. <br />
  Amidst his harassed toil and welter of cares, <br />
  Pressed by the labour of his crowding thoughts, <br />
  He draws sometimes around his aching brow <br />
  Nature&#8217;s calm mighty hands to heal his life-pain. <br />
  He is saved by her silence from his rack of self; <br />
  In her tranquil beauty is his purest bliss. <br />
  A new life dawns, he looks out from vistas wide; <br />
  The Spirit&#8217;s breath moves him but soon retires: <br />
  His strength was not made to hold that puissant guest. <br />
  All dulls down to convention and routine <br />
  Or a fierce excitement brings him vivid joys: <br />
  His days are tinged with the red hue of strife <br />
  And lust&#8217;s hot glare and passion&#8217;s crimson stain; <br />
  Battle and murder are his tribal game. <br />
  Time has he none to turn his eyes within <br />
  And look for his lost self and his dead soul. <br />
  His motion on too short an axis wheels; <br />
  He cannot soar but creeps on his long road <br />
  Or if, impatient of the trudge of Time, <br />
  He would make a splendid haste on Fate&#8217;s slow road, <br />
  His heart that runs soon pants and tires and sinks; <br />
  Or he walks ever on and finds no end. <br />
  Hardly a few can climb to greater life. <br />
  All tunes to a low scale and conscious pitch. <br />
  His knowledge dwells in the house of Ignorance; <br />
  His force nears not even once the Omnipotent, <br />
  Rare are his visits of heavenly ecstasy. <br />
  The bliss which sleeps in things and tries to wake, <br />
  Breaks out in him in a small joy of life: <br />
  This scanty grace is his persistent stay; <br />
  It lightens the burden of his many ills <br />
  And reconciles him to his little world. <br />
  He is satisfied with his common average kind; <br />
  Tomorrow&#8217;s hopes and his old rounds of thought, <br />
  His old familiar interests and desires</p>

<p>He has made into a thick and narrowing hedge <br />
  Defending his small life from the Invisible; <br />
  His being&#8217;s kinship to infinity <br />
  He has shut away from him into inmost self, <br />
  Fenced off the greatnesses of hidden God. <br />
  His being was formed to play a trivial part <br />
  In a little drama on a petty stage; <br />
  In a narrow plot he has pitched his tent of life <br />
  Beneath the wide gaze of the starry Vast. <br />
  He is the crown of all that has been done: <br />
  Thus is creation&#8217;s labour justified; <br />
  This is the world&#8217;s result, Nature&#8217;s last poise! <br />
  And if this were all and nothing more were meant, <br />
  If what now seems were the whole of what must be, <br />
  If this were not a stade through which we pass <br />
  On our road from Matter to eternal Self, <br />
  To the Light that made the worlds, the Cause of things, <br />
  Well might interpret our mind&#8217;s limited view <br />
  Existence as an accident in Time, <br />
  Illusion or phenomenon or freak, <br />
  The paradox of a creative Thought <br />
  Which moves between unreal opposites, <br />
  Inanimate Force struggling to feel and know, <br />
  Matter that chanced to read itself by Mind, <br />
  Inconscience monstrously engendering soul. <br />
  At times all looks unreal and remote: <br />
  We seem to live in a fiction of our thoughts <br />
  Pieced from sensation&#8217;s fanciful traveller&#8217;s tale, <br />
  Or caught on the film of the recording brain, <br />
  A figment or circumstance in cosmic sleep. <br />
  A somnambulist walking under the moon, <br />
  An image of ego treads through an ignorant dream <br />
  Counting the moments of a spectral Time. <br />
  In a false perspective of effect and cause, <br />
  Trusting to a specious prospect of world-space, <br />
  It drifts incessantly from scene to scene,</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Whither it knows not, to what fabulous verge. <br />
  All here is dreamed or doubtfully exists, <br />
  But who the dreamer is and whence he looks <br />
  Is still unknown or only a shadowy guess. <br />
  Or the world is real but ourselves too small, <br />
  Insufficient for the mightiness of our stage. <br />
  A thin life-curve crosses the titan whirl <br />
  Of the orbit of a soulless universe, <br />
  And in the belly of the sparse rolling mass <br />
  A mind looks out from a small casual globe <br />
  And wonders what itself and all things are. <br />
  And yet to some interned subjective sight <br />
  That strangely has formed in Matter&#8217;s sightless stuff, <br />
  A pointillage minute of little self <br />
  Takes figure as world-being&#8217;s conscious base. <br />
  Such is our scene in the half-light below. <br />
  This is the sign of Matter&#8217;s infinite, <br />
  This the weird purport of the picture shown <br />
  To Science the giantess, measurer of her field, <br />
  As she pores on the record of her close survey <br />
  And mathematises her huge external world, <br />
  To Reason bound within the circle of sense, <br />
  Or in Thought&#8217;s broad impalpable Exchange <br />
  A speculator in tenuous vast ideas, <br />
  Abstractions in the void her currency <br />
  We know not with what firm values for its base. <br />
  Only religion in this bankruptcy <br />
  Presents its dubious riches to our hearts <br />
  Or signs unprovisioned cheques on the Beyond: <br />
  Our poverty shall there have its revenge. <br />
  Our spirits depart discarding a futile life <br />
  Into the blank unknown or with them take <br />
  Death&#8217;s passport into immortality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet was this only a provisional scheme, <br />
  A false appearance sketched by limiting sense,</p>

<p>Mind&#8217;s insufficient self-discovery, <br />
  An early attempt, a first experiment. <br />
  This was a toy to amuse the infant earth; <br />
  But knowledge ends not in these surface powers <br />
  That live upon a ledge in the Ignorance <br />
  And dare not look into the dangerous depths <br />
  Or to stare upward measuring the Unknown. <br />
  There is a deeper seeing from within <br />
  And, when we have left these small purlieus of mind, <br />
  A greater vision meets us on the heights <br />
  In the luminous wideness of the spirit&#8217;s gaze. <br />
  At last there wakes in us a witness Soul <br />
  That looks at truths unseen and scans the Unknown; <br />
  Then all assumes a new and marvellous face: <br />
  The world quivers with a God-light at its core, <br />
  In Time&#8217;s deep heart high purposes move and live, <br />
  Life&#8217;s borders crumble and join infinity. <br />
  This broad, confused, yet rigid scheme becomes <br />
  A magnificent imbroglio of the Gods, <br />
  A game, a work ambiguously divine. <br />
  Our seekings are short-lived experiments <br />
  Made by a wordless and inscrutable Power <br />
  Testing its issues from inconscient Night <br />
  To meet its luminous self of Truth and Bliss. <br />
  It peers at the Real through the apparent form; <br />
  It labours in our mortal mind and sense; <br />
  Amid the figures of the Ignorance, <br />
  In the symbol pictures drawn by word and thought, <br />
  It seeks the truth to which all figures point; <br />
  It looks for the source of Light with vision&#8217;s lamp; <br />
  It works to find the Doer of all works, <br />
  The unfelt Self within who is the guide, <br />
  The unknown Self above who is the goal. <br />
  All is not here a blinded Nature&#8217;s task: <br />
  A Word, a Wisdom watches us from on high, <br />
  A Witness sanctioning her will and works,</p>

<p>An Eye unseen in the unseeing vast; <br />
  There is an Influence from a Light above, <br />
  There are thoughts remote and sealed eternities; <br />
  A mystic motive drives the stars and suns. <br />
  In this passage from a deaf unknowing Force <br />
  To struggling consciousness and transient breath <br />
  A mighty Supernature waits on Time. <br />
  The world is other than we now think and see, <br />
  Our lives a deeper mystery than we have dreamed; <br />
  Our minds are starters in the race to God, <br />
  Our souls deputed selves of the Supreme. <br />
  Across the cosmic field through narrow lanes <br />
  Asking a scanty dole from Fortune&#8217;s hands <br />
  And garbed in beggar&#8217;s robes there walks the One. <br />
  Even in the theatre of these small lives <br />
  Behind the act a secret sweetness breathes, <br />
  An urge of miniature divinity. <br />
  A mystic passion from the wells of God <br />
  Flows through the guarded spaces of the soul; <br />
  A force that helps supports the suffering earth, <br />
  An unseen nearness and a hidden joy. <br />
  There are muffled throbs of laughter&#8217;s undertones, <br />
  The murmur of an occult happiness, <br />
  An exultation in the depths of sleep, <br />
  A heart of bliss within a world of pain. <br />
  An Infant nursed on Nature&#8217;s covert breast, <br />
  An Infant playing in the magic woods, <br />
  Fluting to rapture by the spirit&#8217;s streams, <br />
  Awaits the hour when we shall turn to his call. <br />
  In this investiture of fleshly life <br />
  A soul that is a spark of God survives <br />
  And sometimes it breaks through the sordid screen <br />
  And kindles a fire that makes us half-divine. <br />
  In our body&#8217;s cells there sits a hidden Power <br />
  That sees the unseen and plans eternity, <br />
  Our smallest parts have room for deepest needs;</p>

<p>There too the golden Messengers can come: <br />
  A door is cut in the mud wall of self; <br />
  Across the lowly threshold with bowed heads <br />
  Angels of ecstasy and self-giving pass, <br />
  And lodged in an inner sanctuary of dream <br />
  The makers of the image of deity live. <br />
  Pity is there and fire-winged sacrifice, <br />
  And flashes of sympathy and tenderness <br />
  Cast heaven-lights from the heart&#8217;s secluded shrine. <br />
  A work is done in the deep silences; <br />
  A glory and wonder of spiritual sense, <br />
  A laughter in beauty&#8217;s everlasting space <br />
  Transforming world-experience into joy, <br />
  Inhabit the mystery of the untouched gulfs; <br />
  Lulled by Time&#8217;s beats eternity sleeps in us. <br />
  In the sealed hermetic heart, the happy core, <br />
  Unmoved behind this outer shape of death <br />
  The eternal Entity prepares within <br />
  Its matter of divine felicity, <br />
  Its reign of heavenly phenomenon. <br />
  Even in our sceptic mind of ignorance <br />
  A foresight comes of some immense release, <br />
  Our will lifts towards it slow and shaping hands. <br />
  Each part in us desires its absolute. <br />
  Our thoughts covet the everlasting Light, <br />
  Our strength derives from an omnipotent Force, <br />
  And since from a veiled God-joy the worlds were made <br />
  And since eternal Beauty asks for form <br />
  Even here where all is made of being&#8217;s dust, <br />
  Our hearts are captured by ensnaring shapes, <br />
  Our very senses blindly seek for bliss. <br />
  Our error crucifies Reality <br />
  To force its birth and divine body here, <br />
  Compelling, incarnate in a human form <br />
  And breathing in limbs that one can touch and clasp, <br />
  Its Knowledge to rescue an ancient Ignorance,</p>

  In waves of undreamed ecstasy shall roll <br />

  It shall be caught to the breast of a white Force <br />
  And, flaming with the paradisal touch <br />
  In a rose-fire of sweet spiritual grace, <br />
  In the red passion of its infinite change, <br />
  Quiver, awake, and shudder with ecstasy. <br />
  As if reversing a deformation&#8217;s spell, <br />
  Released from the black magic of the Night, <br />
  Renouncing servitude to the dim Abyss, <br />
  It shall learn at last who lived within unseen, <br />
  And seized with marvel in the adoring heart <br />
  To the enthroned Child-Godhead kneel aware, <br />
  Trembling with beauty and delight and love. <br />
  But first the spirit&#8217;s ascent we must achieve <br />
  Out of the chasm from which our nature rose. <br />
  The soul must soar sovereign above the form <br />
  And climb to summits beyond mind&#8217;s half-sleep; <br />
  Our hearts we must inform with heavenly strength, <br />
  Surprise the animal with the occult god. <br />
  Then kindling the gold tongue of sacrifice, <br />
  Calling the powers of a bright hemisphere,</p>
