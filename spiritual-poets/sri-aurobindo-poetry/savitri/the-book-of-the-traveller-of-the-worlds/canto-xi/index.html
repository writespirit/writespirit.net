<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">There ceased the limits of the labouring Power. <br />
  But being and creation cease not there. <br />
  For Thought transcends the circles of mortal mind, <br />
  It is greater than its earthly instrument: <br />
  The godhead crammed into mind&#8217;s narrow space <br />
  Escapes on every side into some vast <br />
  That is a passage to infinity. <br />
  It moves eternal in the spirit&#8217;s field, <br />
  A runner towards the far spiritual light, <br />
  A child and servant of the spirit&#8217;s force. <br />
  But mind too falls back from a nameless peak. <br />
  His being stretched beyond the sight of Thought. <br />
  For the spirit is eternal and unmade <br />
  And not by thinking was its greatness born, <br />
  And not by thinking can its knowledge come. <br />
  It knows itself and in itself it lives, <br />
  It moves where no thought is nor any form. <br />
  Its feet are steadied upon finite things, <br />
  Its wings can dare to cross the Infinite. <br />
  Arriving into his ken a wonder space <br />
  Of great and marvellous meetings called his steps, <br />
  Where Thought leaned on a Vision beyond thought <br />
  And shaped a world from the Unthinkable. <br />
  On peaks imagination cannot tread, <br />
  In the horizons of a tireless sight, <br />
  Under a blue veil of eternity <br />
  The splendours of ideal Mind were seen <br />
  Outstretched across the boundaries of things known. <br />
  Origin of the little that we are, <br />
  Instinct with the endless more that we must be, <br />
  A prop of all that human strength enacts,</td>

<p>Creator of hopes by earth unrealised, <br />
  It spreads beyond the expanding universe; <br />
  It wings beyond the boundaries of Dream, <br />
  It overtops the ceiling of life&#8217;s soar. <br />
  Awake in a luminous sphere unbound by Thought, <br />
  Exposed to omniscient immensities, <br />
  It casts on our world its great crowned influences, <br />
  Its speed that outstrips the ambling of the hours, <br />
  Its force that strides invincibly through Time, <br />
  Its mights that bridge the gulf twixt man and God, <br />
  Its lights that combat Ignorance and Death. <br />
  In its vast ambit of ideal Space <br />
  Where beauty and mightiness walk hand in hand, <br />
  The Spirit&#8217;s truths take form as living Gods <br />
  And each can build a world in its own right. <br />
  In an air which doubt and error cannot mark <br />
  With the stigmata of their deformity, <br />
  In communion with the musing privacy <br />
  Of a truth that sees in an unerring light <br />
  Where the sight falters not nor wanders thought, <br />
  Exempt from our world&#8217;s exorbitant tax of tears, <br />
  Dreaming its luminous creations gaze <br />
  On the Ideas that people eternity. <br />
  In a sun-blaze of joy and absolute power <br />
  Above the Masters of the Ideal throne <br />
  In sessions of secure felicity, <br />
  In regions of illumined certitude. <br />
  Far are those realms from our labour and yearning and call, <br />
  Perfection&#8217;s reign and hallowed sanctuary <br />
  Closed to the uncertain thoughts of human mind, <br />
  Remote from the turbid tread of mortal life. <br />
  But since our secret selves are next of kin, <br />
  A breath of unattained divinity <br />
  Visits the imperfect earth on which we toil; <br />
  Across a gleaming ether&#8217;s golden laugh <br />
  A light falls on our vexed unsatisfied lives,</p>

<p>A thought comes down from the ideal worlds <br />
  And moves us to new-model even here <br />
  Some image of their greatness and appeal <br />
  And wonder beyond the ken of mortal hope. <br />
  Amid the heavy sameness of the days <br />
  And contradicted by the human law, <br />
  A faith in things that are not and must be <br />
  Lives comrade of this world&#8217;s delight and pain, <br />
  The child of the secret soul&#8217;s forbidden desire <br />
  Born of its amour with eternity. <br />
  Our spirits break free from their environment; <br />
  The future brings its face of miracle near, <br />
  Its godhead looks at us with present eyes; <br />
  Acts deemed impossible grow natural; <br />
  We feel the hero&#8217;s immortality; <br />
  The courage and the strength death cannot touch <br />
  Awake in limbs that are mortal, hearts that fail; <br />
  We move by the rapid impulse of a will <br />
  That scorns the tardy trudge of mortal time. <br />
  These promptings come not from an alien sphere: <br />
  Ourselves are citizens of that mother State, <br />
  Adventurers, we have colonised Matter&#8217;s night. <br />
  But now our rights are barred, our passports void; <br />
  We live self-exiled from our heavenlier home. <br />
  An errant ray from the immortal Mind <br />
  Accepted the earth&#8217;s blindness and became <br />
  Our human thought, servant of Ignorance. <br />
  An exile, labourer on this unsure globe <br />
  Captured and driven in Life&#8217;s nescient grasp, <br />
  Hampered by obscure cell and treacherous nerve, <br />
  It dreams of happier states and nobler powers, <br />
  The natural privilege of unfallen gods, <br />
  Recalling still its old lost sovereignty. <br />
  Amidst earth&#8217;s mist and fog and mud and stone <br />
  It still remembers its exalted sphere <br />
  And the high city of its splendid birth.</p>

<p>A memory steals in from lost heavens of Truth, <br />
  A wide release comes near, a Glory calls, <br />
  A might looks out, an estranged felicity. <br />
  In glamorous passages of half-veiled light <br />
  Wandering, a brilliant shadow of itself, <br />
  This quick uncertain leader of blind gods, <br />
  This tender of small lamps, this minister serf <br />
  Hired by a mind and body for earth-use <br />
  Forgets its work mid crude realities; <br />
  It recovers its renounced imperial right, <br />
  It wears once more a purple robe of thought <br />
  And knows itself the Ideal&#8217;s seer and king, <br />
  Communicant and prophet of the Unborn, <br />
  Heir to delight and immortality. <br />
  All things are real that here are only dreams, <br />
  In our unknown depths sleeps their reserve of truth, <br />
  On our unreached heights they reign and come to us <br />
  In thought and muse trailing their robes of light. <br />
  But our dwarf will and cold pragmatic sense <br />
  Admit not the celestial visitants: <br />
  Awaiting us on the Ideal&#8217;s peaks <br />
  Or guarded in our secret self unseen <br />
  Yet flashed sometimes across the awakened soul, <br />
  Hide from our lives their greatness, beauty, power. <br />
  Our present feels sometimes their regal touch, <br />
  Our future strives towards their luminous thrones: <br />
  Out of spiritual secrecy they gaze, <br />
  Immortal footfalls in mind&#8217;s corridors sound: <br />
  Our souls can climb into the shining planes, <br />
  The breadths from which they came can be our home. <br />
  His privilege regained of shadowless sight <br />
  The Thinker entered the immortals&#8217; air <br />
  And drank again his pure and mighty source. <br />
  Immutable in rhythmic calm and joy <br />
  He saw, sovereignly free in limitless light, <br />
  The unfallen planes, the thought-created worlds</p>

  A fragment of their puissance can be ours: <br />
  These breadths were not too broad for our souls to range, <br />
  These heights were not too high for human hope. <br />
  A triple flight led to this triple world. <br />
  Although abrupt for common strengths to tread, <br />
  Its upward slope looks down on our earth-poise: <br />

  Holding the thousand keys of the Beyond <br />
  They proffered their knowledge to the climbing mind <br />

  Illumined originals of the shadowy script <br />
  In which our sight transcribes the ideal Ray, <br />
  Or icons figuring a mystic Truth, <br />

  A march of friezes marked the lowest steps; <br />
  Fantastically ornate and richly small, <br />
  They had room for the whole meaning of a world, <br />
  Symbols minute of its perfection&#8217;s joy, <br />
  Strange beasts that were Nature&#8217;s forces made alive <br />
  And, wakened to the wonder of his role, <br />
  Man grown an image undefaced of God <br />

  And made a figurante in the cosmic dance. <br />
  Its free caprice they bound by rhythmic laws <br />
  And compelled to accept its posture and its line <br />
  In the wizardry of an ordered universe. <br />

  Oneness was carved into units measurable, <br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the play of the bright gods of Thought. <br />
  Attracting into time the timeless Light, <br />
  Imprisoning eternity in the hours, <br />
  This they have planned, to snare the feet of Truth <br />
  In an aureate net of concept and of phrase <br />
  And keep her captive for the thinker&#8217;s joy <br />
  In his little world built of immortal dreams: <br />
  There must she dwell mured in the human mind, <br />
  An empress prisoner in her subject&#8217;s house, <br />
  Adored and pure and still on his heart&#8217;s throne, <br />
  His splendid property cherished and apart <br />
  In the wall of silence of his secret muse, <br />
  Immaculate in white virginity, <br />
  The same for ever and for ever one, <br />
  His worshipped changeless Goddess through all time. <br />
  Or else, a faithful consort of his mind <br />
  Assenting to his nature and his will, <br />
  She sanctions and inspires his words and acts <br />
  Prolonging their resonance through the listening years, <br />
  Companion and recorder of his march <br />
  Crossing a brilliant tract of thought and life <br />
  Carved out of the eternity of Time. <br />
  A witness to his high triumphant star, <br />
  Her godhead servitor to a crowned Idea, <br />
  He shall dominate by her a prostrate world; <br />
  A warrant for his deeds and his beliefs, <br />
  She attests his right divine to lead and rule. <br />
  Or as a lover clasps his one beloved, <br />
  Godhead of his life&#8217;s worship and desire, <br />
  Icon of his heart&#8217;s sole idolatry, <br />
  She now is his and must live for him alone: <br />
  She has invaded him with her sudden bliss, <br />
  An exhaustless marvel in his happy grasp, <br />
  An allurement, a caught ravishing miracle. <br />
  Her now he claims after long rapt pursuit, <br />
  The one joy of his body and his soul:</p>

<p>Inescapable is her divine appeal, <br />
  Her immense possession an undying thrill, <br />
  An intoxication and an ecstasy: <br />
  The passion of her self-revealing moods, <br />
  A heavenly glory and variety, <br />
  Makes ever new her body to his eyes, <br />
  Or else repeats the first enchantment&#8217;s touch, <br />
  The luminous rapture of her mystic breasts <br />
  And beautiful vibrant limbs a living field <br />
  Of throbbing new discovery without end. <br />
  A new beginning flowers in word and laugh, <br />
  A new charm brings back the old extreme delight: <br />
  He is lost in her, she is his heaven here. <br />
  Truth smiled upon the gracious golden game. <br />
  Out of her hushed eternal spaces leaned <br />
  The great and boundless Goddess feigned to yield <br />
  The sunlit sweetness of her secrecies. <br />
  Incarnating her beauty in his clasp <br />
  She gave for a brief kiss her immortal lips <br />
  And drew to her bosom one glorified mortal head: <br />
  She made earth her home, for whom heaven was too small. <br />
  In a human breast her occult presence lived; <br />
  He carved from his own self his figure of her: <br />
  She shaped her body to a mind&#8217;s embrace. <br />
  Into thought&#8217;s narrow limits she has come; <br />
  Her greatness she has suffered to be pressed <br />
  Into the little cabin of the Idea, <br />
  The closed room of a lonely thinker&#8217;s grasp: <br />
  She has lowered her heights to the stature of our souls <br />
  And dazzled our lids with her celestial gaze. <br />
  Thus each is satisfied with his high gain <br />
  And thinks himself beyond mortality blest, <br />
  A king of truth upon his separate throne. <br />
  To her possessor in the field of Time <br />
  A single splendour caught from her glory seems <br />
  The one true light, her beauty&#8217;s glowing whole.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth: <br />
  The whole world lives in a lonely ray of her sun. <br />
  In our thinking&#8217;s close and narrow lamp-lit house <br />
  The vanity of our shut mortal mind <br />
  Dreams that the chains of thought have made her ours; <br />
  But only we play with our own brilliant bonds; <br />
  Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie. <br />
  In our hypnosis by one luminous point <br />
  We see not what small figure of her we hold; <br />
  We feel not her inspiring boundlessness, <br />
  We share not her immortal liberty. <br />
  Thus is it even with the seer and sage; <br />
  For still the human limits the divine: <br />
  Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight, <br />
  Breathe her divine illimitable air, <br />
  Her simple vast supremacy confess, <br />
  Dare to surrender to her absolute. <br />
  Then the Unmanifest reflects his form <br />
  In the still mind as in a living glass; <br />
  The timeless Ray descends into our hearts <br />
  And we are rapt into eternity. <br />
  For Truth is wider, greater than her forms. <br />
  A thousand icons they have made of her <br />
  And find her in the idols they adore; <br />
  But she remains herself and infinite. </p>
