<p>A mind absolved from life, made calm to know, <br />
  A heart divorced from the blindness and the pang, <br />
  The seal of tears, the bond of ignorance, <br />
  He turned to find that wide world-failure&#8217;s cause. <br />
  Away he looked from Nature&#8217;s visible face <br />
  And sent his gaze into the viewless Vast, <br />
  The formidable unknown Infinity, <br />
  Asleep behind the endless coil of things, <br />
  That carries the universe in its timeless breadths <br />
  And the ripples of its being are our lives. <br />
  The worlds are built by its unconscious Breath <br />
  And Matter and Mind are its figures or its powers, <br />
  Our waking thoughts the output of its dreams. <br />
  The veil was rent that covers Nature&#8217;s depths: <br />
  He saw the fount of the world&#8217;s lasting pain <br />
  And the mouth of the black pit of Ignorance; <br />
  The evil guarded at the roots of life <br />
  Raised up its head and looked into his eyes. <br />
  On a dim bank where dies subjective Space, <br />
  From a stark ridge overlooking all that is, <br />
  A tenebrous awakened Nescience, <br />
  Her wide blank eyes wondering at Time and Form, <br />
  Stared at the inventions of the living Void <br />
  And the Abyss whence our beginnings rose. <br />
  Behind appeared a grey carved mask of Night <br />
  Watching the birth of all created things. <br />
  A hidden Puissance conscious of its force, <br />
  A vague and lurking Presence everywhere, <br />
  A contrary Doom that threatens all things made, <br />
  A Death figuring as the dark seed of life, <br />
  Seemed to engender and to slay the world.</p>

<p>Then from the sombre mystery of the gulfs <br />
  And from the hollow bosom of the Mask <br />
  Something crept forth that seemed a shapeless Thought. <br />
  A fatal Influence upon creatures stole <br />
  Whose lethal touch pursued the immortal spirit, <br />
  On life was laid the haunting finger of death <br />
  And overcast with error, grief and pain <br />
  The soul&#8217;s native will for truth and joy and light. <br />
  A deformation coiled that claimed to be <br />
  The being&#8217;s very turn, Nature&#8217;s true drive. <br />
  A hostile and perverting Mind at work <br />
  In every corner ensconced of conscious life <br />
  Corrupted Truth with her own formulas; <br />
  Interceptor of the listening of the soul, <br />
  Afflicting knowledge with the hue of doubt <br />
  It captured the oracles of the occult gods, <br />
  Effaced the signposts of Life&#8217;s pilgrimage, <br />
  Cancelled the firm rock-edicts graved by Time, <br />
  And on the foundations of the cosmic Law <br />
  Erected its bronze pylons of misrule. <br />
  Even Light and Love by that cloaked danger&#8217;s spell <br />
  Turned from the brilliant nature of the gods <br />
  To fallen angels and misleading suns, <br />
  Became themselves a danger and a charm, <br />
  A perverse sweetness, heaven-born malefice: <br />
  Its power could deform divinest things. <br />
  A wind of sorrow breathed upon the world; <br />
  All thought with falsehood was besieged, all act <br />
  Stamped with defect or with frustration&#8217;s sign, <br />
  All high attempt with failure or vain success, <br />
  But none could know the reason of his fall. <br />
  The grey Mask whispered and, though no sound was heard, <br />
  Yet in the ignorant heart a seed was sown <br />
  That bore black fruit of suffering, death and bale. <br />
  Out of the chill steppes of a bleak Unseen <br />
  Invisible, wearing the Night&#8217;s grey mask,</p>

<p>Arrived the shadowy dreadful messengers, <br />
  Invaders from a dangerous world of power, <br />
  Ambassadors of evil&#8217;s absolute. <br />
  In silence the inaudible voices spoke, <br />
  Hands that none saw planted the fatal grain, <br />
  No form was seen, yet a dire work was done, <br />
  An iron decree in crooked uncials written <br />
  Imposed a law of sin and adverse fate. <br />
  Life looked at him with changed and sombre eyes: <br />
  Her beauty he saw and the yearning heart in things <br />
  That with a little happiness is content, <br />
  Answering to a small ray of truth or love; <br />
  He saw her gold sunlight and her far blue sky, <br />
  Her green of leaves and hue and scent of flowers <br />
  And the charm of children and the love of friends <br />
  And the beauty of women and kindly hearts of men, <br />
  But saw too the dreadful Powers that drive her moods <br />
  And the anguish she has strewn upon her ways, <br />
  Fate waiting on the unseen steps of men <br />
  And her evil and sorrow and last gift of death. <br />
  A breath of disillusion and decadence <br />
  Corrupting watched for Life&#8217;s maturity <br />
  And made to rot the full grain of the soul: <br />
  Progress became a purveyor of Death. <br />
  A world that clung to the law of a slain Light <br />
  Cherished the putrid corpses of dead truths, <br />
  Hailed twisted forms as things free, new and true, <br />
  Beauty from ugliness and evil drank <br />
  Feeling themselves guests at a banquet of the gods <br />
  And tasted corruption like a high-spiced food. <br />
  A darkness settled on the heavy air; <br />
  It hunted the bright smile from Nature&#8217;s lips <br />
  And slew the native confidence in her heart <br />
  And put fear&#8217;s crooked look into her eyes. <br />
  The lust that warps the spirit&#8217;s natural good <br />
  Replaced by a manufactured virtue and vice</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">The frank spontaneous impulse of the soul: <br />
  Afflicting Nature with the dual&#8217;s lie, <br />
  Their twin values whetted a forbidden zest, <br />
  Made evil a relief from spurious good, <br />
  The ego battened on righteousness and sin <br />
  And each became an instrument of Hell. <br />
  In rejected heaps by a monotonous road <br />
  The old simple delights were left to lie <br />
  On the wasteland of life&#8217;s descent to Night. <br />
  All glory of life was dimmed, tarnished with doubt; <br />
  All beauty ended in an aging face; <br />
  All power was dubbed a tyranny cursed by God <br />
  And Truth a fiction needed by the mind: <br />
  The chase of joy was now a tired hunt; <br />
  All knowledge was left a questioning Ignorance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As from a womb obscure he saw emerge <br />
  The body and visage of a dark Unseen <br />
  Hidden behind the fair outsides of life. <br />
  Its dangerous commerce is our suffering&#8217;s cause. <br />
  Its breath is a subtle poison in men&#8217;s hearts; <br />
  All evil starts from that ambiguous face. <br />
  A peril haunted now the common air; <br />
  The world grew full of menacing Energies, <br />
  And wherever turned for help or hope his eyes, <br />
  In field and house, in street and camp and mart <br />
  He met the prowl and stealthy come and go <br />
  Of armed disquieting bodied Influences. <br />
  A march of goddess figures dark and nude <br />
  Alarmed the air with grandiose unease; <br />
  Appalling footsteps drew invisibly near, <br />
  Shapes that were threats invaded the dream-light, <br />
  And ominous beings passed him on the road <br />
  Whose very gaze was a calamity: <br />
  A charm and sweetness sudden and formidable, <br />
  Faces that raised alluring lips and eyes</p>

<p>Approached him armed with beauty like a snare, <br />
  But hid a fatal meaning in each line <br />
  And could in a moment dangerously change. <br />
  But he alone discerned that screened attack. <br />
  A veil upon the inner vision lay, <br />
  A force was there that hid its dreadful steps; <br />
  All was belied, yet thought itself the truth; <br />
  All were beset but knew not of the siege: <br />
  For none could see the authors of their fall. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Aware of some dark wisdom still withheld <br />
  That was the seal and warrant of this strength, <br />
  He followed the track of dim tremendous steps <br />
  Returning to the night from which they came. <br />
  A tract he reached unbuilt and owned by none: <br />
  There all could enter but none stay for long. <br />
  It was a no man&#8217;s land of evil air, <br />
  A crowded neighbourhood without one home, <br />
  A borderland between the world and hell. <br />
  There unreality was Nature&#8217;s lord: <br />
  It was a space where nothing could be true, <br />
  For nothing was what it had claimed to be: <br />
  A high appearance wrapped a specious void. <br />
  Yet nothing would confess its own pretence <br />
  Even to itself in the ambiguous heart: <br />
  A vast deception was the law of things; <br />
  Only by that deception they could live. <br />
  An unsubstantial Nihil guaranteed <br />
  The falsehood of the forms this Nature took <br />
  And made them seem awhile to be and live. <br />
  A borrowed magic drew them from the Void; <br />
  They took a shape and stuff that was not theirs <br />
  And showed a colour that they could not keep, <br />
  Mirrors to a phantasm of reality. <br />
  Each rainbow brilliance was a splendid lie; <br />
  A beauty unreal graced a glamour face. <br />
  Nothing could be relied on to remain:</p>

<p>Joy nurtured tears and good an evil proved, <br />
  But never out of evil one plucked good: <br />
  Love ended early in hate, delight killed with pain, <br />
  Truth into falsity grew and death ruled life. <br />
  A Power that laughed at the mischiefs of the world, <br />
  An irony that joined the world&#8217;s contraries <br />
  And flung them into each other&#8217;s arms to strive, <br />
  Put a sardonic rictus on God&#8217;s face. <br />
  Aloof, its influence entered everywhere <br />
  And left a cloven hoof-mark on the breast; <br />
  A twisted heart and a strange sombre smile <br />
  Mocked at the sinister comedy of life. <br />
  Announcing the advent of a perilous Form <br />
  An ominous tread softened its dire footfall <br />
  That none might understand or be on guard; <br />
  None heard until a dreadful grasp was close. <br />
  Or else all augured a divine approach, <br />
  An air of prophecy felt, a heavenly hope, <br />
  Listened for a gospel, watched for a new star. <br />
  The Fiend was visible but cloaked in light; <br />
  He seemed a helping angel from the skies: <br />
  He armed untruth with Scripture and the Law; <br />
  He deceived with wisdom, with virtue slew the soul <br />
  And led to perdition by the heavenward path. <br />
  A lavish sense he gave of power and joy, <br />
  And, when arose the warning from within, <br />
  He reassured the ear with dulcet tones <br />
  Or took the mind captive in its own net; <br />
  His rigorous logic made the false seem true. <br />
  Amazing the elect with holy lore <br />
  He spoke as with the very voice of God. <br />
  The air was full of treachery and ruse; <br />
  Truth-speaking was a stratagem in that place; <br />
  Ambush lurked in a smile and peril made <br />
  Safety its cover, trust its entry&#8217;s gate: <br />
  Falsehood came laughing with the eyes of truth;</p>

  The hand one clasped ensleeved a dagger&#8217;s stab <br />
  And an embrace could be Doom&#8217;s iron cage. <br />
  Agony and danger stalked their trembling prey <br />
  And softly spoke as to a timid friend: <br />
  Attack sprang suddenly vehement and unseen; <br />
  Fear leaped upon the heart at every turn <br />
  And cried out with an anguished dreadful voice; <br />
  It called for one to save but none came near. <br />
  All warily walked, for death was ever close; <br />
  Yet caution seemed a vain expense of care, <br />
  For all that guarded proved a deadly net, <br />
  And when after long suspense salvation came <br />
  And brought a glad relief disarming strength, <br />
  It served as a smiling passage to worse fate. <br />
  There was no truce and no safe place to rest; <br />
  One dared not slumber or put off one&#8217;s arms: <br />
  It was a world of battle and surprise. <br />
  All who were there lived for themselves alone; <br />
  All warred against all, but with a common hate <br />
  Turned on the mind that sought some higher good; <br />
  Truth was exiled lest she should dare to speak <br />
  And hurt the heart of darkness with her light <br />
  Or bring her pride of knowledge to blaspheme <br />
  The settled anarchy of established things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the scene changed, but kept its dreadful core: <br />
  Altering its form the life remained the same. <br />
  A capital was there without a State: <br />
  It had no ruler, only groups that strove. <br />
  He saw a city of ancient Ignorance <br />
  Founded upon a soil that knew not Light. <br />
  There each in his own darkness walked alone: <br />
  Only they agreed to differ in Evil&#8217;s paths, <br />
  To live in their own way for their own selves <br />
  Or to enforce a common lie and wrong;</p>

  The world turned to them as Heaven to Truth and God. <br />
  Injustice justified by firm decrees <br />
  The sovereign weights of Error&#8217;s legalised trade, <br />
  But all the weights were false and none the same; <br />

  Each group proclaimed its dire and naked Law. <br />

  A formal practice mailed and iron-shod <br />
  Gave to a rude and ruthless warrior kind <br />
  Drawn from the savage bowels of the earth <br />
  A proud stern poise of harsh nobility, <br />
  A civic posture rigid and formidable. <br />
  But all their private acts belied the pose: <br />

  An eagle rapacity clawed its coveted good, <br />
  Beaks pecked and talons tore all weaker prey. <br />
  In their sweet secrecy of pleasant sins <br />
  Nature they obeyed and not a moralist God. <br />
  Inconscient traders in bundles of contraries, <br />
  They did what in others they would persecute; <br />
  When their eyes looked upon their fellow&#8217;s vice, <br />
  An indignation flamed, a virtuous wrath; <br />
  Oblivious of their own deep-hid offence, <br />
  Moblike they stoned a neighbour caught in sin. <br />

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Or only it repeated lessons taught, <br />
  While mitred, holding the good shepherd&#8217;s staff, <br />
  Falsehood enthroned on awed and prostrate hearts <br />
  The cults and creeds that organise living death <br />
  And slay the soul on the altar of a lie. <br />
  All were deceived or served their own deceit; <br />
  Truth in that stifling atmosphere could not live. <br />
  There wretchedness believed in its own joy <br />
  And fear and weakness hugged their abject depths; <br />
  All that is low and sordid-thoughted, base, <br />
  All that is drab and poor and miserable, <br />
  Breathed in a lax content its natural air <br />
  And felt no yearning of divine release: <br />
  Arrogant, gibing at more luminous states <br />
  The people of the gulfs despised the sun. <br />
  A barriered autarchy excluded light; <br />
  Fixed in its will to be its own grey self, <br />
  It vaunted its norm unique and splendid type: <br />
  It soothed its hunger with a plunderer&#8217;s dream; <br />
  Flaunting its cross of servitude like a crown, <br />
  It clung to its dismal harsh autonomy. <br />
  A bull-throat bellowed with its brazen tongue; <br />
  Its hard and shameless clamour filling Space <br />
  And threatening all who dared to listen to truth <br />
  Claimed the monopoly of the battered ear; <br />
  A deafened acquiescence gave its vote, <br />
  And braggart dogmas shouted in the night <br />
  Kept for the fallen soul once deemed a god <br />
  The pride of its abysmal absolute. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A lone discoverer in these menacing realms <br />
  Guarded like termite cities from the sun, <br />
  Oppressed mid crowd and tramp and noise and flare, <br />
  Passing from dusk to deeper dangerous dusk, <br />
  He wrestled with powers that snatched from mind its light <br />
  And smote from him their clinging influences.</p>

<p>Soon he emerged in a dim wall-less space. <br />
  For now the peopled tracts were left behind; <br />
  He walked between wide banks of failing eve. <br />
  Around him grew a gaunt spiritual blank, <br />
  A threatening waste, a sinister loneliness <br />
  That left mind bare to an unseen assault, <br />
  An empty page on which all that willed could write <br />
  Stark monstrous messages without control. <br />
  A travelling dot on downward roads of Dusk <br />
  Mid barren fields and barns and straggling huts <br />
  And a few crooked and phantasmal trees, <br />
  He faced a sense of death and conscious void. <br />
  But still a hostile Life unseen was there <br />
  Whose deathlike poise resisting light and truth <br />
  Made living a bleak gap in nullity. <br />
  He heard the grisly voices that deny; <br />
  Assailed by thoughts that swarmed like spectral hordes, <br />
  A prey to the staring phantoms of the gloom <br />
  And terror approaching with its lethal mouth, <br />
  Driven by a strange will down ever down, <br />
  The sky above a communiqu&Ccedil; of Doom, <br />
  He strove to shield his spirit from despair, <br />
  But felt the horror of the growing Night <br />
  And the Abyss rising to claim his soul. <br />
  Then ceased the abodes of creatures and their forms <br />
  And solitude wrapped him in its voiceless folds. <br />
  All vanished suddenly like a thought expunged; <br />
  His spirit became an empty listening gulf <br />
  Void of the dead illusion of a world: <br />
  Nothing was left, not even an evil face. <br />
  He was alone with the grey python Night. <br />
  A dense and nameless Nothing conscious, mute, <br />
  Which seemed alive but without body or mind, <br />
  Lusted all beings to annihilate <br />
  That it might be for ever nude and sole. <br />
  As in a shapeless beast&#8217;s intangible jaws,</p>

<p>Gripped, strangled by that lusting viscous blot, <br />
  Attracted to some black and giant mouth <br />
  And swallowing throat and a huge belly of doom, <br />
  His being from its own vision disappeared <br />
  Drawn towards depths that hungered for its fall. <br />
  A formless void oppressed his struggling brain, <br />
  A darkness grim and cold benumbed his flesh, <br />
  A whispered grey suggestion chilled his heart; <br />
  Haled by a serpent-force from its warm home <br />
  And dragged to extinction in bleak vacancy <br />
  Life clung to its seat with cords of gasping breath; <br />
  Lapped was his body by a tenebrous tongue. <br />
  Existence smothered travailed to survive; <br />
  Hope strangled perished in his empty soul, <br />
  Belief and memory abolished died <br />
  And all that helps the spirit in its course. <br />
  There crawled through every tense and aching nerve <br />
  Leaving behind its poignant quaking trail <br />
  A nameless and unutterable fear. <br />
  As a sea nears a victim bound and still, <br />
  The approach alarmed his mind for ever dumb <br />
  Of an implacable eternity <br />
  Of pain inhuman and intolerable. <br />
  This he must bear, his hope of heaven estranged; <br />
  He must ever exist without extinction&#8217;s peace <br />
  In a slow suffering Time and tortured Space, <br />
  An anguished nothingness his endless state. <br />
  A lifeless vacancy was now his breast, <br />
  And in the place where once was luminous thought, <br />
  Only remained like a pale motionless ghost <br />
  An incapacity for faith and hope <br />
  And the dread conviction of a vanquished soul <br />
  Immortal still but with its godhead lost, <br />
  Self lost and God and touch of happier worlds. <br />
  But he endured, stilled the vain terror, bore <br />
  The smothering coils of agony and affright;</p>

  To the blank horror a calm Light replied: <br />
  Immutable, undying and unborn, <br />
  Mighty and mute the Godhead in him woke <br />
  And faced the pain and danger of the world. <br />
  He mastered the tides of Nature with a look: <br />
  He met with his bare spirit naked Hell. </p>
