<p>In the impalpable field of secret self, <br />
  This little outer being&#8217;s vast support <br />
  Parted from vision by earth&#8217;s solid fence, <br />
  He came into a magic crystal air <br />
  And found a life that lived not by the flesh, <br />
  A light that made visible immaterial things. <br />
  A fine degree in wonder&#8217;s hierarchy, <br />
  The kingdom of subtle Matter&#8217;s faery craft <br />
  Outlined against a sky of vivid hues, <br />
  Leaping out of a splendour-trance and haze, <br />
  The wizard revelation of its front. <br />
  A world of lovelier forms lies near to ours, <br />
  Where, undisguised by earth&#8217;s deforming sight, <br />
  All shapes are beautiful and all things true. <br />
  In that lucent ambience mystically clear <br />
  The eyes were doors to a celestial sense, <br />
  Hearing was music and the touch a charm, <br />
  And the heart drew a deeper breath of power. <br />
  There dwell earth-nature&#8217;s shining origins: <br />
  The perfect plans on which she moulds her works, <br />
  The distant outcomes of her travailing force, <br />
  Repose in a framework of established fate. <br />
  Attempted vainly now or won in vain, <br />
  Already were mapped and scheduled there the time <br />
  And figure of her future sovereignties <br />
  In the sumptuous lineaments traced by desire. <br />
  The golden issue of mind&#8217;s labyrinth plots, <br />
  The riches unfound or still uncaught by our lives, <br />
  Unsullied by the attaint of mortal thought <br />
  Abide in that pellucid atmosphere. <br />
  Our vague beginnings are overtaken there,</p>

<p>Our middle terms sketched out in prescient lines, <br />
  Our finished ends anticipated live. <br />
  This brilliant roof of our descending plane, <br />
  Intercepting the free boon of heaven&#8217;s air, <br />
  Admits small inrushes of a mighty breath <br />
  Or fragrant circuits through gold lattices; <br />
  It shields our ceiling of terrestrial mind <br />
  From deathless suns and the streaming of God&#8217;s rain, <br />
  Yet canalises a strange irised glow, <br />
  And bright dews drip from the Immortal&#8217;s sky. <br />
  A passage for the Powers that move our days, <br />
  Occult behind this grosser Nature&#8217;s walls, <br />
  A gossamer marriage-hall of Mind with Form <br />
  Is hidden by a tapestry of dreams; <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s meanings steal through it as through a veil, <br />
  Its inner sight sustains this outer scene. <br />
  A finer consciousness with happier lines, <br />
  It has a tact our touch cannot attain, <br />
  A purity of sense we never feel; <br />
  Its intercession with the eternal Ray <br />
  Inspires our transient earth&#8217;s brief-lived attempts <br />
  At beauty and the perfect shape of things. <br />
  In rooms of the young divinity of power <br />
  And early play of the eternal Child <br />
  The embodiments of his outwinging thoughts <br />
  Laved in a bright everlasting wonder&#8217;s tints <br />
  And lulled by whispers of that lucid air <br />
  Take dream-hued rest like birds on timeless trees <br />
  Before they dive to float on earth-time&#8217;s sea. <br />
  All that here seems has lovelier semblance there. <br />
  Whatever our hearts conceive, our heads create, <br />
  Some high original beauty forfeiting, <br />
  Thence exiled here consents to an earthly tinge. <br />
  Whatever is here of visible charm and grace <br />
  Finds there its faultless and immortal lines; <br />
  All that is beautiful here is there divine.</p>

<p>Figures are there undreamed by mortal mind: <br />
  Bodies that have no earthly counterpart <br />
  Traverse the inner eye&#8217;s illumined trance <br />
  And ravish the heart with their celestial tread <br />
  Persuading heaven to inhabit that wonder sphere. <br />
  The future&#8217;s marvels wander in its gulfs; <br />
  Things old and new are fashioned in those depths: <br />
  A carnival of beauty crowds the heights <br />
  In that magic kingdom of ideal sight. <br />
  In its antechambers of splendid privacy <br />
  Matter and soul in conscious union meet <br />
  Like lovers in a lonely secret place: <br />
  In the clasp of a passion not yet unfortunate <br />
  They join their strength and sweetness and delight <br />
  And mingling make the high and low worlds one. <br />
  Intruder from the formless Infinite <br />
  Daring to break into the Inconscient&#8217;s reign, <br />
  The spirit&#8217;s leap towards body touches ground. <br />
  As yet unwrapped in earthly lineaments, <br />
  Already it wears outlasting death and birth, <br />
  Convincing the abyss by heavenly form, <br />
  A covering of its immortality <br />
  Alive to the lustre of the wearer&#8217;s rank, <br />
  Fit to endure the rub of Change and Time. <br />
  A tissue mixed of the soul&#8217;s radiant light <br />
  And Matter&#8217;s substance of sign-burdened Force,&#8211; <br />
  Imagined vainly in our mind&#8217;s thin air <br />
  An abstract phantasm mould of mental make,&#8211; <br />
  It feels what earthly bodies cannot feel <br />
  And is more real than this grosser frame. <br />
  After the falling of mortality&#8217;s cloak <br />
  Lightened is its weight to heighten its ascent; <br />
  Refined to the touch of finer environments <br />
  It drops old patterned palls of denser stuff, <br />
  Cancels the grip of earth&#8217;s descending pull <br />
  And bears the soul from world to higher world,</p>

<p>Till in the naked ether of the peaks <br />
  The spirit&#8217;s simplicity alone is left, <br />
  The eternal being&#8217;s first transparent robe. <br />
  But when it must come back to its mortal load <br />
  And the hard ensemble of earth&#8217;s experience, <br />
  Then its return resumes that heavier dress. <br />
  For long before earth&#8217;s solid vest was forged <br />
  By the technique of the atomic Void, <br />
  A lucent envelope of self-disguise <br />
  Was woven round the secret spirit in things. <br />
  The subtle realms from those bright sheaths are made. <br />
  This wonder-world with all its radiant boon <br />
  Of vision and inviolate happiness, <br />
  Only for expression cares and perfect form; <br />
  Fair on its peaks, it has dangerous nether planes; <br />
  Its light draws towards the verge of Nature&#8217;s lapse; <br />
  It lends beauty to the terror of the gulfs <br />
  And fascinating eyes to perilous Gods, <br />
  Invests with grace the demon and the snake. <br />
  Its trance imposes earth&#8217;s inconscience, <br />
  Immortal it weaves for us death&#8217;s sombre robe <br />
  And authorises our mortality. <br />
  This medium serves a greater Consciousness: <br />
  A vessel of its concealed autocracy, <br />
  It is the subtle ground of Matter&#8217;s worlds, <br />
  It is the immutable in their mutable forms, <br />
  In the folds of its creative memory <br />
  It guards the deathless type of perishing things: <br />
  Its lowered potencies found our fallen strengths; <br />
  Its thought invents our reasoned ignorance; <br />
  Its sense fathers our body&#8217;s reflexes. <br />
  Our secret breath of untried mightier force, <br />
  The lurking sun of an instant&#8217;s inner sight, <br />
  Its fine suggestions are a covert fount <br />
  For our iridescent rich imaginings <br />
  Touching things common with transfiguring hues</p>

  A heaven of creative truths above, <br />

  Out of its fall our denser Matter came. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus taken was God&#8217;s plunge into the Night. <br />
  This fallen world became a nurse of souls <br />
  Inhabited by concealed divinity. <br />
  A Being woke and lived in the meaningless void, <br />
  A world-wide Nescience strove towards life and thought, <br />
  A Consciousness plucked out from mindless sleep. <br />
  All here is driven by an insentient will. <br />
  Thus fallen, inconscient, frustrate, dense, inert, <br />
  Sunk into inanimate and torpid drowse <br />
  Earth lay, a drudge of sleep, forced to create <br />
  By a subconscient yearning memory <br />
  Left from a happiness dead before she was born, <br />
  An alien wonder on her senseless breast. <br />
  This mire must harbour the orchid and the rose, <br />
  From her blind unwilling substance must emerge <br />
  A beauty that belongs to happier spheres. <br />
  This is the destiny bequeathed to her, <br />
  As if a slain god left a golden trust <br />
  To a blind force and an imprisoned soul. <br />
  An immortal godhead&#8217;s perishable parts <br />
  She must reconstitute from fragments lost, <br />
  Reword from a document complete elsewhere <br />
  Her doubtful title to her divine Name. <br />
  A residue her sole inheritance, <br />
  All things she carries in her shapeless dust.</p>

  And given to man as his stupendous work <br />
  A labour to the gods impossible. <br />
  A life living hardly in a field of death <br />

  A Splendour presses or a Power breaks through, <br />
  Earth&#8217;s great dull barrier is removed awhile, <br />

<p>A thought from the eternal Mind draws near, <br />
  Intimations cast from the Invisible <br />
  Awaking from Infinity&#8217;s sleep come down, <br />
  Symbols of That which never yet was made. <br />
  But soon the inert flesh responds no more, <br />
  Then sinks the sacred orgy of delight, <br />
  The blaze of passion and the tide of power <br />
  Are taken from us and, though a glowing form <br />
  Abides astonishing earth, imagined supreme, <br />
  Too little of what was meant has left a trace. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s eyes half-see, her forces half-create; <br />
  Her rarest works are copies of heaven&#8217;s art. <br />
  A radiance of a golden artifice, <br />
  A masterpiece of inspired device and rule, <br />
  Her forms hide what they house and only mime <br />
  The unseized miracle of self-born shapes <br />
  That live for ever in the Eternal&#8217;s gaze. <br />
  Here in a difficult half-finished world <br />
  Is a slow toiling of unconscious Powers; <br />
  Here is man&#8217;s ignorant divining mind, <br />
  His genius born from an inconscient soil. <br />
  To copy on earth&#8217;s copies is his art. <br />
  For when he strives for things surpassing earth, <br />
  Too rude the workman&#8217;s tools, too crude his stuff, <br />
  And hardly with his heart&#8217;s blood he achieves <br />
  His transient house of the divine Idea, <br />
  His figure of a Time-inn for the Unborn. <br />
  Our being thrills with high far memories <br />
  And would bring down their dateless meanings here, <br />
  But, too divine for earthly Nature&#8217;s scheme, <br />
  Beyond our reach the eternal marvels blaze. <br />
  Absolute they dwell, unborn, immutable, <br />
  Immaculate in the Spirit&#8217;s deathless air, <br />
  Immortal in a world of motionless Time <br />
  And an unchanging muse of deep self-space. <br />
  Only when we have climbed above ourselves,</p>

<p>A line of the Transcendent meets our road <br />
  And joins us to the timeless and the true; <br />
  It brings to us the inevitable word, <br />
  The godlike act, the thoughts that never die. <br />
  A ripple of light and glory wraps the brain, <br />
  And travelling down the moment&#8217;s vanishing route <br />
  The figures of eternity arrive. <br />
  As the mind&#8217;s visitors or the heart&#8217;s guests <br />
  They espouse our mortal brevity awhile, <br />
  Or seldom in some rare delivering glimpse <br />
  Are caught by our vision&#8217;s delicate surmise. <br />
  Although beginnings only and first attempts, <br />
  These glimmerings point to the secret of our birth <br />
  And the hidden miracle of our destiny. <br />
  What we are there and here on earth shall be <br />
  Is imaged in a contact and a call. <br />
  As yet earth&#8217;s imperfection is our sphere, <br />
  Our nature&#8217;s glass shows not our real self; <br />
  That greatness still abides held back within. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s doubting future hides our heritage: <br />
  The Light now distant shall grow native here, <br />
  The Strength that visits us our comrade power; <br />
  The Ineffable shall find a secret voice, <br />
  The Imperishable burn through Matter&#8217;s screen <br />
  Making this mortal body godhead&#8217;s robe. <br />
  The Spirit&#8217;s greatness is our timeless source <br />
  And it shall be our crown in endless Time. <br />
  A vast Unknown is round us and within; <br />
  All things are wrapped in the dynamic One: <br />
  A subtle link of union joins all life. <br />
  Thus all creation is a single chain: <br />
  We are not left alone in a closed scheme <br />
  Between a driving of inconscient Force <br />
  And an incommunicable Absolute. <br />
  Our life is a spur in a sublime soul-range, <br />
  Our being looks beyond its walls of mind</p>

<p>And it communicates with greater worlds; <br />
  There are brighter earths and wider heavens than ours. <br />
  There are realms where Being broods in its own depths; <br />
  It feels in its immense dynamic core <br />
  Its nameless, unformed, unborn potencies <br />
  Cry for expression in the unshaped Vast: <br />
  Ineffable beyond Ignorance and death, <br />
  The images of its everlasting Truth <br />
  Look out from a chamber of its self-rapt soul: <br />
  As if to its own inner witness gaze <br />

  The power and passion of its timeless heart, <br />
  The figures of its formless ecstasy, <br />

  Thence comes the mystic substance of our souls <br />
  Into the prodigy of our nature&#8217;s birth, <br />
  There is the unfallen height of all we are <br />
  And dateless fount of all we hope to be. <br />
  On every plane the hieratic Power, <br />
  Initiate of unspoken verities, <br />
  Dreams to transcribe and make a part of life <br />
  In its own native style and living tongue <br />
  Some trait of the perfection of the Unborn, <br />
  Some vision seen in the omniscient Light, <br />
  Some far tone of the immortal rhapsodist Voice, <br />
  Some rapture of the all-creating Bliss, <br />
  Some form and plan of the Beauty unutterable. <br />
  Worlds are there nearer to those absolute realms, <br />
  Where the response to Truth is swift and sure <br />
  And spirit is not hampered by its frame <br />
  And hearts by sharp division seized and rent <br />
  And delight and beauty are inhabitants <br />
  And love and sweetness are the law of life. <br />
  A finer substance in a subtler mould <br />
  Embodies the divinity earth but dreams; <br />
  Its strength can overtake joy&#8217;s running feet;</p>

<p>Overleaping the fixed hurdles set by Time, <br />
  The rapid net of an intuitive clasp <br />
  Captures the fugitive happiness we desire. <br />
  A Nature lifted by a larger breath, <br />
  Plastic and passive to the all-shaping Fire, <br />
  Answers the flaming Godhead&#8217;s casual touch: <br />
  Immune from our inertia of response <br />
  It hears the word to which our hearts are deaf, <br />
  Adopts the seeing of immortal eyes <br />
  And, traveller on the roads of line and hue, <br />
  Pursues the spirit of beauty to its home. <br />
  Thus we draw near to the All-Wonderful <br />
  Following his rapture in things as sign and guide; <br />
  Beauty is his footprint showing us where he has passed, <br />
  Love is his heart-beats&#8217; rhythm in mortal breasts, <br />
  Happiness the smile on his adorable face. <br />
  A communion of spiritual entities, <br />
  A genius of creative Immanence, <br />
  Makes all creation deeply intimate: <br />
  A fourth dimension of aesthetic sense <br />
  Where all is in ourselves, ourselves in all, <br />
  To the cosmic wideness re-aligns our souls. <br />
  A kindling rapture joins the seer and seen; <br />
  The craftsman and the craft grown inly one <br />
  Achieve perfection by the magic throb <br />
  And passion of their close identity. <br />
  All that we slowly piece from gathered parts, <br />
  Or by long labour stumblingly evolve, <br />
  Is there self-born by its eternal right. <br />
  In us too the intuitive Fire can burn; <br />
  An agent Light, it is coiled in our folded hearts, <br />
  On the celestial levels is its home: <br />
  Descending, it can bring those heavens here. <br />
  But rarely burns the flame nor burns for long; <br />
  The joy it calls from those diviner heights <br />
  Brings brief magnificent reminiscences</p>

  Our souls forget to the Highest to aspire. </p>

  Exempt from the ordeal and the test, <br />
  Empty of opposition and of pain, <br />
  It was a world that could not fear nor grieve. <br />
  It had no grace of error or defeat, <br />
  It had no room for fault, no power to fail. <br />
  Out of some packed self-bliss it drew at once <br />
  Its form-discoveries of the mute Idea <br />

  Its clear technique of firm and rounded lives,</p>
