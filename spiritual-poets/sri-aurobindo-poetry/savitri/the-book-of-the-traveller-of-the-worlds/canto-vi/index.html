<p>As one who between dim receding walls <br />
  Towards the far gleam of a tunnel&#8217;s mouth, <br />
  Hoping for light, walks now with freer pace <br />
  And feels approach a breath of wider air, <br />
  So he escaped from that grey anarchy. <br />
  Into an ineffectual world he came, <br />
  A purposeless region of arrested birth <br />
  Where being from non-being fled and dared <br />
  To live but had no strength long to abide. <br />
  Above there gleamed a pondering brow of sky <br />
  Tormented, crossed by wings of doubtful haze <br />
  Adventuring with a voice of roaming winds <br />
  And crying for a direction in the void <br />
  Like blind souls looking for the selves they lost <br />
  And wandering through unfamiliar worlds; <br />
  Wings of vague questioning met the query of Space. <br />
  After denial dawned a dubious hope, <br />
  A hope of self and form and leave to live <br />
  And the birth of that which never yet could be, <br />
  And joy of the mind&#8217;s hazard, the heart&#8217;s choice, <br />
  Grace of the unknown and hands of sudden surprise <br />
  And a touch of sure delight in unsure things: <br />
  To a strange uncertain tract his journey came <br />
  Where consciousness played with unconscious self <br />
  And birth was an attempt or episode. <br />
  A charm drew near that could not keep its spell, <br />
  An eager Power that could not find its way, <br />
  A Chance that chose a strange arithmetic <br />
  But could not bind with it the forms it made, <br />
  A multitude that could not guard its sum <br />
  Which less than zero grew and more than one.</p>

<p>Arriving at a large and shadowy sense <br />
  That cared not to define its fleeting drift, <br />
  Life laboured in a strange and mythic air <br />
  Denuded of her sweet magnificent suns. <br />
  In worlds imagined, never yet made true, <br />
  A lingering glimmer on creation&#8217;s verge, <br />
  One strayed and dreamed and never stopped to achieve: <br />
  To achieve would have destroyed that magic Space. <br />
  The marvels of a twilight wonderland <br />
  Full of a beauty strangely, vainly made, <br />
  A surge of fanciful realities, <br />
  Dim tokens of a Splendour sealed above, <br />
  Awoke the passion of the eyes&#8217; desire, <br />
  Compelled belief on the enamoured thought <br />
  And drew the heart but led it to no goal. <br />
  A magic flowed as if of moving scenes <br />
  That kept awhile their fugitive delicacy <br />
  Of sparing lines limned by an abstract art <br />
  In a rare scanted light with faint dream-brush <br />
  On a silver background of incertitude. <br />
  An infant glow of heavens near to morn, <br />
  A fire intense conceived but never lit, <br />
  Caressed the air with ardent hints of day. <br />
  The perfect longing for imperfection&#8217;s charm, <br />
  The illumined caught by the snare of Ignorance, <br />
  Ethereal creatures drawn by body&#8217;s lure <br />
  To that region of promise, beating invisible wings, <br />
  Came hungry for the joy of finite life <br />
  But too divine to tread created soil <br />
  And share the fate of perishable things. <br />
  The Children of the unembodied Gleam <br />
  Arisen from a formless thought in the soul <br />
  And chased by an imperishable desire, <br />
  Traversed the field of the pursuing gaze. <br />
  A Will that unpersisting failed, worked there: <br />
  Life was a search but finding never came.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">There nothing satisfied, but all allured, <br />
  Things seemed to be that never wholly are, <br />
  Images were seen that looked like living acts <br />
  And symbols hid the sense they claimed to show, <br />
  Pale dreams grew real to the dreamer&#8217;s eyes. <br />
  The souls came there that vainly strive for birth, <br />
  And spirits entrapped might wander through all time, <br />
  Yet never find the truth by which they live. <br />
  All ran like hopes that hunt a lurking chance; <br />
  Nothing was solid, nothing felt complete: <br />
  All was unsafe, miraculous and half-true. <br />
  It seemed a realm of lives that had no base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then dawned a greater seeking, broadened sky, <br />
  A journey under wings of brooding Force. <br />
  First came the kingdom of the morning star: <br />
  A twilight beauty trembled under its spear <br />
  And the throb of promise of a wider Life. <br />
  Then slowly rose a great and doubting sun <br />
  And in its light she made of self a world. <br />
  A spirit was there that sought for its own deep self, <br />
  Yet was content with fragments pushed in front <br />
  And parts of living that belied the whole <br />
  But, pieced together, might one day be true. <br />
  Yet something seemed to be achieved at last. <br />
  A growing volume of the will-to-be, <br />
  A text of living and a graph of force, <br />
  A script of acts, a song of conscious forms <br />
  Burdened with meanings fugitive from thought&#8217;s grasp <br />
  And crowded with undertones of life&#8217;s rhythmic cry, <br />
  Could write itself on the hearts of living things. <br />
  In an outbreak of the might of secret Spirit, <br />
  In Life and Matter&#8217;s answer of delight, <br />
  Some face of deathless beauty could be caught <br />
  That gave immortality to a moment&#8217;s joy, <br />
  Some word that could incarnate highest Truth</p>

<p>Leaped out from a chance tension of the soul, <br />
  Some hue of the Absolute could fall on life, <br />
  Some glory of knowledge and intuitive sight, <br />
  Some passion of the rapturous heart of Love. <br />
  A hierophant of the bodiless Secrecy <br />
  Interned in an unseen spiritual sheath, <br />
  The Will that pushes sense beyond its scope <br />
  To feel the light and joy intangible, <br />

  Half manifested veiled Reality. <br />

  Illumined by a vision in the thought, <br />
  Upbuoyed by the heart&#8217;s understanding flame, <br />
  It could hold in the conscious ether of the spirit <br />
  The divinity of a symbol universe. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; This realm inspires us with our vaster hopes; <br />
  Its forces have made landings on our globe, <br />
  Its signs have traced their pattern in our lives: <br />
  It lends a sovereign movement to our fate, <br />
  Its errant waves motive our life&#8217;s high surge. <br />
  All that we seek for is prefigured there <br />
  And all we have not known nor ever sought <br />
  Which yet one day must be born in human hearts <br />
  That the Timeless may fulfil itself in things. <br />
  Incarnate in the mystery of the days, <br />
  Eternal in an unclosed Infinite, <br />
  A mounting endless possibility <br />
  Climbs high upon a topless ladder of dream <br />
  For ever in the Being&#8217;s conscious trance. <br />
  All on that ladder mounts to an unseen end. <br />
  An Energy of perpetual transience makes <br />
  The journey from which no return is sure, <br />
  The pilgrimage of Nature to the Unknown.</p>

  She hoped to unroll all that could ever be, <br />

  A progress leap from sight to greater sight, <br />
  A process march from form to ampler form, <br />
  A caravan of the inexhaustible <br />
  Formations of a boundless Thought and Force. <br />
  Her timeless Power that lay once on the lap <br />
  Of a beginningless and endless Calm, <br />
  Now severed from the Spirit&#8217;s immortal bliss, <br />
  Erects the type of all the joys she has lost; <br />
  Compelling transient substance into shape, <br />
  She hopes by the creative act&#8217;s release <br />
  To o&#8217;erleap sometimes the gulf she cannot fill, <br />
  To heal awhile the wound of severance, <br />
  Escape from the moment&#8217;s prison of littleness <br />
  And meet the Eternal&#8217;s wide sublimities <br />
  In the uncertain time-field portioned here. <br />
  Almost she nears what never can be attained; <br />
  She shuts eternity into an hour <br />
  And fills a little soul with the Infinite; <br />
  The Immobile leans to the magic of her call; <br />
  She stands on a shore in the Illimitable, <br />
  Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms <br />
  And feels around her infinity&#8217;s embrace. <br />
  Her task no ending knows; she serves no aim <br />
  But labours driven by a nameless Will <br />
  That came from some unknowable formless Vast. <br />
  This is her secret and impossible task <br />
  To catch the boundless in a net of birth, <br />
  To cast the spirit into physical form, <br />
  To lend speech and thought to the Ineffable; <br />
  She is pushed to reveal the ever Unmanifest. <br />
  Yet by her skill the impossible has been done: <br />
  She follows her sublime irrational plan, <br />
  Invents devices of her magic art</p>

<p>To find new bodies for the Infinite <br />
  And images of the Unimaginable; <br />
  She has lured the Eternal into the arms of Time. <br />
  Even now herself she knows not what she has done. <br />
  For all is wrought beneath a baffling mask: <br />
  A semblance other than its hidden truth <br />
  The aspect wears of an illusion&#8217;s trick, <br />
  A feigned time-driven unreality, <br />
  The unfinished creation of a changing soul <br />
  In a body changing with the inhabitant. <br />
  Insignificant her means, infinite her work; <br />
  On a great field of shapeless consciousness <br />
  In little finite strokes of mind and sense <br />
  An endless Truth she endlessly unfolds; <br />
  A timeless mystery works out in Time. <br />
  The greatness she has dreamed her acts have missed, <br />
  Her labour is a passion and a pain, <br />
  A rapture and pang, her glory and her curse; <br />
  And yet she cannot choose but labours on; <br />
  Her mighty heart forbids her to desist. <br />
  As long as the world lasts her failure lives <br />
  Astonishing and foiling Reason&#8217;s gaze, <br />
  A folly and a beauty unspeakable, <br />
  A superb madness of the will to live, <br />
  A daring, a delirium of delight. <br />
  This is her being&#8217;s law, its sole resource; <br />
  She sates, though satisfaction never comes, <br />
  Her hungry will to lavish everywhere <br />
  Her many-imaged fictions of the Self <br />
  And thousand fashions of one Reality. <br />
  A world she made touched by truth&#8217;s fleeing hem, <br />
  A world cast into a dream of what it seeks, <br />
  An icon of truth, a conscious mystery&#8217;s shape. <br />
  It lingered not like the earth-mind hemmed in <br />
  In solid barriers of apparent fact; <br />
  It dared to trust the dream-mind and the soul.</p>

<p>A hunter of spiritual verities <br />
  Still only thought or guessed or held by faith, <br />
  It seized in imagination and confined <br />
  A painted bird of paradise in a cage. <br />
  This greater life is enamoured of the Unseen; <br />
  It calls to some highest Light beyond its reach, <br />
  It can feel the Silence that absolves the soul; <br />
  It feels a saviour touch, a ray divine: <br />
  Beauty and good and truth its godheads are. <br />
  It is near to heavenlier heavens than earth&#8217;s eyes see, <br />
  A direr darkness than man&#8217;s life can bear: <br />
  It has kinship with the demon and the god. <br />
  A strange enthusiasm has moved its heart; <br />
  It hungers for heights, it passions for the supreme. <br />
  It hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape, <br />
  It leaps to the summit thought, the summit light. <br />
  For by the form the Formless is brought close <br />
  And all perfection fringes the Absolute. <br />
  A child of heaven who never saw his home, <br />
  Its impetus meets the eternal at a point: <br />
  It can only near and touch, it cannot hold; <br />
  It can only strain towards some bright extreme: <br />
  Its greatness is to seek and to create. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On every plane, this Greatness must create. <br />
  On earth, in heaven, in hell she is the same; <br />
  Of every fate she takes her mighty part. <br />
  A guardian of the fire that lights the suns, <br />
  She triumphs in her glory and her might: <br />
  Opposed, oppressed she bears God&#8217;s urge to be born: <br />
  The spirit survives upon non-being&#8217;s ground, <br />
  World-force outlasts world-disillusion&#8217;s shock: <br />
  Dumb, she is still the Word, inert the Power. <br />
  Here fallen, a slave of death and ignorance, <br />
  To things deathless she is driven to aspire <br />
  And moved to know even the Unknowable. <br />
  Even nescient, null, her sleep creates a world.</p>

  In death, her bed, she waits the hour to rise. <br />

  She carries crucified God upon her breast. <br />
  In chill insentient depths where joy is none, <br />
  Immured, oppressed by the resisting Void <br />
  Where nothing moves and nothing can become, <br />
  Still she remembers, still invokes the skill <br />

  Reveals a world where nothing was before. <br />
  In realms confined to a prone circle of death, <br />
  To a dark eternity of Ignorance, <br />
  A quiver in an inert inconscient mass, <br />
  Or imprisoned in immobilised whorls of Force, <br />
  By Matter&#8217;s blind compulsion deaf and mute <br />
  She refuses motionless in the dust to sleep. <br />
  Then, for her rebel waking&#8217;s punishment <br />
  Given only hard mechanic Circumstance <br />
  As the enginery of her magic craft, <br />
  She fashions godlike marvels out of mud; <br />
  In the plasm she sets her dumb immortal urge, <br />
  Helps the live tissue to think, the closed sense to feel, <br />
  Flashes through the frail nerves poignant messages, <br />
  In a heart of flesh miraculously loves,</p>

  Ever she summons as by a sorcerer&#8217;s wand <br />
  Beings and shapes and scenes innumerable, <br />
  Torch-bearers of her pomps through Time and Space. <br />
  This world is her long journey through the night, <br />
  The suns and planets lamps to light her road, <br />
  Our reason is the confidante of her thoughts, <br />

  There drawing her signs from things half true, half false, <br />

  The memory of her lost eternity. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are her deeds in this huge world-ignorance: <br />
  Till the veil is lifted, till the night is dead, <br />
  In light or dark she keeps her tireless search; <br />
  Time is her road of endless pilgrimage. <br />
  One mighty passion motives all her works. <br />
  Her eternal Lover is her action&#8217;s cause; <br />
  For him she leaped forth from the unseen Vasts <br />
  To move here in a stark unconscious world. <br />
  Its acts are her commerce with her hidden Guest, <br />
  His moods she takes for her heart&#8217;s passionate moulds; <br />

  Ashamed of her rich cosmic poverty, <br />

  Holds with her scenes his look&#8217;s fidelity <br />
  And woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell <br />
  In figures of her million-impulsed Force. <br />
  Only to attract her veiled companion <br />
  And keep him close to her breast in her world-cloak <br />
  Lest from her arms he turn to his formless peace, <br />
  Is her heart&#8217;s business and her clinging care. <br />
  Yet when he is most near, she feels him far. <br />
  For contradiction is her nature&#8217;s law. <br />
  Although she is ever in him and he in her, <br />
  As if unaware of the eternal tie, <br />
  Her will is to shut God into her works</p>

  A sumptuous chamber of the spirit&#8217;s sleep <br />

  Passes a glint of unseen deity. <br />
  Across a luminous dream of spirit-space <br />
  She builds creation like a rainbow bridge <br />

  A net is made of the mobile universe; <br />

  Explained, they seem yet more inexplicable. <br />

  There the enigma shows its splendid prism, <br />
  There is no deep disguise of commonness; <br />
  Occult, profound comes all experience, <br />
  Marvel is ever new, miracle divine. <br />
  There is a screened burden, a mysterious touch, <br />
  There is a secrecy of hidden sense. <br />
  Although no earthen mask weighs on her face, <br />
  Into herself she flees from her own sight. <br />
  All forms are tokens of some veiled idea</p>

<p>Left quivering the subtle body&#8217;s frame, <br />
  Their anger rushed galloping in brute attack, <br />
  A charge of trampling hooves on shaken soil; <br />
  One felt another&#8217;s grief invade the breast, <br />
  Another&#8217;s joy exulting ran through the blood: <br />
  Hearts could draw close through distance, voices near <br />
  That spoke upon the shore of alien seas. <br />
  There beat a throb of living interchange: <br />
  Being felt being even when afar <br />
  And consciousness replied to consciousness. <br />
  And yet the ultimate oneness was not there. <br />
  There was a separateness of soul from soul: <br />
  An inner wall of silence could be built, <br />
  An armour of conscious might protect and shield; <br />
  The being could be closed in and solitary; <br />
  One could remain apart in self, alone. <br />
  Identity was not yet nor union&#8217;s peace. <br />
  All was imperfect still, half-known, half-done: <br />
  The miracle of Inconscience overpassed, <br />
  The miracle of the Superconscient still, <br />
  Unknown, self-wrapped, unfelt, unknowable, <br />
  Looked down on them, origin of all they were. <br />
  As forms they came of the formless Infinite, <br />
  As names lived of a nameless Eternity. <br />
  The beginning and the end were there occult; <br />
  A middle term worked unexplained, abrupt: <br />
  They were words that spoke to a vast wordless Truth, <br />
  They were figures crowding an unfinished sum. <br />
  None truly knew himself or knew the world <br />
  Or the Reality living there enshrined: <br />
  Only they knew what Mind could take and build <br />
  Out of the secret Supermind&#8217;s huge store. <br />
  A darkness under them, a bright Void above, <br />
  Uncertain they lived in a great climbing Space; <br />
  By mysteries they explained a Mystery, <br />
  A riddling answer met the riddle of things.</p>

  Himself was soon a riddle to himself; <br />
  As symbols he saw all and sought their sense. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the leaping springs of death and birth <br />
  And over shifting borders of soul-change, <br />
  A hunter on the spirit&#8217;s creative track, <br />
  He followed in life&#8217;s fine and mighty trails <br />
  Pursuing her sealed formidable delight <br />
  In a perilous adventure without close. <br />
  At first no aim appeared in those large steps: <br />
  Only the wide source he saw of all things here <br />
  Looking towards a wider source beyond. <br />
  For as she drew away from earthly lines, <br />
  A tenser drag was felt from the Unknown, <br />
  A higher context of delivering thought <br />
  Drove her towards marvel and discovery; <br />
  There came a high release from pettier cares, <br />
  A mightier image of desire and hope, <br />
  A vaster formula, a greater scene. <br />
  Ever she circled towards some far-off Light: <br />
  Her signs still covered more than they revealed; <br />
  But tied to some immediate sight and will <br />
  They lost their purport in the joy of use, <br />
  Till stripped of their infinite meaning they became <br />
  A cipher gleaming with unreal sense. <br />
  Armed with a magical and haunted bow <br />
  She aimed at a target kept invisible <br />
  And ever deemed remote though always near. <br />
  As one who spells illumined characters, <br />
  The key-book of a crabbed magician text, <br />
  He scanned her subtle tangled weird designs <br />
  And the screened difficult theorem of her clues, <br />
  Traced in the monstrous sands of desert Time <br />
  The thread beginnings of her titan works, <br />
  Watched her charade of action for some hint,</p>

  As if sitting near an open window&#8217;s gap, <br />

  Chapters of her metaphysical romance <br />
  Of the soul&#8217;s search for lost Reality <br />
  And her fictions drawn from spirit&#8217;s authentic fact, <br />
  Her caprices and conceits and meanings locked, <br />
  Her rash unseizable freaks and mysteried turns. <br />

  The strange significant forms woven on her robe, <br />
  Her meaningful outlines of the souls of things <br />

  Her rich brocades with imaged fancies sewn <br />
  And mutable masks and broideries of disguise. <br />
  A thousand baffling faces of the Truth <br />
  Looked at him from her forms with unknown eyes <br />
  And wordless mouths unrecognisable, <br />
  Spoke from the figures of her masquerade, <br />
  Or peered from the recondite magnificence <br />

<p>In sudden scintillations of the Unknown, <br />
  Inexpressive sounds became veridical, <br />
  Ideas that seemed unmeaning flashed out truth; <br />
  Voices that came from unseen waiting worlds <br />
  Uttered the syllables of the Unmanifest <br />
  To clothe the body of the mystic Word, <br />
  And wizard diagrams of the occult Law <br />
  Sealed some precise unreadable harmony, <br />

  In her covert lanes, bordering her chance field-paths <br />
  And by her singing rivulets and calm lakes <br />
  He found the glow of her golden fruits of bliss <br />
  And the beauty of her flowers of dream and muse. <br />
  As if a miracle of heart&#8217;s change by joy <br />

  The crimson outburst of one secular flower <br />
  On the tree-of-sacrifice of spiritual love. <br />
  In the sleepy splendour of her noons he saw, <br />

  Running as if to escape from longed-for hands, <br />
  Jingling sweet anklet-bells of fantasy. <br />
  Amidst live symbols of her occult power <br />
  He moved and felt them as close real forms: <br />
  In that life more concrete than the lives of men <br />
  Throbbed heart-beats of the hidden reality: <br />
  Embodied was there what we but think and feel, <br />
  Self-framed what here takes outward borrowed shapes. <br />

  He stood with her on meditating peaks <br />
  Where life and being are a sacrament <br />
  Offered to the Reality beyond, <br />
  And saw her loose into infinity <br />
  Her hooded eagles of significance, <br />
  Messengers of Thought to the Unknowable. <br />
  Identified in soul-vision and soul-sense, <br />
  Entering into her depths as into a house, <br />
  All he became that she was or longed to be, <br />
  He thought with her thoughts and journeyed with her steps, <br />
  Lived with her breath and scanned all with her eyes <br />
  That so he might learn the secret of her soul. <br />
  A witness overmastered by his scene, <br />
  He admired her splendid front of pomp and play <br />
  And the marvels of her rich and delicate craft, <br />
  And thrilled to the insistence of her cry; <br />
  Impassioned he bore the sorceries of her might, <br />
  Felt laid on him her abrupt mysterious will, <br />
  Her hands that knead fate in their violent grasp, <br />
  Her touch that moves, her powers that seize and drive. <br />
  But this too he saw, her soul that wept within, <br />
  Her seekings vain that clutch at fleeing truth, <br />
  Her hopes whose sombre gaze mates with despair, <br />
  The passion that possessed her longing limbs, <br />
  The trouble and rapture of her yearning breasts, <br />
  Her mind that toils unsatisfied with its fruits, <br />
  Her heart that captures not the one Beloved. <br />
  Always he met a veiled and seeking Force, <br />
  An exiled goddess building mimic heavens, <br />
  A Sphinx whose eyes look up to a hidden Sun. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever he felt near a spirit in her forms: <br />
  Its passive presence was her nature&#8217;s strength; <br />

  Its stamp on her acts is undiscoverable. <br />
  A pathos of lost heights is its appeal. <br />
  Only sometimes is caught a shadowy line <br />
  That seems a hint of veiled reality. <br />
  Life stared at him with vague confused outlines <br />
  Offering a picture the eyes could not keep, <br />
  A story that was yet not written there. <br />
  As in a fragmentary half-lost design <br />

  Life&#8217;s visage hides life&#8217;s real self from sight; <br />
  Life&#8217;s secret sense is written within, above. <br />
  The thought that gives it sense lives far beyond; <br />
  It is not seen in its half-finished design. <br />
  In vain we hope to read the baffling signs <br />
  Or find the word of the half-played charade. <br />
  Only in that greater life a cryptic thought <br />
  Is found, is hinted some interpreting word <br />
  That makes the earth-myth a tale intelligible. <br />
  Something was seen at last that looked like truth. <br />
  In a half-lit air of hazardous mystery <br />
  The eye that looks at the dark half of truth <br />
  Made out an image mid a vivid blur <br />
  And peering through a mist of subtle tints <br />
  He saw a half-blind chained divinity <br />
  Bewildered by the world in which he moved, <br />
  Yet conscious of some light prompting his soul. <br />
  Attracted to strange far-off shimmerings, <br />
  Led by the fluting of a distant Player <br />
  He sought his way amid life&#8217;s laughter and call <br />
  And the index chaos of her myriad steps <br />
  Towards some total deep infinitude. <br />
  Around crowded the forest of her signs: <br />
  At hazard he read by arrow-leaps of Thought <br />
  That hit the mark by guess or luminous chance, <br />
  Her changing coloured road-lights of idea</p>

  And her landmarks in the tangled paths of Time. <br />
  In her mazes of approach and of retreat <br />
  To every side she draws him and repels, <br />

  Hieratic key to unknown beatitudes. <br />

  A delicate weft of sorcery steals the heart <br />

  Yet they but wake a thrill of transient grace; <br />
  A vagrant march struck by the wanderer Time, <br />
  They call to a brief unsatisfied delight <br />
  Or wallow in ravishments of mind and sense, <br />
  But miss the luminous answer of the soul. <br />
  A blind heart-throb that reaches joy through tears, <br />
  A yearning towards peaks for ever unreached, <br />
  An ecstasy of unfulfilled desire <br />
  Track the last heavenward climbings of her voice. <br />

  Her sorrow into a magic crown of song. <br />
  Brief are her snatches of felicity <br />
  That touch the surface, then escape or die: <br />
  A lost remembrance echoes in her depths, <br />
  A deathless longing is hers, a veiled self&#8217;s call; <br />

  A fateful hand has touched the cosmic chords <br />
  And the intrusion of a troubled strain <br />
  Covers the inner music&#8217;s hidden key <br />
  That guides unheard the surface cadences. <br />
  Yet is it joy to live and to create <br />
  And joy to love and labour though all fails, <br />
  And joy to seek though all we find deceives <br />
  And all on which we lean betrays our trust; <br />
  Yet something in its depths was worth the pain, <br />
  A passionate memory haunts with ecstasy&#8217;s fire. <br />
  Even grief has joy hidden beneath its roots: <br />
  For nothing is truly vain the One has made: <br />
  In our defeated hearts God&#8217;s strength survives <br />
  And victory&#8217;s star still lights our desperate road; <br />
  Our death is made a passage to new worlds. <br />
  This to Life&#8217;s music gives its anthem swell. <br />

  No silent peak is found where Time can rest. <br />
  This was a magic stream that reached no sea. <br />
  However far he went, wherever turned, <br />
  The wheel of works ran with him and outstripped; <br />
  Always a farther task was left to do. <br />
  A beat of action and a cry of search <br />
  For ever grew in that unquiet world; <br />
  A busy murmur filled the heart of Time. <br />
  All was contrivance and unceasing stir. <br />
  A hundred ways to live were tried in vain: <br />
  A sameness that assumed a thousand forms <br />
  Strove to escape from its long monotone <br />
  And made new things that soon were like the old. <br />
  A curious decoration lured the eye <br />
  And novel values furbished ancient themes <br />
  To cheat the mind with the idea of change. <br />
  A different picture that was still the same <br />
  Appeared upon the cosmic vague background. <br />
  Only another labyrinthine house <br />
  Of creatures and their doings and events, <br />
  A city of the traffic of bound souls,</p>

<p>A market of creation and her wares, <br />
  Was offered to the labouring mind and heart. <br />
  A circuit ending where it first began <br />
  Is dubbed the forward and eternal march <br />
  Of progress on perfection&#8217;s unknown road. <br />
  Each final scheme leads to a sequel plan. <br />
  Yet every new departure seems the last, <br />
  Inspired evangel, theory&#8217;s ultimate peak, <br />
  Proclaiming a panacea for all Time&#8217;s ills <br />
  Or carrying thought in its ultimate zenith flight <br />
  And trumpeting supreme discovery; <br />
  Each brief idea, a structure perishable, <br />
  Publishes the immortality of its rule, <br />
  Its claim to be the perfect form of things, <br />
  Truth&#8217;s last epitome, Time&#8217;s golden best. <br />
  But nothing has been achieved of infinite worth: <br />
  A world made ever anew, never complete, <br />
  Piled always half-attempts on lost attempts <br />
  And saw a fragment as the eternal Whole. <br />
  In the aimless mounting total of things done <br />
  Existence seemed a vain necessity&#8217;s act, <br />
  A wrestle of eternal opposites <br />
  In a clasped antagonism&#8217;s close-locked embrace, <br />
  A play without denouement or idea, <br />
  A hunger march of lives without a goal, <br />
  Or, written on a bare blackboard of Space, <br />
  A futile and recurring sum of souls, <br />
  A hope that failed, a light that never shone, <br />
  The labour of an unaccomplished Force <br />
  Tied to its acts in a dim eternity. <br />
  There is no end or none can yet be seen: <br />
  Although defeated, life must struggle on; <br />
  Always she sees a crown she cannot grasp; <br />
  Her eyes are fixed beyond her fallen state. <br />
  There quivers still within her breast and ours <br />
  A glory that was once and is no more,</p>

<p>Or there calls to us from some unfulfilled beyond <br />
  A greatness yet unreached by the halting world. <br />
  In a memory behind our mortal sense <br />
  A dream persists of larger happier air <br />
  Breathing around free hearts of joy and love, <br />
  Forgotten by us, immortal in lost Time. <br />
  A ghost of bliss pursues her haunted depths; <br />
  For she remembers still, though now so far, <br />
  Her realm of golden ease and glad desire <br />
  And the beauty and strength and happiness that were hers <br />
  In the sweetness of her glowing paradise, <br />
  In her kingdom of immortal ecstasy <br />
  Half-way between God&#8217;s silence and the Abyss. <br />
  This knowledge in our hidden parts we keep; <br />
  Awake to a vague mystery&#8217;s appeal, <br />
  We meet a deep unseen Reality <br />
  Far truer than the world&#8217;s face of present truth: <br />
  We are chased by a self we cannot now recall <br />
  And moved by a Spirit we must still become. <br />
  As one who has lost the kingdom of his soul, <br />
  We look back to some god-phase of our birth <br />
  Other than this imperfect creature here <br />
  And hope in this or a diviner world <br />
  To recover yet from Heaven&#8217;s patient guard <br />
  What by our mind&#8217;s forgetfulness we miss, <br />
  Our being&#8217;s natural felicity, <br />
  Our heart&#8217;s delight we have exchanged for grief, <br />
  The body&#8217;s thrill we bartered for mere pain, <br />
  The bliss for which our mortal nature yearns <br />
  As yearns an obscure moth to blazing Light. <br />
  Our life is a march to a victory never won. <br />
  This wave of being longing for delight, <br />
  This eager turmoil of unsatisfied strengths, <br />
  These long far files of forward-striving hopes <br />
  Lift worshipping eyes to the blue Void called heaven <br />
  Looking for the golden Hand that never came,</p>

<p>The advent for which all creation waits, <br />
  The beautiful visage of Eternity <br />
  That shall appear upon the roads of Time. <br />
  Yet still to ourselves we say rekindling faith, <br />
  &#8220;Oh, surely one day he shall come to our cry, <br />
  One day he shall create our life anew <br />
  And utter the magic formula of peace <br />
  And bring perfection to the scheme of things. <br />
  One day he shall descend to life and earth, <br />
  Leaving the secrecy of the eternal doors, <br />
  Into a world that cries to him for help, <br />
  And bring the truth that sets the spirit free, <br />
  The joy that is the baptism of the soul, <br />
  The strength that is the outstretched arm of Love. <br />
  One day he shall lift his beauty&#8217;s dreadful veil, <br />
  Impose delight on the world&#8217;s beating heart <br />
  And bare his secret body of light and bliss.&#8221; <br />
  But now we strain to reach an unknown goal: <br />
  There is no end of seeking and of birth, <br />
  There is no end of dying and return; <br />
  The life that wins its aim asks greater aims, <br />
  The life that fails and dies must live again; <br />
  Till it has found itself it cannot cease. <br />
  All must be done for which life and death were made. <br />
  But who shall say that even then is rest? <br />
  Or there repose and action are the same <br />
  In the deep breast of God&#8217;s supreme delight. <br />
  In a high state where ignorance is no more, <br />
  Each movement is a wave of peace and bliss, <br />
  Repose God&#8217;s motionless creative force, <br />
  Action a ripple in the Infinite <br />
  And birth a gesture of Eternity. <br />
  A sun of transfiguration still can shine <br />
  And Night can bare its core of mystic light; <br />
  The self-cancelling, self-afflicting paradox <br />
  Into a self-luminous mystery might change,</p>

  Then God could be visible here, here take a shape; <br />
  Disclosed would be the spirit&#8217;s identity; <br />
  Life would reveal her true immortal face. <br />
  But now a termless labour is her fate: <br />
  In its recurrent decimal of events <br />
  Birth, death are a ceaseless iteration&#8217;s points; <br />
  The old question-mark margins each finished page, <br />
  Each volume of her effort&#8217;s history. <br />
  A limping Yes through the aeons journeys still <br />
  Accompanied by an eternal No. <br />
  All seems in vain, yet endless is the game. <br />
  Impassive turns the ever-circling Wheel, <br />
  Life has no issue, death brings no release. <br />
  A prisoner of itself the being lives <br />
  And keeps its futile immortality; <br />
  Extinction is denied, its sole escape. <br />
  An error of the gods has made the world. <br />
  Or indifferent the Eternal watches Time. </p>
