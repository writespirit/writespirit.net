<p>This too must now be overpassed and left, <br />
  As all must be until the Highest is gained <br />
  In whom the world and self grow true and one: <br />
  Till That is reached our journeying cannot cease. <br />
  Always a nameless goal beckons beyond, <br />
  Always ascends the zigzag of the gods <br />
  And upward points the spirit&#8217;s climbing Fire. <br />
  This breath of hundred-hued felicity <br />
  And its pure heightened figure of Time&#8217;s joy, <br />
  Tossed upon waves of flawless happiness, <br />
  Hammered into single beats of ecstasy, <br />
  This fraction of the spirit&#8217;s integer <br />
  Caught into a passionate greatness of extremes, <br />
  This limited being lifted to zenith bliss, <br />
  Happy to enjoy one touch of things supreme, <br />
  Packed into its sealed small infinity, <br />
  Its endless time-made world outfacing Time, <br />
  A little output of God&#8217;s vast delight. <br />
  The moments stretched towards the eternal Now, <br />
  The hours discovered immortality, <br />
  But, satisfied with their sublime contents, <br />
  On peaks they ceased whose tops half-way to Heaven <br />
  Pointed to an apex they could never mount, <br />
  To a grandeur in whose air they could not live. <br />
  Inviting to their high and exquisite sphere, <br />
  To their secure and fine extremities <br />
  This creature who hugs his limits to feel safe, <br />
  These heights declined a greater adventure&#8217;s call. <br />
  A glory and sweetness of satisfied desire <br />
  Tied up the spirit to golden posts of bliss. <br />
  It could not house the wideness of a soul</p>

<p>Which needed all infinity for its home. <br />
  A memory soft as grass and faint as sleep, <br />
  The beauty and call receding sank behind <br />
  Like a sweet song heard fading far away <br />
  Upon the long high road to Timelessness. <br />
  Above was an ardent white tranquillity. <br />
  A musing spirit looked out on the worlds <br />
  And like a brilliant clambering of skies <br />
  Passing through clarity to an unseen Light <br />
  Large lucent realms of Mind from stillness shone. <br />
  But first he met a silver-grey expanse <br />
  Where Day and Night had wedded and were one: <br />
  It was a tract of dim and shifting rays <br />
  Parting Life&#8217;s sentient flow from Thought&#8217;s self-poise. <br />
  A coalition of uncertainties <br />
  There exercised uneasy government <br />
  On a ground reserved for doubt and reasoned guess, <br />
  A rendezvous of Knowledge with Ignorance. <br />
  At its low extremity held difficult sway <br />
  A mind that hardly saw and slowly found; <br />
  Its nature to our earthly nature close <br />
  And kin to our precarious mortal thought <br />
  That looks from soil to sky and sky to soil <br />
  But knows not the below nor the beyond, <br />
  It only sensed itself and outward things. <br />
  This was the first means of our slow ascent <br />
  From the half-conscience of the animal soul <br />
  Living in a crowded press of shape-events <br />
  In a realm it cannot understand nor change; <br />
  Only it sees and acts in a given scene <br />
  And feels and joys and sorrows for a while. <br />
  The ideas that drive the obscure embodied spirit <br />
  Along the roads of suffering and desire <br />
  In a world that struggles to discover Truth, <br />
  Found here their power to be and Nature-force. <br />
  Here are devised the forms of an ignorant life</p>

<p>That sees the empiric fact as settled law, <br />
  Labours for the hour and not for eternity <br />
  And trades its gains to meet the moment&#8217;s call: <br />
  The slow process of a material mind <br />
  Which serves the body it should rule and use <br />
  And needs to lean upon an erring sense, <br />
  Was born in that luminous obscurity. <br />
  Advancing tardily from a limping start, <br />
  Crutching hypothesis on argument, <br />
  Throning its theories as certitudes, <br />
  It reasons from the half-known to the unknown, <br />
  Ever constructing its frail house of thought, <br />
  Ever undoing the web that it has spun. <br />
  A twilight sage whose shadow seems to him self, <br />
  Moving from minute to brief minute lives; <br />
  A king dependent on his satellites <br />
  Signs the decrees of ignorant ministers, <br />
  A judge in half-possession of his proofs, <br />
  A voice clamant of uncertainty&#8217;s postulates, <br />
  An architect of knowledge, not its source. <br />
  This powerful bondslave of his instruments <br />
  Thinks his low station Nature&#8217;s highest top, <br />
  Oblivious of his share in all things made <br />
  And haughtily humble in his own conceit <br />
  Believes himself a spawn of Matter&#8217;s mud <br />
  And takes his own creations for his cause. <br />
  To eternal light and knowledge meant to rise, <br />
  Up from man&#8217;s bare beginning is our climb; <br />
  Out of earth&#8217;s heavy smallness we must break, <br />
  We must search our nature with spiritual fire: <br />
  An insect crawl preludes our glorious flight; <br />
  Our human state cradles the future god, <br />
  Our mortal frailty an immortal force. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; At the glow-worm top of these pale glimmer-realms <br />
  Where dawn-sheen gambolled with the native dusk <br />
  And helped the Day to grow and Night to fail,</p>

<p>Escaping over a wide and shimmering bridge, <br />
  He came into a realm of early Light <br />
  And the regency of a half-risen sun. <br />
  Out of its rays our mind&#8217;s full orb was born. <br />
  Appointed by the Spirit of the Worlds <br />
  To mediate with the unknowing depths, <br />
  A prototypal deft Intelligence <br />
  Half-poised on equal wings of thought and doubt <br />
  Toiled ceaselessly twixt being&#8217;s hidden ends. <br />
  A Secrecy breathed in life&#8217;s moving act; <br />
  A covert nurse of Nature&#8217;s miracles, <br />

  A master Magician of measure and device <br />
  Has made an eternity from recurring forms <br />
  And to the wandering spectator thought <br />
  Assigned a seat on the inconscient stage. <br />
  On earth by the will of this Arch-Intelligence <br />
  A bodiless energy put on Matter&#8217;s robe; <br />
  Proton and photon served the imager Eye <br />
  To change things subtle into a physical world <br />
  And the invisible appeared as shape <br />
  And the impalpable was felt as mass: <br />
  Magic of percept joined with concept&#8217;s art <br />
  And lent to each object an interpreting name: <br />
  Idea was disguised in a body&#8217;s artistry, <br />
  And by a strange atomic law&#8217;s mystique <br />
  A frame was made in which the sense could put <br />
  Its symbol picture of the universe. <br />
  Even a greater miracle was done. <br />
  The mediating light linked body&#8217;s power, <br />
  The sleep and dreaming of the tree and plant, <br />
  The animal&#8217;s vibrant sense, the thought in man, <br />
  To the effulgence of a Ray above. <br />
  Its skill endorsing Matter&#8217;s right to think</p>

  Offering its little squares and cubes of word <br />
  As figured substitutes for reality, <br />
  A mummified mnemonic alphabet, <br />

  None the true body found, its soul seemed dead: <br />
  None had the inner look which sees Truth&#8217;s whole; <br />
  All glorified the glittering substitute. <br />
  Then from the secret heights a wave swept down, <br />
  A brilliant chaos of rebel light arose; <br />
  It looked above and saw the dazzling peaks, <br />
  It looked within and woke the sleeping god. <br />
  Imagination called her shining squads <br />
  That venture into undiscovered scenes <br />
  Where all the marvels lurk none yet has known: <br />
  Lifting her beautiful and miraculous head, <br />
  She conspired with inspiration&#8217;s sister brood <br />
  To fill thought&#8217;s skies with glimmering nebulae. <br />
  A bright Error fringed the mystery-altar&#8217;s frieze; <br />
  Darkness grew nurse to wisdom&#8217;s occult sun, <br />
  Myth suckled knowledge with her lustrous milk;</p>

  Nourishing its immature divinity <br />

  Made of the sands upon a bank of Time <br />

  Arousing knowledge from its sleepy lair. <br />
  For knowledge comes not to us as a guest <br />
  Called into our chamber from the outer world; <br />
  A friend and inmate of our secret self, <br />
  It hid behind our minds and fell asleep <br />
  And slowly wakes beneath the blows of life; <br />
  The mighty daemon lies unshaped within, <br />
  To evoke, to give it form is Nature&#8217;s task. <br />
  All was a chaos of the true and false, <br />
  Mind sought amid deep mists of Nescience; <br />
  It looked within itself but saw not God. <br />
  A material interim diplomacy <br />
  Denied the Truth that transient truths might live <br />
  And hid the Deity in creed and guess <br />
  That the World-Ignorance might grow slowly wise. <br />
  This was the imbroglio made by sovereign Mind <br />
  Looking from a gleam-ridge into the Night <br />
  In her first tamperings with Inconscience: <br />
  Its alien dusk baffles her luminous eyes; <br />
  Her rapid hands must learn a cautious zeal; <br />
  Only a slow advance the earth can bear. <br />
  Yet was her strength unlike the unseeing earth&#8217;s <br />
  Compelled to handle makeshift instruments <br />
  Invented by the life-force and the flesh. <br />
  Earth all perceives through doubtful images, <br />
  All she conceives in hazardous jets of sight, <br />
  Small lights kindled by touches of groping thought. <br />
  Incapable of the soul&#8217;s direct inlook <br />
  She sees by spasms and solders knowledge-scrap, <br />
  Makes Truth the slave-girl of her indigence, <br />
  Expelling Nature&#8217;s mystic unity <br />
  Cuts into quantum and mass the moving All; <br />
  She takes for measuring-rod her ignorance. <br />

  To the dangerous joy of wideness and of height. <br />

<p>Her thought is an endless march without a goal. <br />
  There is no summit on which she can stand <br />
  And see in a single glance the Infinite&#8217;s whole. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; An inconclusive play is Reason&#8217;s toil. <br />
  Each strong idea can use her as its tool; <br />
  Accepting every brief she pleads her case. <br />
  Open to every thought, she cannot know. <br />
  The eternal Advocate seated as judge <br />
  Armours in logic&#8217;s invulnerable mail <br />
  A thousand combatants for Truth&#8217;s veiled throne <br />
  And sets on a high horse-back of argument <br />
  To tilt for ever with a wordy lance <br />
  In a mock tournament where none can win. <br />
  Assaying thought&#8217;s values with her rigid tests <br />
  Balanced she sits on wide and empty air, <br />
  Aloof and pure in her impartial poise. <br />
  Absolute her judgments seem but none is sure; <br />
  Time cancels all her verdicts in appeal. <br />
  Although like sunbeams to our glow-worm mind <br />
  Her knowledge feigns to fall from a clear heaven, <br />
  Its rays are a lantern&#8217;s lustres in the Night; <br />
  She throws a glittering robe on Ignorance. <br />
  But now is lost her ancient sovereign claim <br />
  To rule mind&#8217;s high realm in her absolute right, <br />
  Bind thought with logic&#8217;s forged infallible chain <br />
  Or see truth nude in a bright abstract haze. <br />
  A master and slave of stark phenomenon, <br />
  She travels on the roads of erring sight <br />
  Or looks upon a set mechanical world <br />
  Constructed for her by her instruments. <br />
  A bullock yoked in the cart of proven fact, <br />
  She drags huge knowledge-bales through Matter&#8217;s dust <br />
  To reach utility&#8217;s immense bazaar. <br />
  Apprentice she has grown to her old drudge; <br />
  An aided sense is her seeking&#8217;s arbiter. <br />
  This now she uses as the assayer&#8217;s stone.</p>

<p>As if she knew not facts are husks of truth, <br />
  The husks she keeps, the kernel throws aside. <br />
  An ancient wisdom fades into the past, <br />
  The ages&#8217; faith becomes an idle tale, <br />
  God passes out of the awakened thought, <br />
  An old discarded dream needed no more: <br />
  Only she seeks mechanic Nature&#8217;s keys. <br />
  Interpreting stone-laws inevitable <br />
  She digs into Matter&#8217;s hard concealing soil, <br />
  To unearth the processes of all things done. <br />
  A loaded huge self-worked machine appears <br />
  To her eye&#8217;s eager and admiring stare, <br />
  An intricate and meaningless enginery <br />
  Of ordered fateful and unfailing Chance: <br />
  Ingenious and meticulous and minute, <br />
  Its brute unconscious accurate device <br />
  Unrolls an unerring march, maps a sure road; <br />
  It plans without thinking, acts without a will, <br />
  A million purposes serves with purpose none <br />
  And builds a rational world without a mind. <br />
  It has no mover, no maker, no idea: <br />
  Its vast self-action toils without a cause; <br />
  A lifeless Energy irresistibly driven, <br />
  Death&#8217;s head on the body of Necessity, <br />
  Engenders life and fathers consciousness, <br />
  Then wonders why all was and whence it came. <br />
  Our thoughts are parts of the immense machine, <br />
  Our ponderings but a freak of Matter&#8217;s law, <br />
  The mystic&#8217;s lore was a fancy or a blind; <br />
  Of soul or spirit we have now no need: <br />
  Matter is the admirable Reality, <br />
  The patent unescapable miracle, <br />
  The hard truth of things, simple, eternal, sole. <br />
  A suicidal rash expenditure <br />
  Creating the world by a mystery of self-loss <br />
  Has poured its scattered works on empty Space;</p>

<p>Late shall the self-disintegrating Force <br />
  Contract the immense expansion it has made: <br />
  Then ends this mighty and unmeaning toil, <br />
  The Void is left bare, vacant as before. <br />
  Thus vindicated, crowned, the grand new Thought <br />
  Explained the world and mastered all its laws, <br />
  Touched the dumb roots, woke veiled tremendous powers; <br />
  It bound to service the unconscious djinns <br />
  That sleep unused in Matter&#8217;s ignorant trance. <br />
  All was precise, rigid, indubitable. <br />
  But when on Matter&#8217;s rock of ages based <br />
  A whole stood up firm and clear-cut and safe, <br />
  All staggered back into a sea of doubt; <br />
  This solid scheme melted in endless flux: <br />
  She had met the formless Power inventor of forms; <br />
  Suddenly she stumbled upon things unseen: <br />
  A lightning from the undiscovered Truth <br />
  Startled her eyes with its perplexing glare <br />
  And dug a gulf between the Real and Known <br />
  Till all her knowledge seemed an ignorance. <br />
  Once more the world was made a wonder-web, <br />
  A magic&#8217;s process in a magical space, <br />
  An unintelligible miracle&#8217;s depths <br />
  Whose source is lost in the Ineffable. <br />
  Once more we face the blank Unknowable. <br />
  In a crash of values, in a huge doom-crack, <br />
  In the sputter and scatter of her breaking work <br />
  She lost her clear conserved constructed world. <br />
  A quantum dance remained, a sprawl of chance <br />
  In Energy&#8217;s stupendous tripping whirl: <br />
  A ceaseless motion in the unbounded Void <br />
  Invented forms without a thought or aim: <br />
  Necessity and Cause were shapeless ghosts; <br />
  Matter was an incident in being&#8217;s flow, <br />
  Law but a clock-work habit of blind force. <br />
  Ideals, ethics, systems had no base</p>

<p>And soon collapsed or without sanction lived; <br />
  All grew a chaos, a heave and clash and strife. <br />
  Ideas warring and fierce leaped upon life; <br />
  A hard compression held down anarchy <br />
  And liberty was only a phantom&#8217;s name: <br />
  Creation and destruction waltzed inarmed <br />
  On the bosom of a torn and quaking earth; <br />
  All reeled into a world of Kali&#8217;s dance. <br />
  Thus tumbled, sinking, sprawling in the Void, <br />
  Clutching for props, a soil on which to stand, <br />
  She only saw a thin atomic Vast, <br />
  The rare-point sparse substratum universe <br />
  On which floats a solid world&#8217;s phenomenal face. <br />
  Alone a process of events was there <br />
  And Nature&#8217;s plastic and protean change <br />
  And, strong by death to slay or to create, <br />
  The riven invisible atom&#8217;s omnipotent force. <br />
  One chance remained that here might be a power <br />
  To liberate man from the old inadequate means <br />
  And leave him sovereign of the earthly scene. <br />
  For Reason then might grasp the original Force <br />
  To drive her car upon the roads of Time. <br />
  All then might serve the need of the thinking race, <br />
  An absolute State found order&#8217;s absolute, <br />
  To a standardised perfection cut all things, <br />
  In society build a just exact machine. <br />
  Then science and reason careless of the soul <br />
  Could iron out a tranquil uniform world, <br />
  Aeonic seekings glut with outward truths <br />
  And a single-patterned thinking force on mind, <br />
  Inflicting Matter&#8217;s logic on Spirit&#8217;s dreams <br />
  A reasonable animal make of man <br />
  And a symmetrical fabric of his life. <br />
  This would be Nature&#8217;s peak on an obscure globe, <br />
  The grand result of the long ages&#8217; toil, <br />
  Earth&#8217;s evolution crowned, her mission done.</p>

<p>So might it be if the spirit fell asleep; <br />
  Man then might rest content and live in peace, <br />
  Master of Nature who once her bondslave worked, <br />
  The world&#8217;s disorder hardening into Law,&#8211; <br />
  If Life&#8217;s dire heart arose not in revolt, <br />
  If God within could find no greater plan. <br />
  But many-visaged is the cosmic Soul; <br />
  A touch can alter the fixed front of Fate. <br />
  A sudden turn can come, a road appear. <br />
  A greater Mind may see a greater Truth, <br />
  Or we may find when all the rest has failed <br />
  Hid in ourselves the key of perfect change. <br />
  Ascending from the soil where creep our days, <br />
  Earth&#8217;s consciousness may marry with the Sun, <br />
  Our mortal life ride on the spirit&#8217;s wings, <br />
  Our finite thoughts commune with the Infinite. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In the bright kingdoms of the rising Sun <br />
  All is a birth into a power of light: <br />
  All here deformed guards there its happy shape, <br />
  Here all is mixed and marred, there pure and whole; <br />
  Yet each is a passing step, a moment&#8217;s phase. <br />
  Awake to a greater Truth beyond her acts, <br />
  The mediatrix sat and saw her works <br />
  And felt the marvel in them and the force <br />
  But knew the power behind the face of Time: <br />
  She did the task, obeyed the knowledge given, <br />
  Her deep heart yearned towards great ideal things <br />
  And from the light looked out to wider light: <br />
  A brilliant hedge drawn round her narrowed her power; <br />
  Faithful to her limited sphere she toiled, but knew <br />
  Its highest, widest seeing was a half-search, <br />
  Its mightiest acts a passage or a stage. <br />
  For not by Reason was creation made <br />
  And not by Reason can the Truth be seen <br />
  Which through the veils of thought, the screens of sense <br />
  Hardly the spirit&#8217;s vision can descry</p>

<p>Dimmed by the imperfection of its means: <br />
  The little Mind is tied to little things: <br />
  Its sense is but the spirit&#8217;s outward touch, <br />
  Half-waked in a world of dark Inconscience; <br />
  It feels out for its beings and its forms <br />
  Like one left fumbling in the ignorant Night. <br />
  In this small mould of infant mind and sense <br />
  Desire is a child-heart&#8217;s cry crying for bliss, <br />
  Our reason only a toys&#8217; artificer, <br />
  A rule-maker in a strange stumbling game. <br />
  But she her dwarf aides knew whose confident sight <br />
  A bounded prospect took for the far goal. <br />
  The world she has made is an interim report <br />
  Of a traveller towards the half-found truth in things <br />
  Moving twixt nescience and nescience. <br />
  For nothing is known while aught remains concealed; <br />
  The Truth is known only when all is seen. <br />
  Attracted by the All that is the One, <br />
  She yearns towards a higher light than hers; <br />
  Hid by her cults and creeds she has glimpsed God&#8217;s face: <br />
  She knows she has but found a form, a robe, <br />
  But ever she hopes to see him in her heart <br />
  And feel the body of his reality. <br />
  As yet a mask is there and not a brow, <br />
  Although sometimes two hidden eyes appear: <br />
  Reason cannot tear off that glimmering mask, <br />
  Her efforts only make it glimmer more; <br />
  In packets she ties up the Indivisible; <br />
  Finding her hands too small to hold vast Truth <br />
  She breaks up knowledge into alien parts <br />
  Or peers through cloud-rack for a vanished sun: <br />
  She sees, not understanding what she has seen, <br />
  Through the locked visages of finite things <br />
  The myriad aspects of infinity. <br />
  One day the Face must burn out through the mask. <br />
  Our ignorance is Wisdom&#8217;s chrysalis,</p>

  On the grey road that winds towards the Sun. <br />
  Even while her fingers fumble at the knots <br />
