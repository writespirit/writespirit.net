<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">An uneven broad ascent now lured his feet. <br />
  Answering a greater Nature&#8217;s troubled call <br />
  He crossed the limits of embodied Mind <br />
  And entered wide obscure disputed fields <br />
  Where all was doubt and change and nothing sure, <br />
  A world of search and toil without repose. <br />
  As one who meets the face of the Unknown, <br />
  A questioner with none to give reply, <br />
  Attracted to a problem never solved, <br />
  Always uncertain of the ground he trod, <br />
  Always drawn on to an inconstant goal <br />
  He travelled through a land peopled by doubts <br />
  In shifting confines on a quaking base. <br />
  In front he saw a boundary ever unreached <br />
  And thought himself at each step nearer now,&#8211; <br />
  A far retreating horizon of mirage. <br />
  A vagrancy was there that brooked no home, <br />
  A journey of countless paths without a close. <br />
  Nothing he found to satisfy his heart; <br />
  A tireless wandering sought and could not cease. <br />
  There life is the manifest Incalculable, <br />
  A movement of unquiet seas, a long <br />
  And venturous leap of spirit into Space, <br />
  A vexed disturbance in the eternal Calm, <br />
  An impulse and passion of the Infinite. <br />
  Assuming whatever shape her fancy wills, <br />
  Escaped from the restraint of settled forms <br />
  She has left the safety of the tried and known. <br />
  Unshepherded by the fear that walks through Time, <br />
  Undaunted by Fate that dogs and Chance that springs, <br />
  She accepts disaster as a common risk;</td>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">
<p>Careless of suffering, heedless of sin and fall, <br />
  She wrestles with danger and discovery <br />
  In the unexplored expanses of the soul. <br />
  To be seemed only a long experiment, <br />
  The hazard of a seeking ignorant Force <br />
  That tries all truths and, finding none supreme, <br />
  Moves on unsatisfied, unsure of its end. <br />
  As saw some inner mind, so life was shaped: <br />
  From thought to thought she passed, from phase to phase, <br />
  Tortured by her own powers or proud and blest, <br />
  Now master of herself, now toy and slave. <br />
  A huge inconsequence was her action&#8217;s law, <br />
  As if all possibility must be drained, <br />
  And anguish and bliss were pastimes of the heart. <br />
  In a gallop of thunder-hooved vicissitudes <br />
  She swept through the race-fields of Circumstance, <br />
  Or, swaying, she tossed between her heights and deeps, <br />
  Uplifted or broken on Time&#8217;s inconstant wheel. <br />
  Amid a tedious crawl of drab desires <br />
  She writhed, a worm mid worms in Nature&#8217;s mud, <br />
  Then, Titan-statured, took all earth for food, <br />
  Ambitioned the seas for robe, for crown the stars <br />
  And shouting strode from peak to giant peak, <br />
  Clamouring for worlds to conquer and to rule. <br />
  Then, wantonly enamoured of Sorrow&#8217;s face, <br />
  She plunged into the anguish of the depths <br />
  And, wallowing, clung to her own misery. <br />
  In dolorous converse with her squandered self <br />
  She wrote the account of all that she had lost, <br />
  Or sat with grief as with an ancient friend. <br />
  A romp of violent raptures soon was spent, <br />
  Or she lingered tied to an inadequate joy <br />
  Missing the turns of fate, missing life&#8217;s goal. <br />
  A scene was planned for all her numberless moods <br />
  Where each could be the law and way of life, <br />
  But none could offer a pure felicity;</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Only a flickering zest they left behind <br />
  Or the fierce lust that brings a dead fatigue. <br />
  Amid her swift untold variety <br />
  Something remained dissatisfied, ever the same <br />
  And in the new saw only a face of the old, <br />
  For every hour repeated all the rest <br />
  And every change prolonged the same unease. <br />
  A spirit of her self and aim unsure, <br />
  Tired soon of too much joy and happiness, <br />
  She needs the spur of pleasure and of pain <br />
  And the native taste of suffering and unrest: <br />
  She strains for an end that never can she win. <br />
  A perverse savour haunts her thirsting lips: <br />
  For the grief she weeps which came from her own choice, <br />
  For the pleasure yearns that racked with wounds her breast; <br />
  Aspiring to heaven she turns her steps towards hell. <br />
  Chance she has chosen and danger for playfellows; <br />
  Fate&#8217;s dreadful swing she has taken for cradle and seat. <br />
  Yet pure and bright from the Timeless was her birth, <br />
  A lost world-rapture lingers in her eyes, <br />
  Her moods are faces of the Infinite: <br />
  Beauty and happiness are her native right, <br />
  And endless Bliss is her eternal home. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This now revealed its antique face of joy, <br />
  A sudden disclosure to the heart of grief <br />
  Tempting it to endure and long and hope. <br />
  Even in changing worlds bereft of peace, <br />
  In an air racked with sorrow and with fear <br />
  And while his feet trod on a soil unsafe, <br />
  He saw the image of a happier state. <br />
  In an architecture of hieratic Space <br />
  Circling and mounting towards creation&#8217;s tops, <br />
  At a blue height which never was too high <br />
  For warm communion between body and soul, <br />
  As far as heaven, as near as thought and hope,</p>

<p>Glimmered the kingdom of a griefless life. <br />
  Above him in a new celestial vault <br />
  Other than the heavens beheld by mortal eyes, <br />
  As on a fretted ceiling of the gods, <br />
  An archipelago of laughter and fire, <br />
  Swam stars apart in a rippled sea of sky. <br />
  Towered spirals, magic rings of vivid hue <br />
  And gleaming spheres of strange felicity <br />
  Floated through distance like a symbol world. <br />
  On the trouble and the toil they could not share, <br />
  On the unhappiness they could not aid, <br />

  Of their immortal gladness they live sure. <br />
  Apart in their self-glory plunged, remote <br />
  Burning they swam in a vague lucent haze, <br />
  An everlasting refuge of dream-light, <br />
  A nebula of the splendours of the gods <br />
  Made from the musings of eternity. <br />
  Almost unbelievable by human faith, <br />
  Hardly they seemed the stuff of things that are. <br />
  As through a magic television&#8217;s glass <br />
  Outlined to some magnifying inner eye <br />
  They shone like images thrown from a far scene <br />
  Too high and glad for mortal lids to seize. <br />
  But near and real to the longing heart <br />
  And to the body&#8217;s passionate thought and sense <br />
  Are the hidden kingdoms of beatitude. <br />
  In some close unattained realm which yet we feel, <br />
  Immune from the harsh clutch of Death and Time, <br />
  Escaping the search of sorrow and desire, <br />
  In bright enchanted safe peripheries <br />
  For ever wallowing in bliss they lie.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">In dream and trance and muse before our eyes, <br />
  Across a subtle vision&#8217;s inner field, <br />
  Wide rapturous landscapes fleeting from the sight, <br />
  The figures of the perfect kingdom pass <br />
  And behind them leave a shining memory&#8217;s trail. <br />
  Imagined scenes or great eternal worlds, <br />
  Dream-caught or sensed, they touch our hearts with their depths; <br />
  Unreal-seeming, yet more real than life, <br />
  Happier than happiness, truer than things true, <br />
  If dreams these were or captured images, <br />
  Dream&#8217;s truth made false earth&#8217;s vain realities. <br />
  In a swift eternal moment fixed there live <br />
  Or ever recalled come back to longing eyes <br />
  Calm heavens of imperishable Light, <br />
  Illumined continents of violet peace, <br />
  Oceans and rivers of the mirth of God <br />
  And griefless countries under purple suns. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, once a star of bright remote idea <br />
  Or imagination&#8217;s comet trail of dream, <br />
  Took now a close shape of reality. <br />
  The gulf between dream-truth, earth-fact was crossed, <br />
  The wonder-worlds of life were dreams no more; <br />
  His vision made all they unveiled its own: <br />
  Their scenes, their happenings met his eyes and heart <br />
  And smote them with pure loveliness and bliss. <br />
  A breathless summit region drew his gaze <br />
  Whose boundaries jutted into a sky of Self <br />
  And dipped towards a strange ethereal base. <br />
  The quintessence glowed of Life&#8217;s supreme delight. <br />
  On a spiritual and mysterious peak <br />
  Only a miracle&#8217;s high transfiguring line <br />
  Divided life from the formless Infinite <br />
  And sheltered Time against eternity. <br />
  Out of that formless stuff Time mints his shapes; <br />
  The Eternal&#8217;s quiet holds the cosmic act:</p>

<p>The protean images of the World-Force <br />
  Have drawn the strength to be, the will to last <br />
  From a deep ocean of dynamic peace. <br />
  Inverting the spirit&#8217;s apex towards life, <br />
  She spends the plastic liberties of the One <br />
  To cast in acts the dreams of her caprice, <br />
  His wisdom&#8217;s call steadies her careless feet, <br />
  He props her dance upon a rigid base, <br />
  His timeless still immutability <br />
  Must standardise her creation&#8217;s miracle. <br />
  Out of the Void&#8217;s unseeing energies <br />
  Inventing the scene of a concrete universe, <br />
  By his thought she has fixed its paces, in its blind acts <br />
  She sees by flashes of his all-knowing Light. <br />
  At her will the inscrutable Supermind leans down <br />
  To guide her force that feels but cannot know, <br />
  Its breath of power controls her restless seas <br />
  And life obeys the governing Idea. <br />
  At her will, led by a luminous Immanence <br />
  The hazardous experimenting Mind <br />
  Pushes its way through obscure possibles <br />
  Mid chance formations of an unknowing world. <br />
  Our human ignorance moves towards the Truth <br />
  That Nescience may become omniscient, <br />
  Transmuted instincts shape to divine thoughts, <br />
  Thoughts house infallible immortal sight <br />
  And Nature climb towards God&#8217;s identity. <br />
  The Master of the worlds self-made her slave <br />
  Is the executor of her fantasies: <br />
  She has canalised the seas of omnipotence; <br />
  She has limited by her laws the Illimitable. <br />
  The Immortal bound himself to do her works; <br />
  He labours at the tasks her Ignorance sets, <br />
  Hidden in the cape of our mortality. <br />
  The worlds, the forms her goddess fancy makes <br />
  Have lost their origin on unseen heights:</p>

  The light of God she has parted from his dark <br />

  Here mingling in man&#8217;s heart their tones and hues <br />

  His life a forward-rippling stream in Time, <br />
  His nature&#8217;s constant fixed mobility, <br />
  His soul a moving picture&#8217;s changeful film, <br />
  His cosmos-chaos of personality. <br />
  The grand creatrix with her cryptic touch <br />
  Has turned to pathos and power being&#8217;s self-dream, <br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But here were worlds lifted half-way to heaven. <br />
  The Veil was there but not the Shadowy Wall; <br />
  In forms not too remote from human grasp <br />
  Some passion of the inviolate purity <br />
  Broke through, a ray of the original Bliss. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s joys might have been earth&#8217;s if earth were pure. <br />
  There could have reached our divinised sense and heart <br />
  Some natural felicity&#8217;s bright extreme, <br />
  Some thrill of Supernature&#8217;s absolutes: <br />
  All strengths could laugh and sport on earth&#8217;s hard roads <br />
  And never feel her cruel edge of pain, <br />
  All love could play and nowhere Nature&#8217;s shame. <br />
  But she has stabled her dreams in Matter&#8217;s courts <br />
  And still her doors are barred to things supreme. <br />
  These worlds could feel God&#8217;s breath visiting their tops; <br />
  Some glimmer of the Transcendent&#8217;s hem was there. <br />
  Across the white aeonic silences <br />
  Immortal figures of embodied joy <br />
  Traversed wide spaces near to eternity&#8217;s sleep. <br />
  Pure mystic voices in beatitude&#8217;s hush <br />
  Appealed to Love&#8217;s immaculate sweetnesses, <br />
  Calling his honeyed touch to thrill the worlds, <br />
  His blissful hands to seize on Nature&#8217;s limbs, <br />
  His sweet intolerant might of union <br />
  To take all beings into his saviour arms, <br />
  Drawing to his pity the rebel and the waif <br />
  To force on them the happiness they refuse. <br />
  A chant hymeneal to the unseen Divine, <br />
  A flaming rhapsody of white desire <br />
  Lured an immortal music into the heart <br />
  And woke the slumbering ear of ecstasy. <br />
  A purer, fierier sense had there its home, <br />
  A burning urge no earthly limbs can hold; <br />
  One drew a large unburdened spacious breath <br />
  And the heart sped from beat to rapturous beat. <br />
  The voice of Time sang of the Immortal&#8217;s joy;</p>

<p>An inspiration and a lyric cry, <br />
  The moments came with ecstasy on their wings; <br />
  Beauty unimaginable moved heaven-bare <br />
  Absolved from boundaries in the vasts of dream; <br />
  The cry of the Birds of Wonder called from the skies <br />
  To the deathless people of the shores of Light. <br />
  Creation leaped straight from the hands of God; <br />
  Marvel and rapture wandered in the ways. <br />
  Only to be was a supreme delight, <br />
  Life was a happy laughter of the soul <br />
  And Joy was king with Love for minister. <br />
  The spirit&#8217;s luminousness was bodied there. <br />
  Life&#8217;s contraries were lovers or natural friends <br />
  And her extremes keen edges of harmony: <br />
  Indulgence with a tender purity came <br />
  And nursed the god on her maternal breast: <br />
  There none was weak, so falsehood could not live; <br />
  Ignorance was a thin shade protecting light, <br />
  Imagination the free-will of Truth, <br />
  Pleasure a candidate for heaven&#8217;s fire; <br />
  The intellect was Beauty&#8217;s worshipper, <br />
  Strength was the slave of calm spiritual law, <br />
  Power laid its head upon the breasts of Bliss. <br />
  There were summit-glories inconceivable, <br />
  Autonomies of Wisdom&#8217;s still self-rule <br />
  And high dependencies of her virgin sun, <br />
  Illumined theocracies of the seeing soul <br />
  Throned in the power of the Transcendent&#8217;s ray. <br />
  A vision of grandeurs, a dream of magnitudes <br />
  In sun-bright kingdoms moved with regal gait: <br />
  Assemblies, crowded senates of the gods, <br />
  Life&#8217;s puissances reigned on seats of marble will, <br />
  High dominations and autocracies <br />
  And laurelled strengths and armed imperative mights. <br />
  All objects there were great and beautiful, <br />
  All beings wore a royal stamp of power.</p>

<p>There sat the oligarchies of natural Law, <br />
  Proud violent heads served one calm monarch brow: <br />
  All the soul&#8217;s postures donned divinity. <br />
  There met the ardent mutual intimacies <br />
  Of mastery&#8217;s joy and the joy of servitude <br />
  Imposed by Love on Love&#8217;s heart that obeys <br />
  And Love&#8217;s body held beneath a rapturous yoke. <br />
  All was a game of meeting kinglinesses. <br />
  For worship lifts the worshipper&#8217;s bowed strength <br />
  Close to the god&#8217;s pride and bliss his soul adores: <br />
  The ruler there is one with all he rules; <br />
  To him who serves with a free equal heart <br />
  Obedience is his princely training&#8217;s school, <br />
  His nobility&#8217;s coronet and privilege, <br />
  His faith is a high nature&#8217;s idiom, <br />
  His service a spiritual sovereignty. <br />
  There were realms where Knowledge joined creative Power <br />
  In her high home and made her all his own: <br />
  The grand Illuminate seized her gleaming limbs <br />
  And filled them with the passion of his ray <br />
  Till all her body was its transparent house <br />
  And all her soul a counterpart of his soul. <br />
  Apotheosised, transfigured by wisdom&#8217;s touch, <br />
  Her days became a luminous sacrifice; <br />
  An immortal moth in happy and endless fire, <br />
  She burned in his sweet intolerable blaze. <br />
  A captive Life wedded her conqueror. <br />
  In his wide sky she built her world anew; <br />
  She gave to mind&#8217;s calm pace the motor&#8217;s speed, <br />
  To thinking a need to live what the soul saw, <br />
  To living an impetus to know and see. <br />
  His splendour grasped her, her puissance to him clung; <br />
  She crowned the Idea a king in purple robes, <br />
  Put her magic serpent sceptre in Thought&#8217;s grip, <br />
  Made forms his inward vision&#8217;s rhythmic shapes <br />
  And her acts the living body of his will.</p>

  A swift life-impulse stinted not nor stopped: <br />

  Sported with the white mane of tossing seas, <br />
  Slew distance trampled to death under their wheels <br />
  And wrestled in the arenas of their force. <br />
  Imperious in their radiance like the suns <br />
  They kindled heaven with the glory of their limbs <br />
  Flung like a divine largess to the world. <br />
  A spell to force the heart to stark delight, <br />
  They carried the pride and mastery of their charm</p>

<p>As if Life&#8217;s banner on the roads of Space. <br />
  Ideas were luminous comrades of the soul; <br />
  Mind played with speech, cast javelins of thought, <br />
  But needed not these instruments&#8217; toil to know; <br />
  Knowledge was Nature&#8217;s pastime like the rest. <br />

  A fortunate gait of days in tranquil air, <br />

  A sovereignty of tireless sweetness lived <br />

  A large spontaneous order freed the will, <br />

  In a happy series climbed or plunged these worlds: <br />

  In fields of grandeur and of titan power, <br />
  Life played at ease with her immense desires. <br />
  A thousand Edens she could build nor pause; <br />
  No bound was set to her greatness and to her grace <br />
  And to her heavenly variety. <br />

<p>And still it keeps the habit of its birth: <br />
  A dire duality is our way to be. <br />
  In the crude beginnings of this mortal world <br />
  Life was not nor mind&#8217;s play nor heart&#8217;s desire. <br />
  When earth was built in the unconscious Void <br />
  And nothing was save a material scene, <br />
  Identified with sea and sky and stone <br />
  Her young gods yearned for the release of souls <br />
  Asleep in objects, vague, inanimate. <br />
  In that desolate grandeur, in that beauty bare, <br />
  In the deaf stillness, mid the unheeded sounds, <br />
  Heavy was the uncommunicated load <br />
  Of Godhead in a world that had no needs; <br />
  For none was there to feel or to receive. <br />
  This solid mass which brooked no throb of sense <br />
  Could not contain their vast creative urge: <br />
  Immersed no more in Matter&#8217;s harmony, <br />
  The Spirit lost its statuesque repose. <br />
  In the uncaring trance it groped for sight, <br />
  Passioned for the movements of a conscious heart, <br />
  Famishing for speech and thought and joy and love, <br />
  In the dumb insensitive wheeling day and night <br />
  Hungered for the beat of yearning and response. <br />
  The poised inconscience shaken with a touch, <br />
  The intuitive Silence trembling with a name, <br />
  They cried to Life to invade the senseless mould <br />
  And in brute forms awake divinity. <br />
  A voice was heard on the mute rolling globe, <br />
  A murmur moaned in the unlistening Void. <br />
  A being seemed to breathe where once was none: <br />
  Something pent up in dead insentient depths, <br />
  Denied conscious existence, lost to joy, <br />
  Turned as if one asleep since dateless time. <br />
  Aware of its own buried reality, <br />
  Remembering its forgotten self and right, <br />
  It yearned to know, to aspire, to enjoy, to live.</p>

<p>Life heard the call and left her native light. <br />
  Overflowing from her bright magnificent plane <br />
  On the rigid coil and sprawl of mortal Space, <br />
  Here too the gracious great-winged Angel poured <br />
  Her splendour and her swiftness and her bliss, <br />
  Hoping to fill a fair new world with joy. <br />
  As comes a goddess to a mortal&#8217;s breast <br />
  And fills his days with her celestial clasp, <br />
  She stooped to make her home in transient shapes; <br />
  In Matter&#8217;s womb she cast the Immortal&#8217;s fire, <br />
  In the unfeeling Vast woke thought and hope, <br />
  Smote with her charm and beauty flesh and nerve <br />
  And forced delight on earth&#8217;s insensible frame. <br />
  Alive and clad with trees and herbs and flowers <br />
  Earth&#8217;s great brown body smiled towards the skies, <br />
  Azure replied to azure in the sea&#8217;s laugh; <br />
  New sentient creatures filled the unseen depths, <br />
  Life&#8217;s glory and swiftness ran in the beauty of beasts, <br />
  Man dared and thought and met with his soul the world. <br />
  But while the magic breath was on its way, <br />
  Before her gifts could reach our prisoned hearts, <br />
  A dark ambiguous Presence questioned all. <br />
  The secret Will that robes itself with Night <br />
  And offers to spirit the ordeal of the flesh, <br />
  Imposed a mystic mask of death and pain. <br />
  Interned now in the slow and suffering years <br />
  Sojourns the winged and wonderful wayfarer <br />
  And can no more recall her happier state, <br />
  But must obey the inert Inconscient&#8217;s law, <br />
  Insensible foundation of a world <br />
  In which blind limits are on beauty laid <br />
  And sorrow and joy as struggling comrades live. <br />
  A dim and dreadful muteness fell on her: <br />
  Abolished was her subtle mighty spirit <br />
  And slain her boon of child-god happiness, <br />
  And all her glory into littleness turned</p>

  To feed death with her works is here life&#8217;s doom. <br />
  So veiled was her immortality that she seemed, <br />
  Inflicting consciousness on unconscious things, <br />
  An episode in an eternal death, <br />
  A myth of being that must for ever cease. <br />
  Such was the evil mystery of her change. </p>
