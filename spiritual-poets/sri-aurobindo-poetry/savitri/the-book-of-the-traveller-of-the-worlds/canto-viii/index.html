<p>Then could he see the hidden heart of Night: <br />
  The labour of its stark unconsciousness <br />
  Revealed the endless terrible Inane. <br />
  A spiritless blank Infinity was there; <br />
  A Nature that denied the eternal Truth <br />
  In the vain braggart freedom of its thought <br />
  Hoped to abolish God and reign alone. <br />
  There was no sovereign Guest, no witness Light; <br />
  Unhelped it would create its own bleak world. <br />
  Its large blind eyes looked out on demon acts, <br />
  Its deaf ears heard the untruth its dumb lips spoke; <br />
  Its huge misguided fancy took vast shapes, <br />
  Its mindless sentience quivered with fierce conceits; <br />
  Engendering a brute principle of life <br />
  Evil and pain begot a monstrous soul. <br />
  The Anarchs of the formless depths arose, <br />
  Great Titan beings and demoniac powers, <br />
  World-egos racked with lust and thought and will, <br />
  Vast minds and lives without a spirit within: <br />
  Impatient architects of error&#8217;s house, <br />
  Leaders of the cosmic ignorance and unrest <br />
  And sponsors of sorrow and mortality <br />
  Embodied the dark Ideas of the Abyss. <br />
  A shadow substance into emptiness came, <br />
  Dim forms were born in the unthinking Void <br />
  And eddies met and made an adverse Space <br />
  In whose black folds Being imagined Hell. <br />
  His eyes piercing the triple-plated gloom <br />
  Identified their sight with its blind stare: <br />
  Accustomed to the unnatural dark, they saw</p>

<p>Unreality made real and conscious Night. <br />
  A violent, fierce and formidable world, <br />
  An ancient womb of huge calamitous dreams, <br />
  Coiled like a larva in the obscurity <br />
  That keeps it from the spear-points of Heaven&#8217;s stars. <br />
  It was the gate of a false Infinite, <br />
  An eternity of disastrous absolutes, <br />
  An immense negation of spiritual things. <br />
  All once self-luminous in the spirit&#8217;s sphere <br />
  Turned now into their own dark contraries: <br />
  Being collapsed into a pointless void <br />
  That yet was a zero parent of the worlds; <br />
  Inconscience swallowing up the cosmic Mind <br />
  Produced a universe from its lethal sleep; <br />
  Bliss into black coma fallen, insensible, <br />
  Coiled back to itself and God&#8217;s eternal joy <br />
  Through a false poignant figure of grief and pain <br />
  Still dolorously nailed upon a cross <br />
  Fixed in the soil of a dumb insentient world <br />
  Where birth was a pang and death an agony, <br />
  Lest all too soon should change again to bliss. <br />
  Thought sat, a priestess of Perversity, <br />
  On her black tripod of the triune Snake <br />
  Reading by opposite signs the eternal script, <br />
  A sorceress reversing life&#8217;s God-frame. <br />
  In darkling aisles with evil eyes for lamps <br />
  And fatal voices chanting from the apse, <br />
  In strange infernal dim basilicas <br />
  Intoning the magic of the unholy Word, <br />
  The ominous profound Initiate <br />
  Performed the ritual of her Mysteries. <br />
  There suffering was Nature&#8217;s daily food <br />
  Alluring to the anguished heart and flesh, <br />
  And torture was the formula of delight, <br />
  Pain mimicked the celestial ecstasy. <br />
  There Good, a faithless gardener of God,</p>

  And, careful of the outward word and act, <br />
  Engrafted his hypocrite blooms on native ill. <br />
  All high things served their nether opposite: <br />
  The forms of Gods sustained a demon cult; <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s face became a mask and snare of Hell. <br />
  There in the heart of vain phenomenon, <br />
  In an enormous action&#8217;s writhen core <br />
  He saw a Shape illimitable and vague <br />
  Sitting on Death who swallows all things born. <br />
  A chill fixed face with dire and motionless eyes, <br />
  Her dreadful trident in her shadowy hand <br />
  Outstretched, she pierced all creatures with one fate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When nothing was save Matter without soul <br />
  And a spiritless hollow was the heart of Time, <br />
  Then Life first touched the insensible Abyss; <br />
  Awaking the stark Void to hope and grief <br />
  Her pallid beam smote the unfathomed Night <br />
  In which God hid himself from his own view. <br />
  In all things she sought their slumbering mystic truth, <br />
  The unspoken Word that inspires unconscious forms; <br />
  She groped in his deeps for an invisible Law, <br />
  Fumbled in the dim subconscient for his mind <br />
  And strove to find a way for spirit to be. <br />
  But from the Night another answer came. <br />
  A seed was in that nether matrix cast, <br />
  A dumb unprobed husk of perverted truth, <br />
  A cell of an insentient infinite. <br />
  A monstrous birth prepared its cosmic form <br />
  In Nature&#8217;s titan embryo, Ignorance. <br />
  Then in a fatal and stupendous hour <br />
  Something that sprang from the stark Inconscient&#8217;s sleep <br />
  Unwillingly begotten by the mute Void, <br />
  Lifted its ominous head against the stars; <br />
  Overshadowing earth with its huge body of Doom</p>

<p>It chilled the heavens with the menace of a face. <br />
  A nameless Power, a shadowy Will arose <br />
  Immense and alien to our universe. <br />
  In the inconceivable Purpose none can gauge <br />
  A vast Non-Being robed itself with shape, <br />
  The boundless Nescience of the unconscious depths <br />
  Covered eternity with nothingness. <br />
  A seeking Mind replaced the seeing Soul: <br />
  Life grew into a huge and hungry death, <br />
  The Spirit&#8217;s bliss was changed to cosmic pain. <br />
  Assuring God&#8217;s self-cowled neutrality <br />
  A mighty opposition conquered Space. <br />
  A sovereign ruling falsehood, death and grief, <br />
  It pressed its fierce hegemony on the earth; <br />
  Disharmonising the original style <br />
  Of the architecture of her fate&#8217;s design, <br />
  It falsified the primal cosmic Will <br />
  And bound to struggle and dread vicissitudes <br />
  The long slow process of the patient Power. <br />
  Implanting error in the stuff of things <br />
  It made an Ignorance of the all-wise Law; <br />
  It baffled the sure touch of life&#8217;s hid sense, <br />
  Kept dumb the intuitive guide in Matter&#8217;s sleep, <br />
  Deformed the insect&#8217;s instinct and the brute&#8217;s, <br />
  Disfigured man&#8217;s thought-born humanity. <br />
  A shadow fell across the simple Ray: <br />
  Obscured was the Truth-light in the cavern heart <br />
  That burns unwitnessed in the altar crypt <br />
  Behind the still velamen&#8217;s secrecy <br />
  Companioning the Godhead of the shrine. <br />
  Thus was the dire antagonist Energy born <br />
  Who mimes the eternal Mother&#8217;s mighty shape <br />
  And mocks her luminous infinity <br />
  With a grey distorted silhouette in the Night. <br />
  Arresting the passion of the climbing soul, <br />
  She forced on life a slow and faltering pace;</p>

<p>Her hand&#8217;s deflecting and retarding weight <br />
  Is laid on the mystic evolution&#8217;s curve: <br />
  The tortuous line of her deceiving mind <br />
  The Gods see not and man is impotent; <br />
  Oppressing the God-spark within the soul <br />
  She forces back to the beast the human fall. <br />
  Yet in her formidable instinctive mind <br />
  She feels the One grow in the heart of Time <br />
  And sees the Immortal shine through the human mould. <br />
  Alarmed for her rule and full of fear and rage <br />
  She prowls around each light that gleams through the dark <br />
  Casting its ray from the spirit&#8217;s lonely tent, <br />
  Hoping to enter with fierce stealthy tread <br />
  And in the cradle slay the divine Child. <br />
  Incalculable are her strength and ruse; <br />
  Her touch is a fascination and a death; <br />
  She kills her victim with his own delight; <br />
  Even Good she makes a hook to drag to Hell. <br />
  For her the world runs to its agony. <br />
  Often the pilgrim on the Eternal&#8217;s road <br />
  Ill-lit from clouds by the pale moon of Mind, <br />
  Or in devious byways wandering alone, <br />
  Or lost in deserts where no path is seen, <br />
  Falls overpowered by her lion leap, <br />
  A conquered captive under her dreadful paws. <br />
  Intoxicated by a burning breath <br />
  And amorous grown of a destroying mouth, <br />
  Once a companion of the sacred Fire, <br />
  The mortal perishes to God and Light, <br />
  An Adversary governs heart and brain, <br />
  A Nature hostile to the Mother-Force. <br />
  The self of life yields up its instruments <br />
  To Titan and demoniac agencies <br />
  That aggrandise earth-nature and disframe: <br />
  A cowled fifth-columnist is now thought&#8217;s guide; <br />
  His subtle defeatist murmur slays the faith</p>

  A lying inspiration fell and dark <br />
  A new order substitutes for the divine. <br />
  A silence falls upon the spirit&#8217;s heights, <br />
  From the veiled sanctuary the God retires, <br />
  Empty and cold is the chamber of the Bride; <br />
  The golden Nimbus now is seen no more, <br />
  No longer burns the white spiritual ray <br />
  And hushed for ever is the secret Voice. <br />
  Then by the Angel of the Vigil Tower <br />
  A name is struck from the recording book; <br />
  A flame that sang in Heaven sinks quenched and mute; <br />
  In ruin ends the epic of a soul. <br />
  This is the tragedy of the inner death <br />
  When forfeited is the divine element <br />
  And only a mind and body live to die. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For terrible agencies the Spirit allows <br />
  And there are subtle and enormous Powers <br />
  That shield themselves with the covering Ignorance. <br />
  Offspring of the gulfs, agents of the shadowy Force, <br />
  Haters of light, intolerant of peace, <br />
  Aping to the thought the shining Friend and Guide, <br />
  Opposing in the heart the eternal Will, <br />
  They veil the occult uplifting Harmonist. <br />
  His wisdom&#8217;s oracles are made our bonds; <br />
  The doors of God they have locked with keys of creed <br />
  And shut out by the Law his tireless Grace. <br />
  Along all Nature&#8217;s lines they have set their posts <br />
  And intercept the caravans of Light; <br />
  Wherever the Gods act, they intervene. <br />
  A yoke is laid upon the world&#8217;s dim heart; <br />
  Masked are its beats from the supernal Bliss, <br />
  And the closed peripheries of brilliant Mind <br />
  Block the fine entries of celestial Fire. <br />
  Always the dark Adventurers seem to win;</p>

  All the fierce bale with which the world is racked <br />
  Is mixed in the foaming chalice of man&#8217;s heart <br />

  Assuming names divine they guide and rule. <br />
  Opponents of the Highest they have come <br />
  Out of their world of soulless thought and power <br />
  To serve by enmity the cosmic scheme. <br />
  Night is their refuge and strategic base. <br />
  Against the sword of Flame, the luminous Eye, <br />
  Bastioned they live in massive forts of gloom, <br />
  Calm and secure in sunless privacy: <br />
  No wandering ray of Heaven can enter there. <br />
  Armoured, protected by their lethal masks, <br />
  As in a studio of creative Death <br />
  The giant sons of Darkness sit and plan</p>

  All who would raise the fallen world must come <br />
  Under the dangerous arches of their power; <br />
  For even the radiant children of the gods <br />
  To darken their privilege is and dreadful right. <br />
  None can reach heaven who has not passed through hell. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This too the traveller of the worlds must dare. <br />
  A warrior in the dateless duel&#8217;s strife, <br />
  He entered into dumb despairing Night <br />
  Challenging the darkness with his luminous soul. <br />
  Alarming with his steps the threshold gloom <br />
  He came into a fierce and dolorous realm <br />
  Peopled by souls who never had tasted bliss; <br />
  Ignorant like men born blind who know not light, <br />
  They could equate worst ill with highest good, <br />
  Virtue was to their eyes a face of sin <br />
  And evil and misery were their natural state. <br />
  A dire administration&#8217;s penal code <br />
  Making of grief and pain the common law, <br />
  Decreeing universal joylessness <br />
  Had changed life into a stoic sacrament <br />
  And torture into a daily festival. <br />
  An act was passed to chastise happiness; <br />
  Laughter and pleasure were banned as deadly sins: <br />
  A questionless mind was ranked as wise content, <br />
  A dull heart&#8217;s silent apathy as peace: <br />
  Sleep was not there, torpor was the sole rest, <br />
  Death came but neither respite gave nor end; <br />
  Always the soul lived on and suffered more. <br />
  Ever he deeper probed that kingdom of pain; <br />
  Around him grew the terror of a world <br />
  Of agony followed by worse agony, <br />
  And in the terror a great wicked joy <br />
  Glad of one&#8217;s own and others&#8217; calamity. <br />
  There thought and life were a long punishment,</p>

<p>The breath a burden and all hope a scourge, <br />
  The body a field of torment, a massed unease; <br />
  Repose was a waiting between pang and pang. <br />
  This was the law of things none dreamed to change: <br />
  A hard sombre heart, a harsh unsmiling mind <br />
  Rejected happiness like a cloying sweet; <br />
  Tranquillity was a tedium and ennui: <br />
  Only by suffering life grew colourful; <br />
  It needed the spice of pain, the salt of tears. <br />
  If one could cease to be, all would be well; <br />
  Else only fierce sensations gave some zest: <br />
  A fury of jealousy burning the gnawed heart, <br />
  The sting of murderous spite and hate and lust, <br />
  The whisper that lures to the pit and treachery&#8217;s stroke <br />
  Threw vivid spots on the dull aching hours. <br />
  To watch the drama of infelicity, <br />
  The writhing of creatures under the harrow of doom <br />
  And sorrow&#8217;s tragic gaze into the night <br />
  And horror and the hammering heart of fear <br />
  Were the ingredients in Time&#8217;s heavy cup <br />
  That pleased and helped to enjoy its bitter taste. <br />
  Of such fierce stuff was made up life&#8217;s long hell: <br />
  These were the threads of the dark spider&#8217;s-web <br />
  In which the soul was caught, quivering and rapt; <br />
  This was religion, this was Nature&#8217;s rule. <br />
  In a fell chapel of iniquity <br />
  To worship a black pitiless image of Power <br />
  Kneeling one must cross hard-hearted stony courts, <br />
  A pavement like a floor of evil fate. <br />
  Each stone was a keen edge of ruthless force <br />
  And glued with the chilled blood from tortured breasts; <br />
  The dry gnarled trees stood up like dying men <br />
  Stiffened into a pose of agony, <br />
  And from each window peered an ominous priest <br />
  Chanting Te Deums for slaughter&#8217;s crowning grace, <br />
  Uprooted cities, blasted human homes, <br />
  Burned writhen bodies, the bombshell&#8217;s massacre.</p>

  &#8220;All who once stayed our will are smitten and dead; <br />
  How great we are, how merciful art Thou.&#8221; <br />

  Who held in thrall a miserable world, <br />
  And helpless hearts nailed to unceasing woe <br />
  Adored the feet that trampled them into mire. <br />
  It was a world of sorrow and of hate, <br />
  Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy, <br />
  Hatred with others&#8217; sorrow as its feast; <br />
  A bitter rictus curled the suffering mouth; <br />
  A tragic cruelty saw its ominous chance. <br />
  Hate was the black archangel of that realm; <br />
  It glowed, a sombre jewel in the heart <br />
  Burning the soul with its malignant rays, <br />
  And wallowed in its fell abysm of might. <br />
  These passions even objects seemed to exude,&#8211; <br />
  For mind overflowed into the inanimate <br />
  That answered with the wickedness it received,&#8211; <br />
  Against their users used malignant powers, <br />
  Hurt without hands and strangely, suddenly slew, <br />
  Appointed as instruments of an unseen doom. <br />
  Or they made themselves a fateful prison wall <br />
  Where men condemned wake through the creeping hours <br />
  Counted by the tollings of an ominous bell. <br />
  An evil environment worsened evil souls: <br />
  All things were conscious there and all perverse. <br />
  In this infernal realm he dared to press <br />

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Falsehood gave back to Truth her tortured shape. <br />
  Annulled were the tables of the law of Pain, <br />
  And in their place grew luminous characters. <br />
  The skilful Penman&#8217;s unseen finger wrote <br />
  His swift intuitive calligraphy; <br />
  Earth&#8217;s forms were made his divine documents, <br />
  The wisdom embodied mind could not reveal, <br />
  Inconscience chased from the world&#8217;s voiceless breast; <br />
  Transfigured were the fixed schemes of reasoning Thought. <br />
  Arousing consciousness in things inert, <br />
  He imposed upon dark atom and dumb mass <br />
  The diamond script of the Imperishable, <br />
  Inscribed on the dim heart of fallen things <br />
  A paean-song of the free Infinite <br />
  And the Name, foundation of eternity, <br />
  And traced on the awake exultant cells <br />
  In the ideographs of the Ineffable <br />
  The lyric of the love that waits through Time <br />
  And the mystic volume of the Book of Bliss <br />
  And the message of the superconscient Fire. <br />
  Then life beat pure in the corporeal frame; <br />
  The infernal Gleam died and could slay no more. <br />
  Hell split across its huge abrupt facade <br />
  As if a magic building were undone, <br />
  Night opened and vanished like a gulf of dream. <br />
  Into being&#8217;s gap scooped out as empty Space <br />
  In which she had filled the place of absent God, <br />
  There poured a wide intimate and blissful Dawn; <br />
  Healed were all things that Time&#8217;s torn heart had made <br />
  And sorrow could live no more in Nature&#8217;s breast: <br />
  Division ceased to be, for God was there. <br />
  The soul lit the conscious body with its ray, <br />
  Matter and spirit mingled and were one. </p>
