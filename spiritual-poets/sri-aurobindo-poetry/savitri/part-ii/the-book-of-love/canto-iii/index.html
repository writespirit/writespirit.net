  </td>
<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Out of the voiceless mystery of the past <br />
  In a present ignorant of forgotten bonds <br />
  These spirits met upon the roads of Time. <br />
  Yet in the heart their secret conscious selves <br />
  At once aware grew of each other warned <br />
  By the first call of a delightful voice <br />
  And a first vision of the destined face. <br />
  As when being cries to being from its depths <br />
  Behind the screen of the external sense <br />
  And strives to find the heart-disclosing word, <br />
  The passionate speech revealing the soul&#8217;s need, <br />
  But the mind&#8217;s ignorance veils the inner sight, <br />
  Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds, <br />
  So now they met in that momentous hour, <br />
  So utter the recognition in the deeps, <br />
  The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed. <br />
  Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri: <br />
  &#8220;O thou who com&#8217;st to me out of Time&#8217;s silences, <br />
  Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss, <br />
  Immortal or mortal only in thy frame, <br />
  For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul <br />
  And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze, <br />
  How art thou named among the sons of men? <br />
  Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit&#8217;s days, <br />
  Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers, <br />
  Into the lonely borders of my life, <br />
  O sunlight moulded like a golden maid? <br />
  I know that mighty gods are friends of earth. <br />
  Amid the pageantries of day and dusk, <br />
  Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul <br />
  Moved by the marvel of familiar things.</td>

<p>Earth could not hide from me the powers she veils: <br />
  Even though moving mid an earthly scene <br />
  And the common surfaces of terrestrial things, <br />
  My vision saw unblinded by her forms; <br />
  The Godhead looked at me from familiar scenes. <br />
  I witnessed the virgin bridals of the dawn <br />
  Behind the glowing curtains of the sky <br />
  Or vying in joy with the bright morning&#8217;s steps <br />
  I paced along the slumbrous coasts of noon, <br />
  Or the gold desert of the sunlight crossed <br />
  Traversing great wastes of splendour and of fire, <br />
  Or met the moon gliding amazed through heaven <br />
  In the uncertain wideness of the night, <br />
  Or the stars marched on their long sentinel routes <br />
  Pointing their spears through the infinitudes: <br />
  The day and dusk revealed to me hidden shapes; <br />
  Figures have come to me from secret shores <br />
  And happy faces looked from ray and flame. <br />
  I have heard strange voices cross the ether&#8217;s waves, <br />
  The Centaur&#8217;s wizard song has thrilled my ear; <br />
  I have glimpsed the Apsaras bathing in the pools, <br />
  I have seen the wood-nymphs peering through the leaves; <br />
  The winds have shown to me their trampling lords, <br />
  I have beheld the princes of the Sun <br />
  Burning in thousand-pillared homes of light. <br />
  So now my mind could dream and my heart fear <br />
  That from some wonder-couch beyond our air <br />
  Risen in a wide morning of the gods <br />
  Thou drov&#8217;st thy horses from the Thunderer&#8217;s worlds. <br />
  Although to heaven thy beauty seems allied, <br />
  Much rather would my thoughts rejoice to know <br />
  That mortal sweetness smiles between thy lids <br />
  And thy heart can beat beneath a human gaze <br />
  And thy aureate bosom quiver with a look <br />
  And its tumult answer to an earth-born voice. <br />
  If our time-vexed affections thou canst feel,</p>

<p>Earth&#8217;s ease of simple things can satisfy, <br />
  If thy glance can dwell content on earthly soil, <br />
  And this celestial summary of delight, <br />
  Thy golden body, dally with fatigue <br />
  Oppressing with its grace our terrain, while <br />
  The frail sweet passing taste of earthly food <br />
  Delays thee and the torrent&#8217;s leaping wine, <br />
  Descend. Let thy journey cease, come down to us. <br />
  Close is my father&#8217;s creepered hermitage <br />
  Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings, <br />
  Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs <br />
  Whose chants repeat transcribed in music&#8217;s notes <br />
  The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs <br />
  And fill the hours with their melodious cry. <br />
  Amid the welcome-hum of many bees <br />
  Invade our honied kingdom of the woods; <br />
  There let me lead thee into an opulent life. <br />
  Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life; <br />
  Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth. <br />
  Wild winds run&#8211;visitors midst the swaying tops, <br />
  Through the calm days heaven&#8217;s sentinels of peace <br />
  Couched on a purple robe of sky above <br />
  Look down on a rich secrecy and hush <br />
  And the chambered nuptial waters chant within. <br />
  Enormous, whispering, many-formed around <br />
  High forest gods have taken in their arms <br />
  The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps. <br />
  Apparelled are the morns in gold and green, <br />
  Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls <br />
  To make a resting chamber fit for thee.&#8221; <br />
  Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice, <br />
  Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke. <br />
  Musing she answered, &#8220;I am Savitri, <br />
  Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name <br />
  Musical on earth expresses thee to men? <br />
  What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams</p>

<p>Has flowered at last upon one happy branch? <br />
  Why is thy dwelling in the pathless wood <br />
  Far from the deeds thy glorious youth demands, <br />
  Haunt of the anchorites and earth&#8217;s wilder broods, <br />
  Where only with thy witness self thou roamst <br />
  In Nature&#8217;s green unhuman loneliness <br />
  Surrounded by enormous silences <br />
  And the blind murmur of primaeval calms?&#8221; <br />
  And Satyavan replied to Savitri: <br />
  &#8220;In days when yet his sight looked clear on life, <br />
  King Dyumatsena once, the Shalwa, reigned <br />
  Through all the tract which from behind these tops <br />
  Passing its days of emerald delight <br />
  In trusting converse with the traveller winds <br />
  Turns, looking back towards the southern heavens, <br />
  And leans its flank upon the musing hills. <br />
  But equal Fate removed her covering hand. <br />
  A living night enclosed the strong man&#8217;s paths, <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s brilliant gods recalled their careless gifts, <br />
  Took from blank eyes their glad and helping ray <br />
  And led the uncertain goddess from his side. <br />
  Outcast from empire of the outer light, <br />
  Lost to the comradeship of seeing men, <br />
  He sojourns in two solitudes, within <br />
  And in the solemn rustle of the woods. <br />
  Son of that king, I, Satyavan, have lived <br />
  Contented, for not yet of thee aware, <br />
  In my high-peopled loneliness of spirit <br />
  And this huge vital murmur kin to me, <br />
  Nursed by the vastness, pupil of solitude. <br />
  Great Nature came to her recovered child; <br />
  I reigned in a kingdom of a nobler kind <br />
  Than men can build upon dull Matter&#8217;s soil; <br />
  I met the frankness of the primal earth, <br />
  I enjoyed the intimacy of infant God. <br />
  In the great tapestried chambers of her state,</p>

<p>Free in her boundless palace I have dwelt <br />
  Indulged by the warm mother of us all, <br />
  Reared with my natural brothers in her house. <br />
  I lay in the wide bare embrace of heaven, <br />
  The sunlight&#8217;s radiant blessing clasped my brow, <br />
  The moonbeams&#8217; silver ecstasy at night <br />
  Kissed my dim lids to sleep. Earth&#8217;s morns were mine; <br />
  Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours <br />
  I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice <br />
  Of winds and waters, partner of the sun&#8217;s joy, <br />
  A listener to the universal speech: <br />
  My spirit satisfied within me knew <br />
  Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life <br />
  Whose close belongings are the earth and skies. <br />
  Before Fate led me into this emerald world, <br />
  Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within, <br />
  An early prescience in my mind approached <br />
  The great dumb animal consciousness of earth <br />
  Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps <br />
  To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast. <br />
  Already I met her in my spirit&#8217;s dream. <br />
  As if to a deeper country of the soul <br />
  Transposing the vivid imagery of earth, <br />
  Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came. <br />
  A visioned spell pursued my boyhood&#8217;s hours, <br />
  All things the eye had caught in coloured lines <br />
  Were seen anew through the interpreting mind <br />
  And in the shape it sought to seize the soul. <br />
  An early child-god took my hand that held, <br />
  Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch, <br />
  Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight; <br />
  Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men. <br />
  High beauty&#8217;s visitants my intimates were. <br />
  The neighing pride of rapid life that roams <br />
  Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood <br />
  Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer</p>

<p>Against the vesper sky became a song <br />
  Of evening to the silence of my soul. <br />
  I caught for some eternal eye the sudden <br />
  King-fisher flashing to a darkling pool; <br />
  A slow swan silvering the azure lake, <br />
  A shape of magic whiteness, sailed through dream; <br />
  Leaves trembling with the passion of the wind, <br />
  Pranked butterflies, the conscious flowers of air, <br />
  And wandering wings in blue infinity <br />
  Lived on the tablets of my inner sight; <br />
  Mountains and trees stood there like thoughts from God. <br />
  The brilliant long-bills in their vivid dress, <br />
  The peacock scattering on the breeze his moons <br />
  Painted my memory like a frescoed wall. <br />
  I carved my vision out of wood and stone; <br />
  I caught the echoes of a word supreme <br />
  And metred the rhythm-beats of infinity <br />
  And listened through music for the eternal Voice. <br />
  I felt a covert touch, I heard a call, <br />
  But could not clasp the body of my God <br />
  Or hold between my hands the World-Mother&#8217;s feet. <br />
  In men I met strange portions of a Self <br />
  That sought for fragments and in fragments lived: <br />
  Each lived in himself and for himself alone <br />
  And with the rest joined only fleeting ties; <br />
  Each passioned over his surface joy and grief, <br />
  Nor saw the Eternal in his secret house. <br />
  I conversed with Nature, mused with the changeless stars, <br />
  God&#8217;s watch-fires burning in the ignorant Night, <br />
  And saw upon her mighty visage fall <br />
  A ray prophetic of the Eternal&#8217;s sun. <br />
  I sat with the forest sages in their trance: <br />
  There poured awakening streams of diamond light, <br />
  I glimpsed the presence of the One in all. <br />
  But still there lacked the last transcendent power <br />
  And Matter still slept empty of its Lord.</p>

<p>The Spirit was saved, the body lost and mute <br />
  Lived still with Death and ancient Ignorance; <br />
  The Inconscient was its base, the Void its fate. <br />
  But thou hast come and all will surely change: <br />
  I shall feel the World-Mother in thy golden limbs <br />
  And hear her wisdom in thy sacred voice. <br />
  The child of the Void shall be reborn in God, <br />
  My Matter shall evade the Inconscient&#8217;s trance. <br />
  My body like my spirit shall be free. <br />
  It shall escape from Death and Ignorance.&#8221; <br />
  And Savitri, musing still, replied to him: <br />
  &#8220;Speak more to me, speak more, O Satyavan, <br />
  Speak of thyself and all thou art within; <br />
  I would know thee as if we had ever lived <br />
  Together in the chamber of our souls. <br />
  Speak till a light shall come into my heart <br />
  And my moved mortal mind shall understand <br />
  What all the deathless being in me feels. <br />
  It knows that thou art he my spirit has sought <br />
  Amidst earth&#8217;s thronging visages and forms <br />
  Across the golden spaces of my life.&#8221; <br />
  And Satyavan like a replying harp <br />
  To the insistent calling of a flute <br />
  Answered her questioning and let stream to her <br />
  His heart in many-coloured waves of speech: <br />
  &#8220;O golden princess, perfect Savitri, <br />
  More I would tell than failing words can speak, <br />
  Of all that thou hast meant to me, unknown, <br />
  All that the lightning-flash of love reveals <br />
  In one great hour of the unveiling gods. <br />
  Even a brief nearness has reshaped my life. <br />
  For now I know that all I lived and was <br />
  Moved towards this moment of my heart&#8217;s rebirth; <br />
  I look back on the meaning of myself, <br />
  A soul made ready on earth&#8217;s soil for thee. <br />
  Once were my days like days of other men:</p>

<p>To think and act was all, to enjoy and breathe; <br />
  This was the width and height of mortal hope: <br />
  Yet there came glimpses of a deeper self <br />
  That lives behind Life and makes her act its scene. <br />
  A truth was felt that screened its shape from mind, <br />
  A Greatness working towards a hidden end, <br />
  And vaguely through the forms of earth there looked <br />
  Something that life is not and yet must be. <br />
  I groped for the Mystery with the lantern, Thought. <br />
  Its glimmerings lighted with the abstract word <br />
  A half-visible ground and travelling yard by yard <br />
  It mapped a system of the Self and God. <br />
  I could not live the truth it spoke and thought. <br />
  I turned to seize its form in visible things, <br />
  Hoping to fix its rule by mortal mind, <br />
  Imposed a narrow structure of world-law <br />
  Upon the freedom of the Infinite, <br />
  A hard firm skeleton of outward Truth, <br />
  A mental scheme of a mechanic Power. <br />
  This light showed more the darknesses unsearched; <br />
  It made the original Secrecy more occult; <br />
  It could not analyse its cosmic Veil <br />
  Or glimpse the Wonder-worker&#8217;s hidden hand <br />
  And trace the pattern of his magic plans. <br />
  I plunged into an inner seeing Mind <br />
  And knew the secret laws and sorceries <br />
  That make of Matter mind&#8217;s bewildered slave: <br />
  The mystery was not solved but deepened more. <br />
  I strove to find its hints through Beauty and Art, <br />
  But Form cannot unveil the indwelling Power; <br />
  Only it throws its symbols at our hearts. <br />
  It evoked a mood of self, invoked a sign <br />
  Of all the brooding glory hidden in sense: <br />
  I lived in the ray but faced not to the sun. <br />
  I looked upon the world and missed the Self, <br />
  And when I found the Self, I lost the world,</p>

  The link of the finite with the Infinite, <br />
  The bridge between the appearance and the Truth, <br />
  The mystic aim for which the world was made, <br />
  The human sense of Immortality. <br />

  My mind transfigures to a rapturous seer. <br />
  A foam-leap travelling from the waves of bliss <br />
  Has changed my heart and changed the earth around: <br />
  All with thy coming fills. Air, soil and stream <br />
  Wear bridal raiment to be fit for thee <br />
  And sunlight grows a shadow of thy hue <br />
  Because of change within me by thy look. <br />
  Come nearer to me from thy car of light <br />
  On this green sward disdaining not our soil. <br />

  Whose caves of emerald long to screen thy form. <br />
  Wilt thou not make this mortal bliss thy sphere? <br />
  Descend, O happiness, with thy moon-gold feet <br />
  Enrich earth&#8217;s floors upon whose sleep we lie. <br />
  O my bright beauty&#8217;s princess Savitri, <br />
  By my delight and thy own joy compelled <br />
  Enter my life, thy chamber and thy shrine. <br />
  In the great quietness where spirits meet, <br />
  Led by my hushed desire into my woods <br />
  Let the dim rustling arches over thee lean; <br />

  Thy heart-beats near to mine, till there shall leap</p>

  A moment which all murmurs shall recall <br />
  And every bird remember in its cry.&#8221; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Allured to her lashes by his passionate words <br />
  Her fathomless soul looked out at him from her eyes; <br />
  Passing her lips in liquid sounds it spoke. <br />
  This word alone she uttered and said all: <br />
  &#8220;O Satyavan, I have heard thee and I know; <br />
  I know that thou and only thou art he.&#8221; <br />
  Then down she came from her high carven car <br />
  Descending with a soft and faltering haste; <br />
  Her many-hued raiment glistening in the light <br />
  Hovered a moment over the wind-stirred grass, <br />
  Mixed with a glimmer of her body&#8217;s ray <br />
  Like lovely plumage of a settling bird. <br />
  Her gleaming feet upon the green-gold sward <br />
  Scattered a memory of wandering beams <br />
  And lightly pressed the unspoken desire of earth <br />
  Cherished in her too brief passing by the soil. <br />
  Then flitting like pale-brilliant moths her hands <br />
  Took from the sylvan verge&#8217;s sunlit arms <br />
  A load of their jewel-faces&#8217; clustering swarms, <br />
  Companions of the spring-time and the breeze. <br />
  A candid garland set with simple forms <br />
  Her rapid fingers taught a flower song, <br />
  The stanzaed movement of a marriage hymn. <br />
  Profound in perfume and immersed in hue <br />
  They mixed their yearning&#8217;s coloured signs and made <br />
  The bloom of their purity and passion one. <br />
  A sacrament of joy in treasuring palms <br />
  She brought, flower-symbol of her offered life, <br />
  Then with raised hands that trembled a little now <br />
  At the very closeness that her soul desired, <br />
  This bond of sweetness, their bright union&#8217;s sign, <br />
  She laid on the bosom coveted by her love.</p>

<p>As if inclined before some gracious god <br />
  Who has out of his mist of greatness shone <br />
  To fill with beauty his adorer&#8217;s hours, <br />
  She bowed and touched his feet with worshipping hands; <br />
  She made her life his world for him to tread <br />
  And made her body the room of his delight, <br />
  Her beating heart a remembrancer of bliss. <br />
  He bent to her and took into his own <br />
  Their married yearning joined like folded hopes; <br />
  As if a whole rich world suddenly possessed, <br />
  Wedded to all he had been, became himself, <br />

  Around her his embrace became the sign <br />
  Of a locked closeness through slow intimate years, <br />
  A first sweet summary of delight to come, <br />
  One brevity intense of all long life. <br />
  In a wide moment of two souls that meet <br />
  She felt her being flow into him as in waves <br />
  A river pours into a mighty sea. <br />
  As when a soul is merging into God <br />
  To live in Him for ever and know His joy, <br />
  Her consciousness grew aware of him alone <br />
  And all her separate self was lost in his. <br />
  As a starry heaven encircles happy earth, <br />
  He shut her into himself in a circle of bliss <br />

  A boundless isolation made them one; <br />

  As the mortal wakes into Eternity, <br />
  As the finite opens to the Infinite. <br />
  Thus were they in each other lost awhile, <br />

  Adorned with creepers and red climbing flowers <br />

  Slumbering with brown body and tumbled hair <br />
  In her chamber inviolate of emerald peace. <br />
  Around it stretched the forest&#8217;s anchorite mood <br />
  Lost in the depths of its own solitude. <br />
  Then moved by the deep joy she could not speak, <br />
  A little depth of it quivering in her words, <br />
  Her happy voice cried out to Satyavan: <br />
  &#8220;My heart will stay here on this forest verge</p>
