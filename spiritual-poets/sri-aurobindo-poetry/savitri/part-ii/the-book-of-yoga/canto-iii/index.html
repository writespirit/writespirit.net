<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">At first out of the busy hum of mind <br />
  As if from a loud thronged market into a cave <br />
  By an inward moment&#8217;s magic she had come. <br />
  A stark hushed emptiness became her self: <br />
  Her mind unvisited by the voice of thought <br />
  Stared at a void deep&#8217;s dumb infinity. <br />
  Her heights receded, her depths behind her closed; <br />
  All fled away from her and left her blank. <br />
  But when she came back to her self of thought, <br />
  Once more she was a human thing on earth, <br />
  A lump of Matter, a house of closed sight, <br />
  A mind compelled to think out ignorance, <br />
  A life-force pressed into a camp of works <br />
  And the material world her limiting field. <br />
  Amazed like one unknowing she sought her way <br />
  Out of the tangle of man&#8217;s ignorant past <br />
  That took the surface person for the soul. <br />
  Then a Voice spoke that dwelt on secret heights: <br />
  &#8220;For man thou seekst, not for thyself alone. <br />
  Only if God assumes the human mind <br />
  And puts on mortal ignorance for his cloak <br />
  And makes himself the Dwarf with triple stride, <br />
  Can he help man to grow into the God. <br />
  As man disguised the cosmic Greatness works <br />
  And finds the mystic inaccessible gate <br />
  And opens the Immortal&#8217;s golden door. <br />
  Man, human, follows in God&#8217;s human steps. <br />
  Accepting his darkness thou must bring to him light, <br />
  Accepting his sorrow thou must bring to him bliss. <br />
  In Matter&#8217;s body find thy heaven-born soul.&#8221; <br />
  Then Savitri surged out of her body&#8217;s wall</td>

<p>And stood a little span outside herself <br />
  And looked into her subtle being&#8217;s depths <br />
  And in its heart as in a lotus-bud <br />
  Divined her secret and mysterious soul. <br />
  At the dim portal of the inner life <br />
  That bars out from our depths the body&#8217;s mind <br />
  And all that lives but by the body&#8217;s breath, <br />
  She knocked and pressed against the ebony gate. <br />
  The living portal groaned with sullen hinge: <br />
  Heavily reluctant it complained inert <br />
  Against the tyranny of the spirit&#8217;s touch. <br />
  A formidable voice cried from within: <br />
  &#8220;Back, creature of earth, lest tortured and torn thou die.&#8221; <br />
  A dreadful murmur rose like a dim sea; <br />
  The Serpent of the threshold hissing rose, <br />
  A fatal guardian hood with monstrous coils, <br />
  The hounds of darkness growled with jaws agape, <br />
  And trolls and gnomes and goblins scowled and stared <br />
  And wild beast roarings thrilled the blood with fear <br />
  And menace muttered in a dangerous tongue. <br />
  Unshaken her will pressed on the rigid bars: <br />
  The gate swung wide with a protesting jar, <br />
  The opponent Powers withdrew their dreadful guard; <br />
  Her being entered into the inner worlds. <br />
  In a narrow passage, the subconscient&#8217;s gate, <br />
  She breathed with difficulty and pain and strove <br />
  To find the inner self concealed in sense. <br />
  Into a dense of subtle Matter packed, <br />
  A cavity filled with a blind mass of power, <br />
  An opposition of misleading gleams, <br />
  A heavy barrier of unseeing sight, <br />
  She forced her way through body to the soul. <br />
  Across a perilous border line she passed <br />
  Where Life dips into the subconscient dusk <br />
  Or struggles from Matter into chaos of mind, <br />
  Aswarm with elemental entities</p>

<p>And fluttering shapes of vague half-bodied thought <br />
  And crude beginnings of incontinent force. <br />
  At first a difficult narrowness was there, <br />
  A press of uncertain powers and drifting wills; <br />
  For all was there but nothing in its place. <br />
  At times an opening came, a door was forced; <br />
  She crossed through spaces of a secret self <br />
  And trod in passages of inner Time. <br />
  At last she broke into a form of things, <br />
  A start of finiteness, a world of sense: <br />
  But all was still confused, nothing self-found. <br />
  Soul was not there but only cries of life. <br />
  A thronged and clamorous air environed her. <br />
  A horde of sounds defied significance, <br />
  A dissonant clash of cries and contrary calls; <br />
  A mob of visions broke across the sight, <br />
  A jostled sequence lacking sense and suite, <br />
  Feelings pushed through a packed and burdened heart, <br />
  Each forced its separate inconsequent way <br />
  But cared for nothing but its ego&#8217;s drive. <br />
  A rally without key of common will, <br />
  Thought stared at thought and pulled at the taut brain <br />
  As if to pluck the reason from its seat <br />
  And cast its corpse into life&#8217;s wayside drain; <br />
  So might forgotten lie in Nature&#8217;s mud <br />
  Abandoned the slain sentinel of the soul. <br />
  So could life&#8217;s power shake from it mind&#8217;s rule, <br />
  Nature renounce the spirit&#8217;s government <br />
  And the bare elemental energies <br />
  Make of the sense a glory of boundless joy, <br />
  A splendour of ecstatic anarchy, <br />
  A revel mighty and mad of utter bliss. <br />
  This was the sense&#8217;s instinct void of soul <br />
  Or when the soul sleeps hidden void of power, <br />
  But now the vital godhead wakes within <br />
  And lifts the life with the Supernal&#8217;s touch.</p>

<p>But how shall come the glory and the flame <br />
  If mind is cast away into the abyss? <br />
  For body without mind has not the light, <br />
  The rapture of spirit sense, the joy of life; <br />
  All then becomes subconscient, tenebrous, <br />
  Inconscience puts its seal on Nature&#8217;s page <br />
  Or else a mad disorder whirls the brain <br />
  Posting along a ravaged nature&#8217;s roads, <br />
  A chaos of disordered impulses <br />
  In which no light can come, no joy, no peace. <br />
  This state now threatened, this she pushed from her. <br />
  As if in a long endless tossing street <br />
  One driven mid a trampling hurrying crowd <br />
  Hour after hour she trod without release <br />
  Holding by her will the senseless meute at bay; <br />
  Out of the dreadful press she dragged her will <br />
  And fixed her thought upon the saviour Name; <br />
  Then all grew still and empty; she was free. <br />
  A large deliverance came, a vast calm space. <br />
  Awhile she moved through a blank tranquillity <br />
  Of naked Light from an invisible sun, <br />
  A void that was a bodiless happiness, <br />
  A blissful vacuum of nameless peace. <br />
  But now a mightier danger&#8217;s front drew near: <br />
  The press of bodily mind, the Inconscient&#8217;s brood <br />
  Of aimless thought and will had fallen from her. <br />
  Approaching loomed a giant head of Life <br />
  Ungoverned by mind or soul, subconscient, vast. <br />
  It tossed all power into a single drive, <br />
  It made its power a might of dangerous seas. <br />
  Into the stillness of her silent self, <br />
  Into the whiteness of its muse of Space <br />
  A spate, a torrent of the speed of Life <br />
  Broke like a wind-lashed driven mob of waves <br />
  Racing on a pale floor of summer sand; <br />
  It drowned its banks, a mountain of climbing waves.</p>

  It cried to her listening spirit as it ran, <br />
  Demanding God&#8217;s submission to chainless Force. <br />
  A deaf force calling to a status dumb, <br />
  A thousand voices in a muted Vast, <br />
  It claimed the heart&#8217;s support for its clutch at joy, <br />
  For its need to act the witness Soul&#8217;s consent, <br />
  For its lust of power her neutral being&#8217;s seal. <br />
  Into the wideness of her watching self <br />

  Its torrent carried the world&#8217;s hopes and fears, <br />
  All life&#8217;s, all Nature&#8217;s dissatisfied hungry cry, <br />
  And the longing all eternity cannot fill. <br />
  It called to the mountain secrecies of the soul <br />
  And the miracle of the never-dying fire, <br />
  It spoke to some first inexpressible ecstasy <br />
  Hidden in the creative beat of Life; <br />
  Out of the nether unseen deeps it tore <br />
  Its lure and magic of disordered bliss, <br />
  Into earth-light poured its maze of tangled charm <br />
  And heady draught of Nature&#8217;s primitive joy <br />
  And the fire and mystery of forbidden delight <br />
  Drunk from the world-libido&#8217;s bottomless well, <br />
  And the honey-sweet poison-wine of lust and death, <br />
  But dreamed a vintage of glory of life&#8217;s gods, <br />
  And felt as celestial rapture&#8217;s golden sting. <br />
  The cycles of the infinity of desire <br />
  And the mystique that made an unrealised world <br />
  Wider than the known and closer than the unknown <br />
  In which hunt for ever the hounds of mind and life, <br />
  Tempted a deep dissatisfied urge within <br />
  To long for the unfulfilled and ever far <br />
  And make this life upon a limiting earth <br />
  A climb towards summits vanishing in the void, <br />
  A search for the glory of the impossible. <br />
  It dreamed of that which never has been known,</p>

  It chased into an Elysian memory <br />
  The charms that flee from the heart&#8217;s soon lost delight; <br />
  It dared the force that slays, the joys that hurt, <br />
  The imaged shape of unaccomplished things <br />
  And the summons to a Circean transmuting dance <br />
  And passion&#8217;s tenancy of the courts of love <br />
  And the wild Beast&#8217;s ramp and romp with Beauty and Life. <br />
  It brought its cry and surge of opposite powers, <br />
  Its moments of the touch of luminous planes, <br />
  Its flame-ascensions and sky-pitched vast attempts, <br />
  Its fiery towers of dream built on the winds, <br />
  Its sinkings towards the darkness and the abyss, <br />
  Its honey of tenderness, its sharp wine of hate, <br />
  Its changes of sun and cloud, of laughter and tears, <br />

  They gave ambrosia&#8217;s taste and poison&#8217;s sting. <br />
  There was an ardour in the gaze of Life <br />
  That saw heaven blue in the grey air of Night: <br />
  The impulses godward soared on passion&#8217;s wings. <br />
  Mind&#8217;s quick-paced thoughts floated from their high necks, <br />
  A glowing splendour as of an irised mane, <br />
  A parure of pure intuition&#8217;s light; <br />
  Its flame-foot gallop they could imitate: <br />
  Mind&#8217;s voices mimicked inspiration&#8217;s stress, <br />
  Its ictus of infallibility, <br />
  Its speed and lightning heaven-leap of the Gods. <br />
  A trenchant blade that shore the nets of doubt, <br />
  Its sword of discernment seemed almost divine. <br />
  Yet all that knowledge was a borrowed sun&#8217;s; <br />

<p>An inner voice could speak the unreal&#8217;s Word; <br />
  Its puissance dangerous and absolute <br />
  Could mingle poison with the wine of God. <br />
  On these high shining backs falsehood could ride; <br />
  Truth lay with delight in error&#8217;s passionate arms <br />
  Gliding downstream in a blithe gilded barge: <br />
  She edged her ray with a magnificent lie. <br />
  Here in Life&#8217;s nether realms all contraries meet; <br />
  Truth stares and does her works with bandaged eyes <br />
  And Ignorance is Wisdom&#8217;s patron here: <br />
  Those galloping hooves in their enthusiast speed <br />
  Could bear to a dangerous intermediate zone <br />
  Where Death walks wearing a robe of deathless Life. <br />
  Or they enter the valley of the wandering Gleam <br />
  Whence, captives or victims of the specious Ray, <br />
  Souls trapped in that region never can escape. <br />
  Agents, not masters, they serve Life&#8217;s desires <br />
  Toiling for ever in the snare of Time. <br />
  Their bodies born out of some Nihil&#8217;s womb <br />
  Ensnare the spirit in the moment&#8217;s dreams, <br />
  Then perish vomiting the immortal soul <br />
  Out of Matter&#8217;s belly into the sink of Nought. <br />
  Yet some uncaught, unslain, can warily pass <br />
  Carrying Truth&#8217;s image in the sheltered heart, <br />
  Pluck Knowledge out of error&#8217;s screening grip, <br />
  Break paths through the blind walls of little self, <br />
  Then travel on to reach a greater life. <br />
  All this streamed past her and seemed to her vision&#8217;s sight <br />
  As if around a high and voiceless isle <br />
  A clamour of waters from far unknown hills <br />
  Swallowed its narrow banks in crowding waves <br />
  And made a hungry world of white wild foam: <br />
  Hastening, a dragon with a million feet, <br />
  Its foam and cry a drunken giant&#8217;s din, <br />
  Tossing a mane of Darkness into God&#8217;s sky, <br />
  It ebbed receding into a distant roar.</p>

  Blue heaven, green earth, partners of Beauty&#8217;s reign, <br />
  Lived as of old, companions in happiness; <br />
  And in the world&#8217;s heart laughed the joy of life. <br />
  All now was still, the soil shone dry and pure. <br />
  Through it all she moved not, plunged not in the vain waves. <br />
  Out of the vastness of the silent self <br />
  Life&#8217;s clamour fled; her spirit was mute and free. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then journeying forward through the self&#8217;s wide hush <br />

  A chain was on her strong insurgent heart. <br />
  Tamed to the modesty of a measured pace, <br />
  She kept no more her vehement stride and rush; <br />
  She had lost the careless majesty of her muse <br />
  And the ample grandeur of her regal force; <br />
  Curbed were her mighty pomps, her splendid waste, <br />
  Sobered the revels of her bacchant play, <br />
  Cut down were her squanderings in desire&#8217;s bazaar, <br />
  Coerced her despot will, her fancy&#8217;s dance, <br />
  A cold stolidity bound the riot of sense. <br />
  A royalty without freedom was her lot; <br />
  The sovereign throned obeyed her ministers: <br />
  Her servants mind and sense governed her house: <br />
  Her spirit&#8217;s bounds they cast in rigid lines <br />
  And guarding with a phalanx of armoured rules <br />
  The reason&#8217;s balanced reign, kept order and peace. <br />
  Her will lived closed in adamant walls of law, <br />
  Coerced was her force by chains that feigned to adorn, <br />
  Imagination was prisoned in a fort, <br />
  Her wanton and licentious favourite; <br />
  Reality&#8217;s poise and reason&#8217;s symmetry <br />
  Were set in its place sentinelled by marshalled facts, <br />
  They gave to the soul for throne a bench of Law, <br />
  For kingdom a small world of rule and line:</p>

  Shrank patterned into a copy-book device. <br />
  The Spirit&#8217;s almighty freedom was not here: <br />
  A schoolman mind had captured life&#8217;s large space, <br />
  But chose to live in bare and paltry rooms <br />
  Parked off from the too vast dangerous universe, <br />
  Fearing to lose its soul in the infinite. <br />

  Or like a high-bred maiden with chaste eyes <br />
  Forbidden to walk unveiled the public ways, <br />
  She must in close secluded chambers move, <br />
  Her feeling in cloisters live or gardened paths. <br />
  Life was consigned to a safe level path, <br />
  It dared not tempt the great and difficult heights <br />
  Or climb to be neighbour to a lonely star <br />
  Or skirt the danger of the precipice <br />
  Or tempt the foam-curled breakers&#8217; perilous laugh, <br />
  Adventure&#8217;s lyrist, danger&#8217;s amateur, <br />

<p>Meet with the heart&#8217;s passion the Adorable <br />

  A chastened epithet in the prose of life, <br />
  She must fill with colour just her sanctioned space, <br />

  Testing the means to a prefigured end, <br />
  Or at the highest pitch some calm Will&#8217;s plan <br />
  Or a strategy of some High Command within <br />
  To conquer the secret treasures of the gods <br />
  Or win for a masked king some glorious world, <br />
  Not a reflex of the spontaneous self, <br />
  An index of the being and its moods, <br />
  A winging of conscious spirit, a sacrament <br />
  Of life&#8217;s communion with the still Supreme <br />
  Or its pure movement on the Eternal&#8217;s road. <br />
  Or else for the body of some high Idea <br />
  A house was built with too close-fitting bricks; <br />
  Action and thought cemented made a wall <br />
  Of small ideals limiting the soul. <br />
  Even meditation mused on a narrow seat; <br />
  And worship turned to an exclusive God, <br />
  To the Universal in a chapel prayed <br />
  Whose doors were shut against the universe; <br />
  Or kneeled to the bodiless Impersonal <br />
  A mind shut to the cry and fire of love: <br />
  A rational religion dried the heart. <br />

  Wrapped in interpretation&#8217;s silken strings: <br />
  A credo sealed up its spiritual sense. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was a quiet country of fixed mind, <br />
  Here life no more was all nor passion&#8217;s voice; <br />

  Admitted by the sanction of the few, <br />
  Adopt thy station of knowledge, thy post in mind, <br />
  Thy ticket of order draw in Life&#8217;s bureau <br />
  And praise thy fate that made thee one of ours. <br />

  Sight&#8217;s deep release, the heart&#8217;s questioning inner voice: <br />

  Can find the single Truth, the eternal Law: <br />
  Untouched they live by hope and doubt and fear. <br />
  Happy are men anchored on fixed belief <br />
  In this uncertain and ambiguous world, <br />
  Or who have planted in the heart&#8217;s rich soil <br />
  One small grain of spiritual certitude. <br />
  Happiest who stand on faith as on a rock. <br />

  None answered in that bright contented world, <br />
  Or only turned on their accustomed way <br />
  Astonished to hear questioning in that air <br />
  Or thoughts that could still turn to the Beyond. <br />
  But some murmured, passers-by from kindred spheres: <br />
  Each by his credo judged the thought she spoke. <br />
  &#8220;Who then is this who knows not that the soul <br />
  Is a least gland or a secretion&#8217;s fault <br />
  Disquieting the sane government of the mind, <br />
  Disordering the function of the brain, <br />

  But others, &#8220;Nay, it is her spirit she seeks. <br />
  A splendid shadow of the name of God, <br />
  A formless lustre from the Ideal&#8217;s realm, <br />
  The Spirit is the Holy Ghost of Mind; <br />

  Each soul is the great Father&#8217;s crucified Son, <br />

  Into dim spiritual somnolence they break <br />

  Ideas that haunt us with their radiant tread, <br />
  Dreams that are hints of unborn Reality, <br />
  Strange goddesses with deep-pooled magical eyes, <br />
  Strong wind-haired gods carrying the harps of hope, <br />

  And the deep mansion of my secret soul.&#8221; <br />
  One answered pointing to a silence dim <br />
  On a remote extremity of sleep <br />
  In some far background of the inner world. <br />
  &#8220;O Savitri, from thy hidden soul we come. <br />
  We are the messengers, the occult gods <br />
  Who help men&#8217;s drab and heavy ignorant lives <br />
  To wake to beauty and the wonder of things <br />
  Touching them with glory and divinity; <br />
  In evil we light the deathless flame of good <br />
  And hold the torch of knowledge on ignorant roads; <br />
  We are thy will and all men&#8217;s will towards Light. <br />
  O human copy and disguise of God <br />
  Who seekst the deity thou keepest hid <br />
  And livest by the Truth thou hast not known, <br />
  Follow the world&#8217;s winding highway to its source. <br />
  There in the silence few have ever reached, <br />
  Thou shalt see the Fire burning on the bare stone <br />
  And the deep cavern of thy secret soul.&#8221; <br />
  Then Savitri following the great winding road <br />
  Came where it dwindled into a narrow path</p>
