  </td>
<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Here from a low and prone and listless ground <br />
  The passion of the first ascent began; <br />
  A moon-bright face in a sombre cloud of hair, <br />
  A Woman sat in a pale lustrous robe. <br />
  A rugged and ragged soil was her bare seat, <br />
  Beneath her feet a sharp and wounding stone. <br />
  A divine pity on the peaks of the world, <br />
  A spirit touched by the grief of all that lives, <br />
  She looked out far and saw from inner mind <br />
  This questionable world of outward things, <br />
  Of false appearances and plausible shapes, <br />
  This dubious cosmos stretched in the ignorant Void, <br />
  The pangs of earth, the toil and speed of the stars <br />
  And the difficult birth and dolorous end of life. <br />
  Accepting the universe as her body of woe, <br />
  The Mother of the seven sorrows bore <br />
  The seven stabs that pierced her bleeding heart: <br />
  The beauty of sadness lingered on her face, <br />
  Her eyes were dim with the ancient stain of tears. <br />
  Her heart was riven with the world&#8217;s agony <br />
  And burdened with the sorrow and struggle in Time, <br />
  An anguished music trailed in her rapt voice. <br />
  Absorbed in a deep compassion&#8217;s ecstasy, <br />
  Lifting the mild ray of her patient gaze, <br />
  In soft sweet training words slowly she spoke: <br />
  &#8220;O Savitri, I am thy secret soul. <br />
  To share the suffering of the world I came, <br />
  I draw my children&#8217;s pangs into my breast. <br />
  I am the nurse of the dolour beneath the stars; <br />
  I am the soul of all who wailing writhe <br />
  Under the ruthless harrow of the Gods.</td>

<p>I am woman, nurse and slave and beaten beast; <br />
  I tend the hands that gave me cruel blows. <br />
  The hearts that spurned my love and zeal I serve; <br />
  I am the courted queen, the pampered doll, <br />
  I am the giver of the bowl of rice, <br />
  I am the worshipped Angel of the House. <br />
  I am in all that suffers and that cries. <br />
  Mine is the prayer that climbs in vain from earth, <br />
  I am traversed by my creatures&#8217; agonies, <br />
  I am the spirit in a world of pain. <br />
  The scream of tortured flesh and tortured hearts <br />
  Fall&#8217;n back on heart and flesh unheard by Heaven <br />
  Has rent with helpless grief and wrath my soul. <br />
  I have seen the peasant burning in his hut, <br />
  I have seen the slashed corpse of the slaughtered child, <br />
  Heard woman&#8217;s cry ravished and stripped and haled <br />
  Amid the bayings of the hell-hound mob, <br />
  I have looked on, I had no power to save. <br />
  I have brought no arm of strength to aid or slay; <br />
  God gave me love, he gave me not his force. <br />
  I have shared the toil of the yoked animal drudge <br />
  Pushed by the goad, encouraged by the whip; <br />
  I have shared the fear-filled life of bird and beast, <br />
  Its long hunt for the day&#8217;s precarious food, <br />
  Its covert slink and crouch and hungry prowl, <br />
  Its pain and terror seized by beak and claw. <br />
  I have shared the daily life of common men, <br />
  Its petty pleasures and its petty cares, <br />
  Its press of troubles and haggard horde of ills, <br />
  Earth&#8217;s trail of sorrow hopeless of relief, <br />
  The unwanted tedious labour without joy, <br />
  And the burden of misery and the strokes of fate. <br />
  I have been pity, leaning over pain <br />
  And the tender smile that heals the wounded heart <br />
  And sympathy making life less hard to bear. <br />
  Man has felt near my unseen face and hands;</p>

<p>I have become the sufferer and his moan, <br />
  I have lain down with the mangled and the slain, <br />
  I have lived with the prisoner in his dungeon cell. <br />
  Heavy on my shoulders weighs the yoke of Time: <br />
  Nothing refusing of creation&#8217;s load, <br />
  I have borne all and know I still must bear: <br />
  Perhaps when the world sinks into a last sleep, <br />
  I too may sleep in dumb eternal peace. <br />
  I have borne the calm indifference of Heaven, <br />
  Watched Nature&#8217;s cruelty to suffering things <br />
  While God passed silent by nor turned to help. <br />
  Yet have I cried not out against his will, <br />
  Yet have I not accused his cosmic Law. <br />
  Only to change this great hard world of pain <br />
  A patient prayer has risen from my breast; <br />
  A pallid resignation lights my brow, <br />
  Within me a blind faith and mercy dwell; <br />
  I carry the fire that never can be quenched <br />
  And the compassion that supports the suns. <br />
  I am the hope that looks towards my God, <br />
  My God who never came to me till now; <br />
  His voice I hear that ever says `I come&#8217;: <br />
  I know that one day he shall come at last.&#8221; <br />
  She ceased, and like an echo from below <br />
  Answering her pathos of divine complaint <br />
  A voice of wrath took up the dire refrain, <br />
  A growl of thunder or roar of angry beast, <br />
  The beast that crouching growls within man&#8217;s depths,&#8211; <br />
  Voice of a tortured Titan once a God. <br />
  &#8220;I am the Man of Sorrows, I am he <br />
  Who is nailed on the wide cross of the universe; <br />
  To enjoy my agony God built the earth, <br />
  My passion he has made his drama&#8217;s theme. <br />
  He has sent me naked into his bitter world <br />
  And beaten me with his rods of grief and pain <br />
  That I might cry and grovel at his feet</p>

  I toil like the animal, like the animal die. <br />
  I am man the rebel, man the helpless serf; <br />
  Fate and my fellows cheat me of my wage. <br />
  I loosen with my blood my servitude&#8217;s seal <br />
  And shake from my aching neck the oppressor&#8217;s knees <br />
  Only to seat new tyrants on my back: <br />
  My teachers lesson me in slavery, <br />
  I am shown God&#8217;s stamp and my own signature <br />
  Upon the sorry contract of my fate. <br />
  I have loved, but none has loved me since my birth; <br />
  My fruit of works is given to other hands. <br />
  All that is left me is my evil thoughts, <br />
  My sordid quarrel against God and man, <br />
  Envy of the riches that I cannot share, <br />
  Hate of a happiness that is not mine. <br />
  I know my fate will ever be the same, <br />
  It is my nature&#8217;s work that cannot change: <br />
  I have loved for mine, not for the beloved&#8217;s sake, <br />
  I have lived for myself and not for others&#8217; lives. <br />
  Each in himself is sole by Nature&#8217;s law. <br />
  So God has made his harsh and dreadful world, <br />
  So has he built the petty heart of man. <br />
  Only by force and ruse can man survive: <br />
  For pity is a weakness in his breast, <br />
  His goodness is a laxity in the nerves,</p>

  His altruism is ego&#8217;s other face: <br />
  He serves the world that him the world may serve. <br />
  If once the Titan&#8217;s strength could wake in me, <br />
  If Enceladus from Etna could arise, <br />
  I then would reign the master of the world <br />
  And like a god enjoy man&#8217;s bliss and pain. <br />
  But God has taken from me the ancient Force. <br />
  There is a dull consent in my sluggish heart, <br />
  A fierce satisfaction with my special pangs <br />
  As if they made me taller than my kind; <br />
  Only by suffering can I excel. <br />
  I am the victim of titanic ills, <br />
  I am the doer of demoniac deeds; <br />
  I was made for evil, evil is my lot; <br />
  Evil I must be and by evil live; <br />
  Nought other can I do but be myself; <br />
  What Nature made me, that I must remain. <br />
  I suffer and toil and weep; I moan and hate.&#8221; <br />
  And Savitri heard the voice, the echo heard <br />
  And turning to her being of pity spoke: <br />
  &#8220;Madonna of suffering, Mother of grief divine, <br />
  Thou art a portion of my soul put forth <br />
  To bear the unbearable sorrow of the world. <br />
  Because thou art, men yield not to their doom, <br />
  But ask for happiness and strive with fate; <br />
  Because thou art, the wretched still can hope. <br />
  But thine is the power to solace, not to save. <br />
  One day I will return, a bringer of strength, <br />
  And make thee drink from the Eternal&#8217;s cup; <br />
  His streams of force shall triumph in thy limbs <br />
  And Wisdom&#8217;s calm control thy passionate heart. <br />
  Thy love shall be the bond of humankind, <br />
  Compassion the bright key of Nature&#8217;s acts: <br />
  Misery shall pass abolished from the earth; <br />
  The world shall be freed from the anger of the Beast,</p>

  There shall be peace and joy for ever more.&#8221; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On passed she in her spirit&#8217;s upward route. <br />
  An ardent grandeur climbed mid ferns and rocks, <br />
  A quiet wind flattered the heart to warmth, <br />
  A finer perfume breathed from slender trees. <br />
  All beautiful grew, subtle and high and strange. <br />
  Here on a boulder carved like a huge throne <br />
  A Woman sat in gold and purple sheen, <br />
  Armed with the trident and the thunderbolt, <br />
  Her feet upon a couchant lion&#8217;s back. <br />
  A formidable smile curved round her lips, <br />
  Heaven-fire laughed in the corners of her eyes; <br />
  Her body a mass of courage and heavenly strength, <br />
  She menaced the triumph of the nether gods. <br />
  A halo of lightnings flamed around her head <br />
  And sovereignty, a great cestus, zoned her robe <br />
  And majesty and victory sat with her <br />
  Guarding in the wide cosmic battlefield <br />
  Against the flat equality of Death <br />
  And the all-levelling insurgent Night <br />
  The hierarchy of the ordered Powers, <br />
  The high changeless values, the peaked eminences, <br />
  The privileged aristocracy of Truth, <br />
  And in the governing Ideal&#8217;s sun <br />
  The triumvirate of wisdom, love and bliss <br />
  And the sole autocracy of the absolute Light. <br />
  August on her seat in the inner world of Mind, <br />
  The Mother of Might looked down on passing things, <br />
  Listened to the advancing tread of Time, <br />
  Saw the irresistible wheeling of the suns <br />
  And heard the thunder of the march of God. <br />
  Amid the swaying Forces in their strife <br />
  Sovereign was her word of luminous command, <br />
  Her speech like a war-cry rang or a pilgrim chant.</p>

<p>A charm restoring hope in failing hearts <br />

  &#8220;O Savitri, I am thy secret soul. <br />
  I have come down into the human world <br />
  And the movement watched by an unsleeping Eye <br />
  And the dark contrariety of earth&#8217;s fate <br />
  And the battle of the bright and sombre Powers. <br />
  I stand upon earth&#8217;s paths of danger and grief <br />
  And help the unfortunate and save the doomed. <br />
  To the strong I bring the guerdon of their strength, <br />
  To the weak I bring the armour of my force; <br />
  To men who long I carry their coveted joy: <br />
  I am fortune justifying the great and wise <br />
  By the sanction of the plaudits of the crowd, <br />
  Then trampling them with the armed heel of fate. <br />
  My ear is leaned to the cry of the oppressed, <br />
  I topple down the thrones of tyrant kings: <br />
  A cry comes from proscribed and hunted lives <br />
  Appealing to me against a pitiless world, <br />
  A voice of the forsaken and desolate <br />
  And the lone prisoner in his dungeon cell. <br />
  Men hail in my coming the Almighty&#8217;s force <br />
  Or praise with thankful tears his saviour Grace. <br />
  I smite the Titan who bestrides the world <br />
  And slay the ogre in his blood-stained den. <br />
  I am Durga, goddess of the proud and strong, <br />
  And Lakshmi, queen of the fair and fortunate; <br />
  I wear the face of Kali when I kill, <br />
  I trample the corpses of the demon hordes. <br />
  I am charged by God to do his mighty work, <br />
  Uncaring I serve his will who sent me forth, <br />
  Reckless of peril and earthly consequence. <br />
  I reason not of virtue and of sin <br />
  But do the deed he has put into my heart. <br />
  I fear not for the angry frown of Heaven, <br />
  I flinch not from the red assault of Hell;</p>

<p>I crush the opposition of the gods, <br />
  Tread down a million goblin obstacles. <br />
  I guide man to the path of the Divine <br />
  And guard him from the red Wolf and the Snake. <br />
  I set in his mortal hand my heavenly sword <br />
  And put on him the breastplate of the gods. <br />
  I break the ignorant pride of human mind <br />
  And lead the thought to the wideness of the Truth; <br />
  I rend man&#8217;s narrow and successful life <br />
  And force his sorrowful eyes to gaze at the sun <br />
  That he may die to earth and live in his soul. <br />
  I know the goal, I know the secret route; <br />
  I have studied the map of the invisible worlds; <br />
  I am the battle&#8217;s head, the journey&#8217;s star. <br />
  But the great obstinate world resists my Word, <br />
  And the crookedness and evil in man&#8217;s heart <br />
  Is stronger than Reason, profounder than the Pit, <br />
  And the malignancy of hostile Powers <br />
  Puts craftily back the clock of destiny <br />
  And mightier seems than the eternal Will. <br />
  The cosmic evil is too deep to unroot, <br />
  The cosmic suffering is too vast to heal. <br />
  A few I guide who pass me towards the Light; <br />
  A few I save, the mass falls back unsaved; <br />
  A few I help, the many strive and fail. <br />
  But my heart I have hardened and I do my work: <br />
  Slowly the light grows greater in the East, <br />
  Slowly the world progresses on God&#8217;s road. <br />
  His seal is on my task, it cannot fail: <br />
  I shall hear the silver swing of heaven&#8217;s gates <br />
  When God comes out to meet the soul of the world.&#8221; <br />
  She spoke and from the lower human world <br />
  An answer, a warped echo met her speech; <br />
  The voice came through the spaces of the mind <br />
  Of the dwarf-Titan, the deformed chained god <br />
  Who strives to master his nature&#8217;s rebel stuff</p>

  Claimed earth and the wide heavens for the use <br />
  Of man, head of the life it shapes on earth, <br />
  Its representative and conscious soul, <br />
  And symbol of evolving light and force <br />
  And vessel of the godhead that must be. <br />
  A thinking animal, Nature&#8217;s struggling lord, <br />

  And pays to her as wage and emolument <br />
  Inescapably by a deep law in things <br />
  His heart&#8217;s grief and his body&#8217;s death and pain: <br />
  His pains are her means to grow, to see and feel; <br />
  His death assists her immortality. <br />
  A tool and slave of his own slave and tool, <br />
  He praises his free will and his master mind <br />
  And is pushed by her upon her chosen paths; <br />
  Possessor he is possessed and, ruler, ruled, <br />

  The last-born of the earth I stand the first; <br />
  Her slow millenniums waited for my birth. <br />
  Although I live in Time besieged by Death, <br />
  Precarious owner of my body and soul <br />
  Housed on a little speck amid the stars, <br />
  For me and my use the universe was made. <br />
  Immortal spirit in the perishing clay, <br />
  I am God still unevolved in human form; <br />
  Even if he is not, he becomes in me.</p>

  I have come down to the wounded desolate earth <br />
  To heal her pangs and lull her heart to rest <br />
  And lay her head upon the Mother&#8217;s lap <br />
  That she may dream of God and know his peace <br />
  And draw the harmony of higher spheres <br />

  I show to her the figures of bright gods <br />

  I am peace that steals into man&#8217;s war-worn breast, <br />
  Amid the reign of Hell his acts create <br />
  A hostel where Heaven&#8217;s messengers can lodge; <br />
  I am charity with the kindly hands that bless, <br />
  I am silence mid the noisy tramp of life; <br />
  I am Knowledge poring on her cosmic map. <br />
  In the anomalies of the human heart <br />
  Where Good and Evil are close bedfellows <br />
  And Light is by Darkness dogged at every step, <br />
  Where his largest knowledge is an ignorance, <br />
  I am the Power that labours towards the best <br />
  And works for God and looks up towards the heights. <br />
  I make even sin and error stepping-stones <br />
  And all experience a long march towards Light. <br />
  Out of the Inconscient I build consciousness, <br />
  And lead through death to reach immortal Life. <br />
  Many are God&#8217;s forms by which he grows in man; <br />
  They stamp his thoughts and deeds with divinity, <br />
  Uplift the stature of the human clay <br />
  Or slowly transmute it into heaven&#8217;s gold. <br />
  He is the Good for which men fight and die, <br />
  He is the war of Right with Titan wrong; <br />
  He is Freedom rising deathless from her pyre; <br />
  He is Valour guarding still the desperate pass <br />
  Or lone and erect on the shattered barricade</p>

  Only when infinity weds the finite&#8217;s thought, <br />
  Can man be free from himself and live with God. <br />
  I bring meanwhile the gods upon the earth; <br />
  I bring back hope to the despairing heart; <br />
  I give peace to the humble and the great, <br />
  And shed my grace on the foolish and the wise. <br />
  I shall save earth, if earth consents to be saved. <br />
  Then Love shall at last unwounded tread earth&#8217;s soil; <br />
  Man&#8217;s mind shall admit the sovereignty of Truth <br />
  And body bear the immense descent of God.&#8221; <br />
  She spoke and from the ignorant nether plane <br />
  A cry, a warped echo naked and shuddering came. <br />
  A voice of the sense-shackled human mind</p>

<p>Carried its proud complaint of godlike power <br />
  Hedged by the limits of a mortal&#8217;s thoughts, <br />
  Bound in the chains of earthly ignorance. <br />
  Imprisoned in his body and his brain <br />
  The mortal cannot see God&#8217;s mighty whole, <br />
  Or share in his vast and deep identity <br />
  Who stands unguessed within our ignorant hearts <br />
  And knows all things because he is one with all. <br />
  Man only sees the cosmic surfaces. <br />
  Then wondering what may lie hid from the sense <br />
  A little way he delves to depths below: <br />
  But soon he stops, he cannot reach life&#8217;s core <br />
  Or commune with the throbbing heart of things. <br />
  He sees the naked body of the Truth <br />
  Though often baffled by her endless garbs, <br />
  But cannot look upon her soul within. <br />
  Then, furious for a knowledge absolute, <br />
  He tears all details out and stabs and digs: <br />
  Only the shape&#8217;s contents he holds for use; <br />
  The spirit escapes or dies beneath his knife. <br />
  He sees as a blank stretch, a giant waste <br />
  The crowding riches of infinity. <br />
  The finite he has made his central field, <br />
  Its plan dissects, masters its processes, <br />
  That which moves all is hidden from his gaze, <br />
  His poring eyes miss the unseen behind. <br />
  He has the blind man&#8217;s subtle unerring touch <br />
  Or the slow traveller&#8217;s sight of distant scenes; <br />
  The soul&#8217;s revealing contacts are not his. <br />
  Yet is he visited by intuitive light <br />
  And inspiration comes from the Unknown; <br />
  But only reason and sense he feels as sure, <br />
  They only are his trusted witnesses. <br />
  Thus is he baulked, his splendid effort vain; <br />
  His knowledge scans bright pebbles on the shore <br />
  Of the huge ocean of his ignorance.</p>

<p>Yet grandiose were the accents of that cry, <br />
  A cosmic pathos trembled in its tone. <br />
  &#8220;I am the mind of God&#8217;s great ignorant world <br />
  Ascending to knowledge by the steps he made; <br />
  I am the all-discovering Thought of man. <br />
  I am a god fettered by Matter and sense, <br />
  An animal prisoned in a fence of thorns, <br />
  A beast of labour asking for his food, <br />
  A smith tied to his anvil and his forge. <br />
  Yet have I loosened the cord, enlarged my room. <br />
  I have mapped the heavens and analysed the stars, <br />
  Described their orbits through the grooves of Space, <br />
  Measured the miles that separate the suns, <br />
  Computed their longevity in Time. <br />
  I have delved into earth&#8217;s bowels and torn out <br />
  The riches guarded by her dull brown soil. <br />
  I have classed the changes of her stony crust <br />
  And of her biography discovered the dates, <br />
  Rescued the pages of all Nature&#8217;s plan. <br />
  The tree of evolution I have sketched, <br />
  Each branch and twig and leaf in its own place, <br />
  In the embryo tracked the history of forms, <br />
  And the genealogy framed of all that lives. <br />
  I have detected plasm and cell and gene, <br />
  The protozoa traced, man&#8217;s ancestors, <br />
  The humble originals from whom he rose; <br />
  I know how he was born and how he dies: <br />
  Only what end he serves I know not yet <br />
  Or if there is aim at all or any end <br />
  Or push of rich creative purposeful joy <br />
  In the wide works of the terrestrial power. <br />
  I have caught her intricate processes, none is left: <br />
  Her huge machinery is in my hands; <br />
  I have seized the cosmic energies for my use. <br />
  I have pored on her infinitesimal elements <br />
  And her invisible atoms have unmasked:</p>

<p>All Matter is a book I have perused; <br />
  Only some pages now are left to read. <br />
  I have seen the ways of life, the paths of mind; <br />
  I have studied the methods of the ant and ape <br />
  And the behaviour learned of man and worm. <br />
  If God is at work, his secrets I have found. <br />
  But still the Cause of things is left in doubt, <br />
  Their truth flees from pursuit into a void; <br />
  When all has been explained nothing is known. <br />
  What chose the process, whence the Power sprang <br />
  I know not and perhaps shall never know. <br />
  A mystery is this mighty Nature&#8217;s birth; <br />
  A mystery is the elusive stream of mind, <br />
  A mystery the protean freak of life. <br />
  What I have learned, Chance leaps to contradict; <br />
  What I have built is seized and torn by Fate. <br />
  I can foresee the acts of Matter&#8217;s force, <br />
  But not the march of the destiny of man: <br />
  He is driven upon paths he did not choose, <br />
  He falls trampled underneath the rolling wheels. <br />
  My great philosophies are a reasoned guess; <br />
  The mystic heavens that claim the human soul <br />
  Are a charlatanism of the imagining brain: <br />
  All is a speculation or a dream. <br />
  In the end the world itself becomes a doubt: <br />
  The infinitesimal&#8217;s jest mocks mass and shape, <br />
  A laugh peals from the infinite&#8217;s finite mask. <br />
  Perhaps the world is an error of our sight, <br />
  A trick repeated in each flash of sense, <br />
  An unreal mind hallucinates the soul <br />
  With a stress-vision of false reality, <br />
  Or a dance of Maya veils the void Unborn. <br />
  Even if a greater consciousness I could reach, <br />
  What profit is it then for Thought to win <br />
  A Real which is for ever ineffable <br />
  Or hunt to its lair the bodiless Self or make</p>

<p>The Unknowable the target of the soul? <br />
  Nay, let me work within my mortal bounds, <br />
  Not live beyond life nor think beyond the mind; <br />
  Our smallness saves us from the Infinite. <br />
  In a frozen grandeur lone and desolate <br />
  Call me not to die the great eternal death, <br />
  Left naked of my own humanity <br />
  In the chill vast of the spirit&#8217;s boundlessness. <br />
  Each creature by its nature&#8217;s limits lives, <br />
  And how can one evade his native fate? <br />
  Human I am, human let me remain <br />
  Till in the Inconscient I fall dumb and sleep. <br />
  A high insanity, a chimaera is this, <br />
  To think that God lives hidden in the clay <br />
  And that eternal Truth can dwell in Time, <br />
  And call to her to save our self and world. <br />
  How can man grow immortal and divine <br />
  Transmuting the very stuff of which he is made? <br />
  This wizard gods may dream, not thinking men.&#8221; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And Savitri heard the voice, the warped answer heard <br />
  And turning to her being of light she spoke: <br />
  &#8220;Madonna of light, Mother of joy and peace, <br />
  Thou art a portion of my self put forth <br />
  To raise the spirit to its forgotten heights <br />
  And wake the soul by touches of the heavens. <br />
  Because thou art, the soul draws near to God; <br />
  Because thou art, love grows in spite of hate <br />
  And knowledge walks unslain in the pit of Night. <br />
  But not by showering heaven&#8217;s golden rain <br />
  Upon the intellect&#8217;s hard and rocky soil <br />
  Can the tree of Paradise flower on earthly ground <br />
  And the Bird of Paradise sit upon life&#8217;s boughs <br />
  And the winds of Paradise visit mortal air. <br />
  Even if thou rain down intuition&#8217;s rays, <br />
  The mind of man will think it earth&#8217;s own gleam, <br />
  His spirit by spiritual ego sink,</p>
