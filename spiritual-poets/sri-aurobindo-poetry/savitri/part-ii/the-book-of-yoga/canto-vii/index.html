<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">In the little hermitage in the forest&#8217;s heart, <br />
  In the sunlight and the moonlight and the dark <br />
  The daily human life went plodding on <br />
  Even as before with its small unchanging works <br />
  And its spare outward body of routine <br />
  And happy quiet of ascetic peace. <br />
  The old beauty smiled of the terrestrial scene; <br />
  She too was her old gracious self to men. <br />
  The Ancient Mother clutched her child to her breast <br />
  Pressing her close in her environing arms, <br />
  As if earth ever the same could for ever keep <br />
  The living spirit and body in her clasp, <br />
  As if death were not there nor end nor change. <br />
  Accustomed only to read outward signs <br />
  None saw aught new in her, none divined her state; <br />
  They saw a person where was only God&#8217;s vast, <br />
  A still being or a mighty nothingness. <br />
  To all she was the same perfect Savitri: <br />
  A greatness and a sweetness and a light <br />
  Poured out from her upon her little world. <br />
  Life showed to all the same familiar face, <br />
  Her acts followed the old unaltered round, <br />
  She spoke the words that she was wont to speak <br />
  And did the things that she had always done. <br />
  Her eyes looked out on earth&#8217;s unchanging face, <br />
  Around her soul&#8217;s muteness all moved as of old; <br />
  A vacant consciousness watched from within, <br />
  Empty of all but bare Reality. <br />
  There was no will behind the word and act, <br />
  No thought formed in her brain to guide the speech:</td>

<p>An impersonal emptiness walked and spoke in her, <br />
  Something perhaps unfelt, unseen, unknown <br />
  Guarded the body for its future work, <br />
  Or Nature moved in her old stream of force. <br />
  Perhaps she bore made conscious in her breast <br />
  The miraculous Nihil, origin of our souls <br />
  And source and sum of the vast world&#8217;s events, <br />
  The womb and grave of thought, a cipher of God, <br />
  A zero circle of being&#8217;s totality. <br />
  It used her speech and acted in her acts, <br />
  It was beauty in her limbs, life in her breath; <br />
  The original Mystery wore her human face. <br />
  Thus was she lost within to separate self; <br />
  Her mortal ego perished in God&#8217;s night. <br />
  Only a body was left, the ego&#8217;s shell <br />
  Afloat mid drift and foam of the world-sea, <br />
  A sea of dream watched by a motionless sense <br />
  In a figure of unreal reality. <br />
  An impersonal foresight could already see,&#8211; <br />
  In the unthinking knowledge of the spirit <br />
  Even now it seemed nigh done, inevitable,&#8211; <br />
  The individual die, the cosmos pass; <br />
  These gone, the transcendental grew a myth, <br />
  The Holy Ghost without the Father and Son, <br />
  Or, a substratum of what once had been, <br />
  Being that never willed to bear a world <br />
  Restored to its original loneliness, <br />
  Impassive, sole, silent, intangible. <br />
  Yet all was not extinct in this deep loss; <br />
  The being travelled not towards nothingness. <br />
  There was some high surpassing Secrecy, <br />
  And when she sat alone with Satyavan, <br />
  Her moveless mind with his that searched and strove, <br />
  In the hush of the profound and intimate night <br />
  She turned to the face of a veiled voiceless Truth <br />
  Hid in the dumb recesses of the heart</p>

<p>Or waiting beyond the last peak climbed by Thought,&#8211; <br />
  Unseen itself it sees the struggling world <br />
  And prompts our quest, but cares not to be found,&#8211; <br />
  Out of that distant Vast came a reply. <br />
  Something unknown, unreached, inscrutable <br />
  Sent down the messages of its bodiless Light, <br />
  Cast lightning flashes of a thought not ours <br />
  Crossing the immobile silence of her mind: <br />
  In its might of irresponsible sovereignty <br />
  It seized on speech to give those flamings shape, <br />
  Made beat the heart of wisdom in a word <br />
  And spoke immortal things through mortal lips. <br />
  Or, listening to the sages of the woods, <br />
  In question and in answer broke from her <br />
  High strange revealings impossible to men, <br />
  Something or someone secret and remote <br />
  Took hold of her body for his mystic use, <br />
  Her mouth was seized to channel ineffable truths, <br />
  Knowledge unthinkable found an utterance. <br />
  Astonished by a new enlightenment, <br />
  Invaded by a streak of the Absolute, <br />
  They marvelled at her, for she seemed to know <br />
  What they had only glimpsed at times afar. <br />
  These thoughts were formed not in her listening brain, <br />
  Her vacant heart was like a stringless harp; <br />
  Impassive the body claimed not its own voice, <br />
  But let the luminous greatness through it pass. <br />
  A dual Power at being&#8217;s occult poles <br />
  Still acted, nameless and invisible: <br />
  Her divine emptiness was their instrument. <br />
  Inconscient Nature dealt with the world it had made, <br />
  And using still the body&#8217;s instruments <br />
  Slipped through the conscious void she had become; <br />
  The superconscient Mystery through that Void <br />
  Missioned its word to touch the thoughts of men. <br />
  As yet this great impersonal speech was rare.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">But now the unmoving wide spiritual space <br />
  In which her mind survived tranquil and bare, <br />
  Admitted a traveller from the cosmic breadths: <br />
  A thought came through draped as an outer voice. <br />
  It called not for the witness of the mind, <br />
  It spoke not to the hushed receiving heart; <br />
  It came direct to the pure perception&#8217;s seat, <br />
  An only centre now of consciousness, <br />
  If centre could be where all seemed only space; <br />
  No more shut in by body&#8217;s walls and gates <br />
  Her being, a circle without circumference, <br />
  Already now surpassed all cosmic bounds <br />
  And more and more spread into infinity. <br />
  This being was its own unbounded world, <br />
  A world without form or feature or circumstance; <br />
  It had no ground, no wall, no roof of thought, <br />
  Yet saw itself and looked on all around <br />
  In a silence motionless and illimitable. <br />
  There was no person there, no centred mind, <br />
  No seat of feeling on which beat events <br />
  Or objects wrought and shaped reaction&#8217;s stress. <br />
  There was no motion in this inner world, <br />
  All was a still and even infinity. <br />
  In her the Unseen, the Unknown waited his hour. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But now she sat by sleeping Satyavan, <br />
  Awake within, and the enormous Night <br />
  Surrounded her with the Unknowable&#8217;s vast. <br />
  A voice began to speak from her own heart <br />
  That was not hers, yet mastered thought and sense. <br />
  As it spoke all changed within her and without; <br />
  All was, all lived; she felt all being one; <br />
  The world of unreality ceased to be: <br />
  There was no more a universe built by mind, <br />
  Convicted as a structure or a sign; <br />
  A spirit, a being saw created things</p>

<p>And cast itself into unnumbered forms <br />
  And was what it saw and made; all now became <br />
  An evidence of one stupendous truth, <br />
  A Truth in which negation had no place, <br />
  A being and a living consciousness, <br />
  A stark and absolute Reality. <br />
  There the unreal could not find a place, <br />
  The sense of unreality was slain: <br />
  There all was conscious, made of the Infinite, <br />
  All had a substance of Eternity. <br />
  Yet this was the same Indecipherable; <br />
  It seemed to cast from it universe like a dream <br />
  Vanishing for ever into an original Void. <br />
  But this was no more some vague ubiquitous point <br />
  Or a cipher of vastness in unreal Nought. <br />
  It was the same but now no more seemed far <br />
  To the living clasp of her recovered soul. <br />
  It was her self, it was the self of all, <br />
  It was the reality of existing things, <br />
  It was the consciousness of all that lived <br />
  And felt and saw; it was Timelessness and Time, <br />
  It was the Bliss of formlessness and form. <br />
  It was all Love and the one Beloved&#8217;s arms, <br />
  It was sight and thought in one all-seeing Mind, <br />
  It was joy of Being on the peaks of God. <br />
  She passed beyond Time into eternity, <br />
  Slipped out of space and became the Infinite; <br />
  Her being rose into unreachable heights <br />
  And found no end of its journey in the Self. <br />
  It plunged into the unfathomable deeps <br />
  And found no end to the silent mystery <br />
  That held all world within one lonely breast, <br />
  Yet harboured all creation&#8217;s multitudes. <br />
  She was all vastness and one measureless point, <br />
  She was a height beyond heights, a depth beyond depths, <br />
  She lived in the everlasting and was all</p>

<p>That harbours death and bears the wheeling hours. <br />
  All contraries were true in one huge spirit <br />
  Surpassing measure, change and circumstance. <br />
  An individual, one with cosmic self <br />
  In the heart of the Transcendent&#8217;s miracle <br />
  And the secret of World-personality <br />
  Was the creator and the lord of all. <br />
  Mind was a single innumerable look <br />
  Upon himself and all that he became. <br />
  Life was his drama and the Vast a stage, <br />
  The universe was his body, God its soul. <br />
  All was one single immense reality, <br />
  All its innumerable phenomenon. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Her spirit saw the world as living God; <br />
  It saw the One and knew that all was He. <br />
  She knew him as the Absolute&#8217;s self-space, <br />
  One with her self and ground of all things here <br />
  In which the world wanders seeking for the Truth <br />
  Guarded behind its face of ignorance: <br />
  She followed him through the march of endless Time. <br />
  All Nature&#8217;s happenings were events in her, <br />
  The heart-beats of the cosmos were her own, <br />
  All beings thought and felt and moved in her; <br />
  She inhabited the vastness of the world, <br />
  Its distances were her nature&#8217;s boundaries, <br />
  Its closenesses her own life&#8217;s intimacies. <br />
  Her mind became familiar with its mind, <br />
  Its body was her body&#8217;s larger frame <br />
  In which she lived and knew herself in it <br />
  One, multitudinous in its multitudes. <br />
  She was a single being, yet all things; <br />
  The world was her spirit&#8217;s wide circumference, <br />
  The thoughts of others were her intimates, <br />
  Their feelings close to her universal heart, <br />
  Their bodies her many bodies kin to her; <br />
  She was no more herself but all the world.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Out of the infinitudes all came to her, <br />
  Into the infinitudes sentient she spread, <br />
  Infinity was her own natural home. <br />
  Nowhere she dwelt, her spirit was everywhere, <br />
  The distant constellations wheeled round her; <br />
  Earth saw her born, all worlds were her colonies, <br />
  The greater worlds of life and mind were hers; <br />
  All Nature reproduced her in its lines, <br />
  Its movements were large copies of her own. <br />
  She was the single self of all these selves, <br />
  She was in them and they were all in her. <br />
  This first was an immense identity <br />
  In which her own identity was lost: <br />
  What seemed herself was an image of the Whole. <br />
  She was a subconscient life of tree and flower, <br />
  The outbreak of the honied buds of spring; <br />
  She burned in the passion and splendour of the rose, <br />
  She was the red heart of the passion-flower, <br />
  The dream-white of the lotus in its pool. <br />
  Out of subconscient life she climbed to mind, <br />
  She was thought and the passion of the world&#8217;s heart, <br />
  She was the godhead hid in the heart of man, <br />
  She was the climbing of his soul to God. <br />
  The cosmos flowered in her, she was its bed. <br />
  She was Time and the dreams of God in Time; <br />
  She was Space and the wideness of his days. <br />
  From this she rose where Time and Space were not; <br />
  The superconscient was her native air, <br />
  Infinity was her movement&#8217;s natural space; <br />
  Eternity looked out from her on Time. </p>
