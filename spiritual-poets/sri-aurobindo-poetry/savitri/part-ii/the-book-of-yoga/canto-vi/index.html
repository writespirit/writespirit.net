<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A calm slow sun looked down from tranquil heavens. <br />
  A routed sullen rearguard of retreat, <br />
  The last rains had fled murmuring across the woods <br />
  Or failed, a sibilant whisper mid the leaves, <br />
  And the great blue enchantment of the sky <br />
  Recovered the deep rapture of its smile. <br />
  Its mellow splendour unstressed by storm-licked heats <br />
  Found room for a luxury of warm mild days, <br />
  The night&#8217;s gold treasure of autumnal moons <br />
  Came floating shipped through ripples of faery air. <br />
  And Savitri&#8217;s life was glad, fulfilled like earth&#8217;s; <br />
  She had found herself, she knew her being&#8217;s aim. <br />
  Although her kingdom of marvellous change within <br />
  Remained unspoken in her secret breast, <br />
  All that lived round her felt its magic&#8217;s charm: <br />
  The trees&#8217; rustling voices told it to the winds, <br />
  Flowers spoke in ardent hues an unknown joy, <br />
  The birds&#8217; carolling became a canticle, <br />
  The beasts forgot their strife and lived at ease. <br />
  Absorbed in wide communion with the Unseen <br />
  The mild ascetics of the wood received <br />
  A sudden greatening of their lonely muse. <br />
  This bright perfection of her inner state <br />
  Poured overflowing into her outward scene, <br />
  Made beautiful dull common natural things <br />
  And action wonderful and time divine. <br />
  Even the smallest meanest work became <br />
  A sweet or glad and glorious sacrament, <br />
  An offering to the self of the great world <br />
  Or a service to the One in each and all.</td>

<p>A light invaded all from her being&#8217;s light; <br />
  Her heart-beats&#8217; dance communicated bliss: <br />
  Happiness grew happier, shared with her, by her touch <br />
  And grief some solace found when she drew near. <br />
  Above the cherished head of Satyavan <br />
  She saw not now Fate&#8217;s dark and lethal orb; <br />
  A golden circle round a mystic sun <br />
  Disclosed to her new-born predicting sight <br />
  The cyclic rondure of a sovereign life. <br />
  In her visions and deep-etched veridical dreams, <br />
  In brief shiftings of the future&#8217;s heavy screen, <br />
  He lay not by a dolorous decree <br />
  A victim in the dismal antre of death <br />
  Or borne to blissful regions far from her <br />
  Forgetting the sweetness of earth&#8217;s warm delight, <br />
  Forgetting the passionate oneness of love&#8217;s clasp, <br />
  Absolved in the self-rapt immortal&#8217;s bliss. <br />
  Always he was with her, a living soul <br />
  That met her eyes with close enamoured eyes, <br />
  A living body near to her body&#8217;s joy. <br />
  But now no longer in these great wild woods <br />
  In kinship with the days of bird and beast <br />
  And levelled to the bareness of earth&#8217;s brown breast, <br />
  But mid the thinking high-built lives of men <br />
  In tapestried chambers and on crystal floors, <br />
  In armoured town or gardened pleasure-walks, <br />
  Even in distance closer than her thoughts, <br />
  Body to body near, soul near to soul, <br />
  Moving as if by a common breath and will <br />
  They were tied in the single circling of their days <br />
  Together by love&#8217;s unseen atmosphere, <br />
  Inseparable like the earth and sky. <br />
  Thus for a while she trod the Golden Path; <br />
  This was the sun before abysmal Night. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Once as she sat in deep felicitous muse, <br />
  Still quivering from her lover&#8217;s strong embrace,</p>

<p>And made her joy a bridge twixt earth and heaven, <br />
  An abyss yawned suddenly beneath her heart. <br />
  A vast and nameless fear dragged at her nerves <br />
  As drags a wild beast its half-slaughtered prey; <br />
  It seemed to have no den from which it sprang: <br />
  It was not hers, but hid its unseen cause. <br />
  Then rushing came its vast and fearful Fount. <br />
  A formless Dread with shapeless endless wings <br />
  Filling the universe with its dangerous breath, <br />
  A denser darkness than the Night could bear, <br />
  Enveloped the heavens and possessed the earth. <br />
  A rolling surge of silent death, it came <br />
  Curving round the far edge of the quaking globe; <br />
  Effacing heaven with its enormous stride <br />
  It willed to expunge the choked and anguished air <br />
  And end the fable of the joy of life. <br />
  It seemed her very being to forbid, <br />
  Abolishing all by which her nature lived, <br />
  And laboured to blot out her body and soul, <br />
  A clutch of some half-seen Invisible, <br />
  An ocean of terror and of sovereign might, <br />
  A person and a black infinity. <br />
  It seemed to cry to her without thought or word <br />
  The message of its dark eternity <br />
  And the awful meaning of its silences: <br />
  Out of some sullen monstrous vast arisen, <br />
  Out of an abysmal deep of grief and fear <br />
  Imagined by some blind regardless self, <br />
  A consciousness of being without its joy, <br />
  Empty of thought, incapable of bliss, <br />
  That felt life blank and nowhere found a soul, <br />
  A voice to the dumb anguish of the heart <br />
  Conveyed a stark sense of unspoken words; <br />
  In her own depths she heard the unuttered thought <br />
  That made unreal the world and all life meant. <br />
  &#8220;Who art thou who claimst thy crown of separate birth,</p>

  And sit with God tasting a human joy. <br />
  I have created all, all I devour; <br />
  I am Death and the dark terrible Mother of life, <br />
  I am Kali black and naked in the world, <br />
  I am Maya and the universe is my cheat. <br />
  I lay waste human happiness with my breath <br />
  And slay the will to live, the joy to be <br />
  That all may pass back into nothingness <br />
  And only abide the eternal and absolute. <br />
  For only the blank Eternal can be true. <br />
  All else is shadow and flash in Mind&#8217;s bright glass, <br />
  Mind, hollow mirror in which Ignorance sees <br />
  A splendid figure of its own false self <br />
  And dreams it sees a glorious solid world. <br />
  O soul, inventor of man&#8217;s thoughts and hopes, <br />
  Thyself the invention of the moments&#8217; stream, <br />
  Illusion&#8217;s centre or subtle apex point, <br />
  At last know thyself, from vain existence cease.&#8221; <br />
  A shadow of the negating Absolute, <br />
  The intolerant Darkness travelled surging past <br />
  And ebbed in her the formidable Voice. <br />
  It left behind her inner world laid waste: <br />
  A barren silence weighed upon her heart, <br />
  Her kingdom of delight was there no more;</p>

<p>Only her soul remained, its emptied stage, <br />
  Awaiting the unknown eternal Will. <br />
  Then from the heights a greater Voice came down, <br />
  The Word that touches the heart and finds the soul, <br />
  The voice of Light after the voice of Night: <br />
  The cry of the Abyss drew Heaven&#8217;s reply, <br />
  A might of storm chased by the might of the Sun. <br />
  &#8220;O soul, bare not thy kingdom to the foe; <br />
  Consent to hide thy royalty of bliss <br />
  Lest Time and Fate find out its avenues <br />
  And beat with thunderous knock upon thy gates. <br />
  Hide whilst thou canst thy treasure of separate self <br />
  Behind the luminous rampart of thy depths <br />
  Till of a vaster empire it grows part. <br />
  But not for self alone the Self is won: <br />
  Content abide not with one conquered realm; <br />
  Adventure all to make the whole world thine, <br />
  To break into greater kingdoms turn thy force. <br />
  Fear not to be nothing that thou mayst be all; <br />
  Assent to the emptiness of the Supreme <br />
  That all in thee may reach its absolute. <br />
  Accept to be small and human on the earth, <br />
  Interrupting thy new-born divinity, <br />
  That man may find his utter self in God. <br />
  If for thy own sake only thou hast come, <br />
  An immortal spirit into the mortal&#8217;s world, <br />
  To found thy luminous kingdom in God&#8217;s dark, <br />
  In the Inconscient&#8217;s realm one shining star, <br />
  One door in the Ignorance opened upon light, <br />
  Why hadst thou any need to come at all? <br />
  Thou hast come down into a struggling world <br />
  To aid a blind and suffering mortal race, <br />
  To open to Light the eyes that could not see, <br />
  To bring down bliss into the heart of grief, <br />
  To make thy life a bridge twixt earth and heaven; <br />
  If thou wouldst save the toiling universe,</p>

  Then shalt thou uncover the Unknowable <br />

  And the diviner miracle still to be <br />
  When Nature who is now unconscious God <br />
  Translucent grows to the Eternal&#8217;s light, <br />
  Her seeing his sight, her walk his steps of power <br />
  And life is filled with a spiritual joy <br />

  Plunging her deep regard into herself <br />
  In her soul&#8217;s privacy in the silent Night. <br />
  Aloof and standing back detached and calm, <br />
  A witness of the drama of herself, <br />
  A student of her own interior scene, <br />
  She watched the passion and the toil of life <br />
  And heard in the crowded thoroughfares of mind <br />
  The unceasing tread and passage of her thoughts. <br />
  All she allowed to rise that chose to stir; <br />
  Calling, compelling nought, forbidding nought, <br />
  She left all to the process formed in Time <br />
  And the free initiative of Nature&#8217;s will. <br />
  Thus following the complex human play <br />
  She heard the prompter&#8217;s voice behind the scenes, <br />
  Perceived the original libretto&#8217;s set <br />
  And the organ theme of the composer Force. <br />
  All she beheld that surges from man&#8217;s depths, <br />
  The animal instincts prowling mid life&#8217;s trees, <br />
  The impulses that whisper to the heart <br />
  And passion&#8217;s thunder-chase sweeping the nerves; <br />
  She saw the Powers that stare from the Abyss <br />
  And the wordless Light that liberates the soul. <br />
  But most her gaze pursued the birth of thought.</p>

<p>Affranchised from the look of surface mind <br />
  She paused not to survey the official case, <br />
  The issue of forms from the office of the brain, <br />
  Its factory of thought-sounds and soundless words <br />
  And voices stored within unheard by men, <br />
  Its mint and treasury of shining coin. <br />
  These were but counters in mind&#8217;s symbol game, <br />
  A gramophone&#8217;s discs, a reproduction&#8217;s film, <br />
  A list of signs, a cipher and a code. <br />
  In our unseen subtle body thought is born <br />
  Or there it enters from the cosmic field. <br />
  Oft from her soul stepped out a naked thought <br />
  Luminous with mysteried lips and wonderful eyes; <br />
  Or from her heart emerged some burning face <br />
  And looked for life and love and passionate truth, <br />
  Aspired to heaven or embraced the world <br />
  Or led the fancy like a fleeting moon <br />
  Across the dull sky of man&#8217;s common days, <br />
  Amidst the doubtful certitudes of earth&#8217;s lore, <br />
  To the celestial beauty of faith gave form, <br />
  As if at flower-prints in a dingy room <br />
  Laughed in a golden vase one living rose. <br />
  A thaumaturgist sat in her heart&#8217;s deep, <br />
  Compelled the forward stride, the upward look, <br />
  Till wonder leaped into the illumined breast <br />
  And life grew marvellous with transfiguring hope. <br />
  A seeing will pondered between the brows; <br />
  Thoughts, glistening Angels, stood behind the brain <br />
  In flashing armour, folding hands of prayer, <br />
  And poured heaven&#8217;s rays into the earthly form. <br />
  Imaginations flamed up from her breast, <br />
  Unearthly beauty, touches of surpassing joy <br />
  And plans of miracle, dreams of delight: <br />
  Around her navel lotus clustering close <br />
  Her large sensations of the teeming worlds <br />
  Streamed their dumb movements of the unformed Idea;</p>

<p>Invading the small sensitive flower of the throat <br />
  They brought their mute unuttered resonances <br />
  To kindle the figures of a heavenly speech. <br />
  Below, desires formed their wordless wish, <br />
  And longings of physical sweetness and ecstasy <br />
  Translated into the accents of a cry <br />
  Their grasp on objects and their clasp on souls. <br />
  Her body&#8217;s thoughts climbed from her conscious limbs <br />

  Only to the inner mind they speak direct, <br />

  Eyes looked through crevices in the invisible wall <br />

  Thoughts that enlarged our limited human range, <br />
  Lifted the ideal&#8217;s half-quenched or sinking torch <br />
  Or peered through the finite at the infinite. <br />
  A sight opened upon the invisible <br />
  And sensed the shapes that mortal eyes see not, <br />
  The sounds that mortal listening cannot hear, <br />
  The blissful sweetness of the intangible&#8217;s touch; <br />
  The objects that to us are empty air, <br />
  Are there the stuff of daily experience</p>

<p>And the common pabulum of sense and thought. <br />
  The beings of the subtle realms appeared <br />
  And scenes concealed behind our earthly scene; <br />
  She saw the life of remote continents <br />
  And distance deafened not to voices far; <br />
  She felt the movements crossing unknown minds; <br />
  The past&#8217;s events occurred before her eyes. <br />
  The great world&#8217;s thoughts were part of her own thought, <br />
  The feelings dumb for ever and unshared, <br />
  The ideas that never found an utterance. <br />
  The dim subconscient&#8217;s incoherent hints <br />
  Laid bare a meaning twisted, deep and strange, <br />
  The bizarre secret of their fumbling speech, <br />
  Their links with underlying reality. <br />
  The unseen grew visible and audible: <br />
  Thoughts leaped down from a superconscient field <br />
  Like eagles swooping from a viewless peak, <br />
  Thoughts gleamed up from the screened subliminal depths <br />
  Like golden fishes from a hidden sea. <br />
  This world is a vast unbroken totality, <br />
  A deep solidarity joins its contrary powers; <br />
  God&#8217;s summits look back on the mute Abyss. <br />
  So man evolving to divinest heights <br />
  Colloques still with the animal and the Djinn; <br />
  The human godhead with star-gazer eyes <br />
  Lives still in one house with the primal beast. <br />
  The high meets the low, all is a single plan. <br />
  So she beheld the many births of thought, <br />
  If births can be of what eternal is; <br />
  For the Eternal&#8217;s powers are like himself, <br />
  Timeless in the Timeless, in Time ever born. <br />
  This too she saw that all in outer mind <br />
  Is made, not born, a product perishable, <br />
  Forged in the body&#8217;s factory by earth-force. <br />
  This mind is a dynamic small machine <br />
  Producing ceaselessly, till it wears out,</p>

<p>With raw material drawn from the outside world, <br />
  The patterns sketched out by an artist God. <br />
  Often our thoughts are finished cosmic wares <br />
  Admitted by a silent office gate <br />
  And passed through the subconscient&#8217;s galleries, <br />
  Then issued in Time&#8217;s mart as private make. <br />
  For now they bear the living person&#8217;s stamp; <br />
  A trick, a special hue claims them his own. <br />
  All else is Nature&#8217;s craft and this too hers. <br />
  Our tasks are given, we are but instruments; <br />
  Nothing is all our own that we create: <br />
  The Power that acts in us is not our force. <br />
  The genius too receives from some high fount <br />
  Concealed in a supernal secrecy <br />
  The work that gives him an immortal name. <br />
  The word, the form, the charm, the glory and grace <br />
  Are missioned sparks from a stupendous Fire; <br />
  A sample from the laboratory of God <br />
  Of which he holds the patent upon earth, <br />
  Comes to him wrapped in golden coverings; <br />
  He listens for Inspiration&#8217;s postman knock <br />
  And takes delivery of the priceless gift <br />
  A little spoilt by the receiver mind <br />
  Or mixed with the manufacture of his brain; <br />
  When least defaced, then is it most divine. <br />
  Although his ego claims the world for its use, <br />
  Man is a dynamo for the cosmic work; <br />
  Nature does most in him, God the high rest: <br />
  Only his soul&#8217;s acceptance is his own. <br />
  This independent, once a power supreme, <br />
  Self-born before the universe was made, <br />
  Accepting cosmos, binds himself Nature&#8217;s serf <br />
  Till he becomes her freedman&#8211;or God&#8217;s slave. <br />
  This is the appearance in our mortal front; <br />
  Our greater truth of being lies behind: <br />
  Our consciousness is cosmic and immense,</p>

<p>But only when we break through Matter&#8217;s wall <br />
  In that spiritual vastness can we stand <br />
  Where we can live the masters of our world <br />
  And mind is only a means and body a tool. <br />
  For above the birth of body and of thought <br />
  Our spirit&#8217;s truth lives in the naked self <br />
  And from that height, unbound, surveys the world. <br />
  Out of the mind she rose to escape its law <br />
  That it might sleep in some deep shadow of self <br />
  Or fall silent in the silence of the Unseen. <br />
  High she attained and stood from Nature free <br />
  And saw creation&#8217;s life from far above, <br />
  Thence upon all she laid her sovereign will <br />
  To dedicate it to God&#8217;s timeless calm: <br />
  Then all grew tranquil in her being&#8217;s space, <br />
  Only sometimes small thoughts arose and fell <br />
  Like quiet waves upon a silent sea <br />

  Yet the mind&#8217;s factory had ceased to work, <br />
  There was no sound of the dynamo&#8217;s throb, <br />
  There came no call from the still fields of life. <br />

  Her mind now seemed like a vast empty room <br />
  Or like a peaceful landscape without sound. <br />
  This men call quietude and prize as peace. <br />
  But to her deeper sight all yet was there, <br />
  Effervescing like a chaos under a lid; <br />
  Feelings and thoughts cried out for word and act <br />
  But found no response in the silenced brain: <br />
  All was suppressed but nothing yet expunged; <br />
  At every moment might explosion come. <br />
  Then this too paused; the body seemed a stone. <br />
  All now was a wide mighty vacancy, <br />
  But still excluded from eternity&#8217;s hush; <br />
  For still was far the repose of the Absolute</p>

<p>And the ocean silence of Infinity. <br />
  Even now some thoughts could cross her solitude; <br />
  These surged not from the depths or from within <br />
  Cast up from formlessness to seek a form, <br />
  Spoke not the body&#8217;s need nor voiced life&#8217;s call. <br />
  These seemed not born nor made in human Time: <br />
  Children of cosmic Nature from a far world, <br />
  Idea&#8217;s shapes in complete armour of words <br />
  Posted like travellers in an alien space. <br />
  Out of some far expanse they seemed to come <br />
  As if carried on vast wings like large white sails, <br />
  And with easy access reached the inner ear <br />
  As though they used a natural privileged right <br />
  To the high royal entries of the soul. <br />
  As yet their path lay deep-concealed in light. <br />
  Then looking to know whence the intruders came <br />
  She saw a spiritual immensity <br />
  Pervading and encompassing the world-space <br />
  As ether our transparent tangible air, <br />
  And through it sailing tranquilly a thought. <br />
  As smoothly glides a ship nearing its port, <br />
  Ignorant of embargo and blockade, <br />
  Confident of entrance and the visa&#8217;s seal, <br />
  It came to the silent city of the brain <br />
  Towards its accustomed and expectant quay, <br />
  But met a barring will, a blow of Force <br />
  And sank vanishing in the immensity. <br />
  After a long vacant pause another appeared <br />
  And others one by one suddenly emerged, <br />
  Mind&#8217;s unexpected visitors from the Unseen <br />
  Like far-off sails upon a lonely sea. <br />
  But soon that commerce failed, none reached mind&#8217;s coast. <br />
  Then all grew still, nothing moved any more: <br />
  Immobile, self-rapt, timeless, solitary <br />
  A silent spirit pervaded silent Space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In that absolute stillness bare and formidable <br />
  There was glimpsed an all-negating Void Supreme <br />
  That claimed its mystic Nihil&#8217;s sovereign right <br />
  To cancel Nature and deny the soul. <br />
  Even the nude sense of self grew pale and thin: <br />
  Impersonal, signless, featureless, void of forms <br />
  A blank pure consciousness had replaced the mind. <br />
  Her spirit seemed the substance of a name, <br />
  The world a pictured symbol drawn on self, <br />
  A dream of images, a dream of sounds <br />
  Built up the semblance of a universe <br />
  Or lent to spirit the appearance of a world. <br />
  This was self-seeing; in that intolerant hush <br />
  No notion and no concept could take shape, <br />
  There was no sense to frame the figure of things, <br />
  A sheer self-sight was there, no thought arose. <br />
  Emotion slept deep down in the still heart <br />
  Or lay buried in a cemetery of peace: <br />
  All feelings seemed quiescent, calm or dead, <br />
  As if the heart-strings rent could work no more <br />
  And joy and grief could never rise again. <br />
  The heart beat on with an unconscious rhythm <br />
  But no response came from it and no cry. <br />
  Vain was the provocation of events; <br />
  Nothing within answered an outside touch, <br />
  No nerve was stirred and no reaction rose. <br />
  Yet still her body saw and moved and spoke; <br />
  It understood without the aid of thought, <br />
  It said whatever needed to be said, <br />
  It did whatever needed to be done. <br />
  There was no person there behind the act, <br />
  No mind that chose or passed the fitting word: <br />
  All wrought like an unerring apt machine. <br />
  As if continuing old habitual turns, <br />
  And pushed by an old unexhausted force <br />
  The engine did the work for which it was made:</p>

<p>Her consciousness looked on and took no part; <br />
  All it upheld, in nothing had a share. <br />
  There was no strong initiator will; <br />
  An incoherence crossing a firm void <br />
  Slipped into an order of related chance. <br />
  A pure perception was the only power <br />
  That stood behind her action and her sight. <br />
  If that retired, all objects would be extinct, <br />
  Her private universe would cease to be, <br />
  The house she had built with bricks of thought and sense <br />
  In the beginning after the birth of Space. <br />
  This seeing was identical with the seen; <br />
  It knew without knowledge all that could be known, <br />
  It saw impartially the world go by, <br />
  But in the same supine unmoving glance <br />
  Saw too its abysmal unreality. <br />
  It watched the figure of the cosmic game, <br />
  But the thought and inner life in forms seemed dead, <br />
  Abolished by her own collapse of thought: <br />
  A hollow physical shell persisted still. <br />
  All seemed a brilliant shadow of itself, <br />
  A cosmic film of scenes and images: <br />
  The enduring mass and outline of the hills <br />
  Was a design sketched on a silent mind <br />
  And held to a tremulous false solidity <br />
  By constant beats of visionary sight. <br />
  The forest with its emerald multitudes <br />
  Clothed with its show of hues vague empty Space, <br />
  A painting&#8217;s colours hiding a surface void <br />
  That flickered upon dissolution&#8217;s edge; <br />
  The blue heavens, an illusion of the eyes, <br />
  Roofed in the mind&#8217;s illusion of a world. <br />
  The men who walked beneath an unreal sky <br />
  Seemed mobile puppets out of cardboard cut <br />
  And pushed by unseen hands across the soil <br />
  Or moving pictures upon Fancy&#8217;s film:</p>

<p>There was no soul within, no power of life. <br />
  The brain&#8217;s vibrations that appear like thought, <br />
  The nerve&#8217;s brief answer to each contact&#8217;s knock, <br />
  The heart&#8217;s quiverings felt as joy and grief and love <br />
  Were twitchings of the body, their seeming self, <br />
  That body forged from atoms and from gas <br />
  A manufactured lie of Maya&#8217;s make, <br />
  Its life a dream seen by the sleeping Void. <br />
  The animals lone or trooping through the glades <br />
  Fled like a passing vision of beauty and grace <br />
  Imagined by some all-creating Eye. <br />
  Yet something was there behind the fading scene; <br />
  Wherever she turned, at whatsoever she looked, <br />
  It was perceived, yet hid from mind and sight. <br />
  The One only real shut itself from Space <br />
  And stood aloof from the idea of Time. <br />
  Its truth escaped from shape and line and hue. <br />
  All else grew unsubstantial, self-annulled, <br />
  This only everlasting seemed and true, <br />
  Yet nowhere dwelt, it was outside the hours. <br />
  This only could justify the labour of sight, <br />
  But sight could not define for it a form; <br />
  This only could appease the unsatisfied ear <br />
  But hearing listened in vain for a missing sound; <br />
  This answered not the sense, called not to Mind. <br />
  It met her as the uncaught inaudible Voice <br />
  That speaks for ever from the Unknowable. <br />
  It met her like an omnipresent point <br />
  Pure of dimensions, unfixed, invisible, <br />
  The single oneness of its multiplied beat <br />
  Accentuating its sole eternity. <br />
  It faced her as some vast Nought&#8217;s immensity, <br />
  An endless No to all that seems to be, <br />
  An endless Yes to things ever unconceived <br />
  And all that is unimagined and unthought, <br />
  An eternal zero or untotalled Aught,</p>

<p>A spaceless and a placeless Infinite. <br />
  Yet eternity and infinity seemed but words <br />
  Vainly affixed by mind&#8217;s incompetence <br />
  To its stupendous lone reality. <br />
  The world is but a spark-burst from its light, <br />
  All moments flashes from its Timelessness, <br />
  All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless <br />
  That disappear from Mind when That is seen. <br />
  It held, as if a shield before its face, <br />
  A consciousness that saw without a seer, <br />
  The Truth where knowledge is not nor knower nor known, <br />
  The Love enamoured of its own delight <br />
  In which the Lover is not nor the Beloved <br />
  Bringing their personal passion into the Vast, <br />
  The Force omnipotent in quietude, <br />
  The Bliss that none can ever hope to taste. <br />
  It cancelled the convincing cheat of self; <br />
  A truth in nothingness was its mighty clue. <br />
  If all existence could renounce to be <br />
  And Being take refuge in Non-being&#8217;s arms <br />
  And Non-being could strike out its ciphered round, <br />
  Some lustre of that Reality might appear. <br />
  A formless liberation came on her. <br />
  Once sepulchred alive in brain and flesh <br />
  She had risen up from body, mind and life; <br />
  She was no more a Person in a world, <br />
  She had escaped into infinity. <br />
  What once had been herself had disappeared; <br />
  There was no frame of things, no figure of soul. <br />
  A refugee from the domain of sense, <br />
  Evading the necessity of thought, <br />
  Delivered from Knowledge and from Ignorance <br />
  And rescued from the true and the untrue, <br />
  She shared the Superconscient&#8217;s high retreat <br />
  Beyond the self-born Word, the nude Idea, <br />
  The first bare solid ground of consciousness;</p>

<p>Beings were not there, existence had no place, <br />
  There was no temptation of the joy to be. <br />
  Unutterably effaced, no one and null, <br />
  A vanishing vestige like a violet trace, <br />
  A faint record merely of a self now past, <br />
  She was a point in the unknowable. <br />
  Only some last annulment now remained, <br />
  Annihilation&#8217;s vague indefinable step: <br />
  A memory of being still was there <br />
  And kept her separate from nothingness: <br />
  She was in That but still became not That. <br />
  This shadow of herself so close to nought <br />
  Could be again self&#8217;s point d&#8217;appui to live, <br />
  Return out of the Inconceivable <br />
  And be what some mysterious vast might choose. <br />
  Even as the Unknowable decreed, <br />
  She might be nought or new-become the All, <br />
  Or if the omnipotent Nihil took a shape <br />
  Emerge as someone and redeem the world. <br />
  Even, she might learn what the mystic cipher held, <br />
  This seeming exit or closed end of all <br />
  Could be a blind tenebrous passage screened from sight, <br />
  Her state the eclipsing shell of a darkened sun <br />
  On its secret way to the Ineffable. <br />
  Even now her splendid being might flame back <br />
  Out of the silence and the nullity, <br />
  A gleaming portion of the All-Wonderful, <br />
  A power of some all-affirming Absolute, <br />
  A shining mirror of the eternal Truth <br />
  To show to the One-in-all its manifest face, <br />
  To the souls of men their deep identity. <br />
  Or she might wake into God&#8217;s quietude <br />
  Beyond the cosmic day and cosmic night <br />
  And rest appeased in his white eternity. <br />
  But this was now unreal or remote <br />
  Or covered in the mystic fathomless blank.</p>
