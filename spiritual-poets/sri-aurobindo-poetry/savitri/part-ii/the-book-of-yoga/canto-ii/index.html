  </td>
<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">As in the vigilance of the sleepless night <br />
  Through the slow heavy-footed silent hours, <br />
  Repressing in her bosom its load of grief, <br />
  She sat staring at the dumb tread of Time <br />
  And the approach of ever-nearing Fate, <br />
  A summons from her being&#8217;s summit came, <br />
  A sound, a call that broke the seals of Night. <br />
  Above her brows where will and knowledge meet <br />
  A mighty Voice invaded mortal space. <br />
  It seemed to come from inaccessible heights <br />
  And yet was intimate with all the world <br />
  And knew the meaning of the steps of Time <br />
  And saw eternal destiny&#8217;s changeless scene <br />
  Filling the far prospect of the cosmic gaze. <br />
  As the Voice touched, her body became a stark <br />
  And rigid golden statue of motionless trance, <br />
  A stone of God lit by an amethyst soul. <br />
  Around her body&#8217;s stillness all grew still: <br />
  Her heart listened to its slow measured beats, <br />
  Her mind renouncing thought heard and was mute: <br />
  &#8220;Why camest thou to this dumb deathbound earth, <br />
  This ignorant life beneath indifferent skies <br />
  Tied like a sacrifice on the altar of Time, <br />
  O spirit, O immortal energy, <br />
  If &#8217;twas to nurse grief in a helpless heart <br />
  Or with hard tearless eyes await thy doom? <br />
  Arise, O soul, and vanquish Time and Death.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri&#8217;s heart replied in the dim night: <br />
  &#8220;My strength is taken from me and given to Death. <br />
  Why should I lift my hands to the shut heavens <br />
  Or struggle with mute inevitable Fate</td>

<p>Or hope in vain to uplift an ignorant race <br />
  Who hug their lot and mock the saviour Light <br />
  And see in Mind wisdom&#8217;s sole tabernacle, <br />
  In its harsh peak and its inconscient base <br />
  A rock of safety and an anchor of sleep? <br />
  Is there a God whom any cry can move? <br />
  He sits in peace and leaves the mortal&#8217;s strength <br />
  Impotent against his calm omnipotent Law <br />
  And Inconscience and the almighty hands of Death. <br />
  What need have I, what need has Satyavan <br />
  To avoid the black-meshed net, the dismal door, <br />
  Or call a mightier Light into life&#8217;s closed room, <br />
  A greater Law into man&#8217;s little world? <br />
  Why should I strive with earth&#8217;s unyielding laws <br />
  Or stave off death&#8217;s inevitable hour? <br />
  This surely is best to pactise with my fate <br />
  And follow close behind my lover&#8217;s steps <br />
  And pass through night from twilight to the sun <br />
  Across the tenebrous river that divides <br />
  The adjoining parishes of earth and heaven. <br />
  Then could we lie inarmed breast upon breast, <br />
  Untroubled by thought, untroubled by our hearts, <br />
  Forgetting man and life and time and its hours, <br />
  Forgetting eternity&#8217;s call, forgetting God.&#8221; <br />
  The Voice replied: &#8220;Is this enough, O spirit? <br />
  And what shall thy soul say when it wakes and knows <br />
  The work was left undone for which it came? <br />
  Or is this all for thy being born on earth <br />
  Charged with a mandate from eternity, <br />
  A listener to the voices of the years, <br />
  A follower of the footprints of the gods, <br />
  To pass and leave unchanged the old dusty laws? <br />
  Shall there be no new tables, no new Word, <br />
  No greater light come down upon the earth <br />
  Delivering her from her unconsciousness, <br />
  Man&#8217;s spirit from unalterable Fate?</p>

<p>Cam&#8217;st thou not down to open the doors of Fate, <br />
  The iron doors that seemed for ever closed, <br />
  And lead man to Truth&#8217;s wide and golden road <br />
  That runs through finite things to eternity? <br />
  Is this then the report that I must make, <br />
  My head bowed with shame before the Eternal&#8217;s seat,&#8211; <br />
  His power he kindled in thy body has failed, <br />
  His labourer returns, her task undone?&#8221; <br />
  Then Savitri&#8217;s heart fell mute, it spoke no word. <br />
  But holding back her troubled rebel heart, <br />
  Abrupt, erect and strong, calm like a hill, <br />
  Surmounting the seas of mortal ignorance, <br />
  Its peak immutable above mind&#8217;s air, <br />
  A Power within her answered the still Voice: <br />
  &#8220;I am thy portion here charged with thy work, <br />
  As thou myself seated for ever above, <br />
  Speak to my depths, O great and deathless Voice, <br />
  Command, for I am here to do thy will.&#8221; <br />
  The Voice replied: &#8220;Remember why thou cam&#8217;st: <br />
  Find out thy soul, recover thy hid self, <br />
  In silence seek God&#8217;s meaning in thy depths, <br />
  Then mortal nature change to the divine. <br />
  Open God&#8217;s door, enter into his trance. <br />
  Cast Thought from thee, that nimble ape of Light: <br />
  In his tremendous hush stilling thy brain <br />
  His vast Truth wake within and know and see. <br />
  Cast from thee sense that veils thy spirit&#8217;s sight: <br />
  In the enormous emptiness of thy mind <br />
  Thou shalt see the Eternal&#8217;s body in the world, <br />
  Know him in every voice heard by thy soul, <br />
  In the world&#8217;s contacts meet his single touch; <br />
  All things shall fold thee into his embrace. <br />
  Conquer thy heart&#8217;s throbs, let thy heart beat in God: <br />
  Thy nature shall be the engine of his works, <br />
  Thy voice shall house the mightiness of his Word: <br />
  Then shalt thou harbour my force and conquer Death.&#8221;</p>

  The thunder crashed above her, the rain hissed, <br />
  Its million footsteps pattered on the roof. <br />
  Impassive mid the movement and the cry, <br />
  Witness of the thoughts of mind, the moods of life, <br />
  She looked into herself and sought for her soul. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A dream disclosed to her the cosmic past, <br />
  The crypt-seed and the mystic origins, <br />
  The shadowy beginnings of world-fate: <br />
  A lamp of symbol lighting hidden truth <br />
  Imaged to her the world&#8217;s significance. <br />
  In the indeterminate formlessness of Self <br />
  Creation took its first mysterious steps, <br />
  It made the body&#8217;s shape a house of soul <br />
  And Matter learned to think and person grew; <br />
  She saw Space peopled with the seeds of life <br />
  And saw the human creature born in Time. <br />
  At first appeared a dim half-neutral tide <br />
  Of being emerging out of infinite Nought: <br />
  A consciousness looked at the inconscient Vast <br />
  And pleasure and pain stirred in the insensible Void. <br />
  All was the deed of a blind World-Energy: <br />
  Unconscious of her own exploits she worked, <br />
  Shaping a universe out of the Inane. <br />
  In fragmentary beings she grew aware: <br />
  A chaos of little sensibilities <br />
  Gathered round a small ego&#8217;s pin-point head; <br />
  In it a sentient creature found its poise, <br />
  It moved and lived a breathing, thinking whole. <br />
  On a dim ocean of subconscient life <br />
  A formless surface consciousness awoke: <br />
  A stream of thoughts and feelings came and went,</p>

<p>A foam of memories hardened and became <br />
  A bright crust of habitual sense and thought, <br />
  A seat of living personality <br />
  And recurrent habits mimicked permanence. <br />
  Mind nascent laboured out a mutable form, <br />
  It built a mobile house on shifting sands, <br />
  A floating isle upon a bottomless sea. <br />
  A conscious being was by this labour made; <br />
  It looked around it on its difficult field <br />
  In the green wonderful and perilous earth; <br />
  It hoped in a brief body to survive, <br />
  Relying on Matter&#8217;s false eternity. <br />
  It felt a godhead in its fragile house; <br />
  It saw blue heavens, dreamed immortality. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A conscious soul in the Inconscient&#8217;s world, <br />
  Hidden behind our thoughts and hopes and dreams, <br />
  An indifferent Master signing Nature&#8217;s acts <br />
  Leaves the vicegerent mind a seeming king. <br />
  In his floating house upon the sea of Time <br />
  The regent sits at work and never rests: <br />
  He is a puppet of the dance of Time; <br />
  He is driven by the hours, the moment&#8217;s call <br />
  Compels him with the thronging of life&#8217;s need <br />
  And the babel of the voices of the world. <br />
  This mind no silence knows nor dreamless sleep, <br />
  In the incessant circling of its steps <br />
  Thoughts tread for ever through the listening brain; <br />
  It toils like a machine and cannot stop. <br />
  Into the body&#8217;s many-storeyed rooms <br />
  Endless crowd down the dream-god&#8217;s messages. <br />
  All is a hundred-toned murmur and babble and stir, <br />
  There is a tireless running to and fro, <br />
  A haste of movement and a ceaseless cry. <br />
  The hurried servant senses answer apace <br />
  To every knock upon the outer doors, <br />
  Bring in time&#8217;s visitors, report each call,</p>

  And the heavy business of unnumbered lives <br />
  And all the thousandfold commerce of the world. <br />
  Even in the tracts of sleep is scant repose; <br />
  He mocks life&#8217;s steps in strange subconscient dreams, <br />
  He strays in a subtle realm of symbol scenes, <br />
  His night with thin-air visions and dim forms <br />
  He packs or peoples with slight drifting shapes <br />

  He scales the Unseen, his depths dare the Abyss; <br />

  He guards the being&#8217;s covered mysteries <br />
  Beneath the threshold, behind shadowy gates <br />
  Or shut in vast cellars of inconscient sleep. <br />
  The immaculate Divine All-Wonderful <br />
  Casts into the argent purity of his soul <br />
  His splendour and his greatness and the light <br />
  Of self-creation in Time&#8217;s infinity <br />
  As into a sublimely mirroring glass. <br />
  Man in the world&#8217;s life works out the dreams of God.</p>

  Her glories walk in him and her darknesses. <br />
  Man&#8217;s house of life holds not the gods alone: <br />

  Inferno surges into the human air <br />
  And touches all with a perverting breath. <br />
  Grey forces like a thin miasma creep, <br />
  Stealing through chinks in his closed mansion&#8217;s doors, <br />
  Discolouring the walls of upper mind <br />
  In which he lives his fair and specious life, <br />
  And leave behind a stench of sin and death: <br />
  Not only rise in him perverse drifts of thought <br />
  And formidable formless influences, <br />
  But there come presences and awful shapes: <br />
  Tremendous forms and faces mount dim steps <br />
  And stare at times into his living-rooms, <br />
  Or called up for a moment&#8217;s passionate work</p>

<p>Finds out its settled poise and fated hour. <br />
  Our surface watched in vain by reason&#8217;s gaze, <br />
  Invaded by the impromptus of the unseen, <br />
  Helpless records the accidents of Time, <br />
  The involuntary turns and leaps of life. <br />
  Only a little of us foresees its steps, <br />
  Only a little has will and purposed pace. <br />
  A vast subliminal is man&#8217;s measureless part. <br />
  The dim subconscient is his cavern base. <br />
  Abolished vainly in the walks of Time <br />
  Our past lives still in our unconscious selves <br />
  And by the weight of its hidden influences <br />
  Is shaped our future&#8217;s self-discovery. <br />
  Thus all is an inevitable chain <br />
  And yet a series seems of accidents. <br />
  The unremembering hours repeat the old acts, <br />
  Our dead past round our future&#8217;s ankles clings <br />
  And drags back the new nature&#8217;s glorious stride, <br />
  Or from its buried corpse old ghosts arise, <br />
  Old thoughts, old longings, dead passions live again, <br />
  Recur in sleep or move the waking man <br />
  To words that force the barrier of the lips, <br />
  To deeds that suddenly start and o&#8217;erleap <br />
  His head of reason and his guardian will. <br />
  An old self lurks in the new self we are; <br />
  Hardly we escape from what we once had been: <br />
  In the dim gleam of habit&#8217;s passages, <br />
  In the subconscient&#8217;s darkling corridors <br />
  All things are carried by the porter nerves <br />
  And nothing checked by subterranean mind, <br />
  Unstudied by the guardians of the doors <br />
  And passed by a blind instinctive memory, <br />
  The old gang dismissed, old cancelled passports serve. <br />
  Nothing is wholly dead that once had lived; <br />
  In dim tunnels of the world&#8217;s being and in ours <br />
  The old rejected nature still survives;</p>

  For here are not our large diviner heights; <br />
  Our summits in the superconscient&#8217;s blaze <br />
  Are glorious with the very face of God: <br />
  There is our aspect of eternity, <br />
  There is the figure of the god we are, <br />
  His young unaging look on deathless things, <br />
  His joy in our escape from death and Time, <br />
  His immortality and light and bliss.</p>

  Slowly emerging from the heart&#8217;s chapel of light <br />

  He gazed into the future and the unseen; <br />
  He used the powers earth-instruments cannot use, <br />
  A pastime made of the impossible; <br />

  He scattered formulas of omnipotence. <br />
  Thus man in his little house made of earth&#8217;s dust <br />
