<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Fate followed her foreseen immutable road. <br />
  Man&#8217;s hopes and longings build the journeying wheels <br />
  That bear the body of his destiny <br />
  And lead his blind will towards an unknown goal. <br />
  His fate within him shapes his acts and rules; <br />
  Its face and form already are born in him, <br />
  Its parentage is in his secret soul: <br />
  Here Matter seems to mould the body&#8217;s life <br />
  And the soul follows where its nature drives. <br />
  Nature and Fate compel his free-will&#8217;s choice. <br />
  But greater spirits this balance can reverse <br />
  And make the soul the artist of its fate. <br />
  This is the mystic truth our ignorance hides: <br />
  Doom is a passage for our inborn force, <br />
  Our ordeal is the hidden spirit&#8217;s choice, <br />
  Ananke is our being&#8217;s own decree. <br />
  All was fulfilled the heart of Savitri <br />
  Flower-sweet and adamant, passionate and calm, <br />
  Had chosen and on her strength&#8217;s unbending road <br />
  Forced to its issue the long cosmic curve. <br />
  Once more she sat behind loud hastening hooves; <br />
  A speed of armoured squadrons and a voice <br />
  Far-heard of chariots bore her from her home. <br />
  A couchant earth wakened in its dumb muse <br />
  Looked up at her from a vast indolence: <br />
  Hills wallowing in a bright haze, large lands <br />
  That lolled at ease beneath the summer heavens, <br />
  Region on region spacious in the sun, <br />
  Cities like chrysolites in the wide blaze <br />
  And yellow rivers pacing lion-maned</td>

<p>Led to the Shalwa marches&#8217; emerald line, <br />
  A happy front to iron vastnesses <br />
  And austere peaks and titan solitudes. <br />
  Once more was near the fair and fated place, <br />
  The borders gleaming with the groves&#8217; delight <br />
  Where first she met the face of Satyavan <br />
  And he saw like one waking into a dream <br />
  Some timeless beauty and reality, <br />
  The moon-gold sweetness of heaven&#8217;s earth-born child. <br />
  The past receded and the future neared: <br />
  Far now behind lay Madra&#8217;s spacious halls, <br />
  The white carved pillars, the cool dim alcoves, <br />
  The tinged mosaic of the crystal floors, <br />
  The towered pavilions, the wind-rippled pools <br />
  And gardens humming with the murmur of bees, <br />
  Forgotten soon or a pale memory <br />
  The fountain&#8217;s plash in the white stone-bound pool, <br />
  The thoughtful noontide&#8217;s brooding solemn trance, <br />
  The colonnade&#8217;s dream grey in the quiet eve, <br />
  The slow moonrise gliding in front of Night. <br />
  Left far behind were now the faces known, <br />
  The happy silken babble on laughter&#8217;s lips <br />
  And the close-clinging clasp of intimate hands <br />
  And adoration&#8217;s light in cherished eyes <br />
  Offered to the one sovereign of their life. <br />
  Nature&#8217;s primaeval loneliness was here: <br />
  Here only was the voice of bird and beast,&#8211; <br />
  The ascetic&#8217;s exile in the dim-souled huge <br />
  Inhuman forest far from cheerful sound <br />
  Of man&#8217;s blithe converse and his crowded days. <br />
  In a broad eve with one red eye of cloud, <br />
  Through a narrow opening, a green flowered cleft, <br />
  Out of the stare of sky and soil they came <br />
  Into a mighty home of emerald dusk. <br />
  There onward led by a faint brooding path <br />
  Which toiled through the shadow of enormous trunks</p>

<p>And under arches misers of sunshine, <br />
  They saw low thatched roofs of a hermitage <br />
  Huddled beneath a patch of azure hue <br />
  In a sunlit clearing that seemed the outbreak <br />
  Of a glad smile in the forest&#8217;s monstrous heart, <br />
  A rude refuge of the thought and will of man <br />
  Watched by the crowding giants of the wood. <br />
  Arrived in that rough-hewn homestead they gave, <br />
  Questioning no more the strangeness of her fate, <br />
  Their pride and loved one to the great blind king, <br />
  A regal pillar of fallen mightiness <br />
  And the stately care-worn woman once a queen <br />
  Who now hoped nothing for herself from life, <br />
  But all things only hoped for her one child, <br />
  Calling on that single head from partial Fate <br />
  All joy of earth, all heaven&#8217;s beatitude. <br />
  Adoring wisdom and beauty like a young god&#8217;s, <br />
  She saw him loved by heaven as by herself, <br />
  She rejoiced in his brightness and believed in his fate <br />
  And knew not of the evil drawing near. <br />
  Lingering some days upon the forest verge <br />
  Like men who lengthen out departure&#8217;s pain, <br />
  Unwilling to separate sorrowful clinging hands, <br />
  Unwilling to see for the last time a face, <br />
  Heavy with the sorrow of a coming day <br />
  And wondering at the carelessness of Fate <br />
  Who breaks with idle hands her supreme works, <br />
  They parted from her with pain-fraught burdened hearts <br />
  As forced by inescapable fate we part <br />
  From one whom we shall never see again; <br />
  Driven by the singularity of her fate, <br />
  Helpless against the choice of Savitri&#8217;s heart <br />
  They left her to her rapture and her doom <br />
  In the tremendous forest&#8217;s savage charge. <br />
  All put behind her that was once her life, <br />
  All welcomed that henceforth was his and hers,</p>

  As if self-poised above the march of days, <br />
  Her immobile spirit watched the haste of Time, <br />
  A statue of passion and invincible force, <br />
  An absolutism of sweet imperious will, <br />
  A tranquillity and a violence of the gods <br />
  Indomitable and immutable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At first to her beneath the sapphire heavens <br />
  The sylvan solitude was a gorgeous dream, <br />
  An altar of the summer&#8217;s splendour and fire, <br />
  A sky-topped flower-hung palace of the gods <br />
  And all its scenes a smile on rapture&#8217;s lips <br />
  And all its voices bards of happiness. <br />
  There was a chanting in the casual wind, <br />
  There was a glory in the least sunbeam; <br />
  Night was a chrysoprase on velvet cloth, <br />
  A nestling darkness or a moonlit deep; <br />
  Day was a purple pageant and a hymn, <br />
  A wave of the laughter of light from morn to eve. <br />
  His absence was a dream of memory, <br />
  His presence was the empire of a god. <br />
  A fusing of the joys of earth and heaven, <br />
  A tremulous blaze of nuptial rapture passed, <br />
  A rushing of two spirits to be one, <br />
  A burning of two bodies in one flame. <br />
  Opened were gates of unforgettable bliss: <br />
  Two lives were locked within an earthly heaven <br />
  And fate and grief fled from that fiery hour. <br />
  But soon now failed the summer&#8217;s ardent breath <br />
  And throngs of blue-black clouds crept through the sky <br />
  And rain fled sobbing over the dripping leaves <br />
  And storm became the forest&#8217;s titan voice. <br />
  Then listening to the thunder&#8217;s fatal crash</p>

<p>And the fugitive pattering footsteps of the showers <br />
  And the long unsatisfied panting of the wind <br />
  And sorrow muttering in the sound-vexed night, <br />
  The grief of all the world came near to her. <br />
  Night&#8217;s darkness seemed her future&#8217;s ominous face. <br />
  The shadow of her lover&#8217;s doom arose <br />
  And fear laid hands upon her mortal heart. <br />
  The moments swift and ruthless raced; alarmed <br />
  Her thoughts, her mind remembered Narad&#8217;s date. <br />
  A trembling moved accountant of her riches, <br />
  She reckoned the insufficient days between: <br />
  A dire expectancy knocked at her breast; <br />
  Dreadful to her were the footsteps of the hours: <br />
  Grief came, a passionate stranger to her gate: <br />
  Banished when in his arms, out of her sleep <br />
  It rose at morn to look into her face. <br />
  Vainly she fled into abysms of bliss <br />
  From her pursuing foresight of the end. <br />
  The more she plunged into love that anguish grew; <br />
  Her deepest grief from sweetest gulfs arose. <br />
  Remembrance was a poignant pang, she felt <br />
  Each day a golden leaf torn cruelly out <br />
  From her too slender book of love and joy. <br />
  Thus swaying in strong gusts of happiness <br />
  And swimming in foreboding&#8217;s sombre waves <br />
  And feeding sorrow and terror with her heart,&#8211; <br />
  For now they sat among her bosom&#8217;s guests <br />
  Or in her inner chamber paced apart,&#8211; <br />
  Her eyes stared blind into the future&#8217;s night. <br />
  Out of her separate self she looked and saw, <br />
  Moving amid the unconscious faces loved, <br />
  In mind a stranger though in heart so near, <br />
  The ignorant smiling world go happily by <br />
  Upon its way towards an unknown doom <br />
  And wondered at the careless lives of men. <br />
  As if in different worlds they walked, though close,</p>

<p>They confident of the returning sun, <br />
  They wrapped in little hourly hopes and tasks,&#8211; <br />
  She in her dreadful knowledge was alone. <br />
  The rich and happy secrecy that once <br />
  Enshrined her as if in a silver bower <br />
  Apart in a bright nest of thoughts and dreams <br />
  Made room for tragic hours of solitude <br />
  And lonely grief that none could share or know, <br />
  A body seeing the end too soon of joy <br />
  And the fragile happiness of its mortal love. <br />
  Her quiet visage still and sweet and calm, <br />
  Her graceful daily acts were now a mask; <br />
  In vain she looked upon her depths to find <br />
  A ground of stillness and the spirit&#8217;s peace. <br />
  Still veiled from her was the silent Being within <br />
  Who sees life&#8217;s drama pass with unmoved eyes, <br />
  Supports the sorrow of the mind and heart <br />
  And bears in human breasts the world and fate. <br />
  A glimpse or flashes came, the Presence was hid. <br />
  Only her violent heart and passionate will <br />
  Were pushed in front to meet the immutable doom; <br />
  Defenceless, nude, bound to her human lot <br />
  They had no means to act, no way to save. <br />
  These she controlled, nothing was shown outside: <br />
  She was still to them the child they knew and loved; <br />
  The sorrowing woman they saw not within. <br />
  No change was in her beautiful motions seen: <br />
  A worshipped empress all once vied to serve, <br />
  She made herself the diligent serf of all, <br />
  Nor spared the labour of broom and jar and well, <br />
  Or close gentle tending or to heap the fire <br />
  Of altar and kitchen, no slight task allowed <br />
  To others that her woman&#8217;s strength might do. <br />
  In all her acts a strange divinity shone: <br />
  Into a simplest movement she could bring <br />
  A oneness with earth&#8217;s glowing robe of light, <br />
  A lifting up of common acts by love.</p>

<p>All-love was hers and its one heavenly cord <br />
  Bound all to all with her as golden tie. <br />
  But when her grief to the surface pressed too close, <br />
  These things, once gracious adjuncts of her joy, <br />
  Seemed meaningless to her, a gleaming shell, <br />
  Or were a round mechanical and void, <br />
  Her body&#8217;s actions shared not by her will. <br />
  Always behind this strange divided life <br />
  Her spirit like a sea of living fire <br />
  Possessed her lover and to his body clung, <br />
  One locked embrace to guard its threatened mate. <br />
  At night she woke through the slow silent hours <br />
  Brooding on the treasure of his bosom and face, <br />
  Hung o&#8217;er the sleep-bound beauty of his brow <br />
  Or laid her burning cheek upon his feet. <br />
  Waking at morn her lips endlessly clung to his, <br />
  Unwilling ever to separate again <br />
  Or lose that honeyed drain of lingering joy, <br />
  Unwilling to loose his body from her breast, <br />
  The warm inadequate signs that love must use. <br />
  Intolerant of the poverty of Time <br />
  Her passion catching at the fugitive hours <br />
  Willed the expense of centuries in one day <br />
  Of prodigal love and the surf of ecstasy; <br />
  Or else she strove even in mortal time <br />
  To build a little room for timelessness <br />
  By the deep union of two human lives, <br />
  Her soul secluded shut into his soul. <br />
  After all was given she demanded still; <br />
  Even by his strong embrace unsatisfied, <br />
  She longed to cry, &#8220;O tender Satyavan, <br />
  O lover of my soul, give more, give more <br />
  Of love while yet thou canst, to her thou lov&#8217;st. <br />
  Imprint thyself for every nerve to keep <br />
  That thrills to thee the message of my heart. <br />
  For soon we part and who shall know how long <br />
  Before the great wheel in its monstrous round</p>

<p>Restore us to each other and our love?&#8221; <br />
  Too well she loved to speak a fateful word <br />
  And lay her burden on his happy head; <br />
  She pressed the outsurging grief back into her breast <br />
  To dwell within silent, unhelped, alone. <br />
  But Satyavan sometimes half understood, <br />
  Or felt at least with the uncertain answer <br />
  Of our thought-blinded hearts the unuttered need, <br />
  The unplumbed abyss of her deep passionate want. <br />
  All of his speeding days that he could spare <br />
  From labour in the forest hewing wood <br />
  And hunting food in the wild sylvan glades <br />
  And service to his father&#8217;s sightless life <br />
  He gave to her and helped to increase the hours <br />
  By the nearness of his presence and his clasp, <br />
  And lavish softness of heart-seeking words <br />
  And the close beating felt of heart on heart. <br />
  All was too little for her bottomless need. <br />
  If in his presence she forgot awhile, <br />
  Grief filled his absence with its aching touch; <br />
  She saw the desert of her coming days <br />
  Imaged in every solitary hour. <br />
  Although with a vain imaginary bliss <br />
  Of fiery union through death&#8217;s door of escape <br />
  She dreamed of her body robed in funeral flame, <br />
  She knew she must not clutch that happiness <br />
  To die with him and follow, seizing his robe <br />
  Across our other countries, travellers glad <br />
  Into the sweet or terrible Beyond. <br />
  For those sad parents still would need her here <br />
  To help the empty remnant of their day. <br />
  Often it seemed to her the ages&#8217; pain <br />
  Had pressed their quintessence into her single woe, <br />
  Concentrating in her a tortured world. <br />
  Thus in the silent chamber of her soul <br />
  Cloistering her love to live with secret grief <br />
  She dwelt like a dumb priest with hidden gods</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Unappeased by the wordless offering of her days, <br />
  Lifting to them her sorrow like frankincense, <br />
  Her life the altar, herself the sacrifice. <br />
  Yet ever they grew into each other more <br />
  Until it seemed no power could rend apart, <br />
  Since even the body&#8217;s walls could not divide. <br />
  For when he wandered in the forest, oft <br />
  Her conscious spirit walked with him and knew <br />
  His actions as if in herself he moved; <br />
  He, less aware, thrilled with her from afar. <br />
  Always the stature of her passion grew; <br />
  Grief, fear became the food of mighty love. <br />
  Increased by its torment it filled the whole world; <br />
  It was all her life, became her whole earth and heaven. <br />
  Although life-born, an infant of the hours, <br />
  Immortal it walked unslayable as the gods: <br />
  Her spirit stretched measureless in strength divine, <br />
  An anvil for the blows of Fate and Time: <br />
  Or tired of sorrow&#8217;s passionate luxury, <br />
  Grief&#8217;s self became calm, dull-eyed, resolute, <br />
  Awaiting some issue of its fiery struggle, <br />
  Some deed in which it might for ever cease, <br />
  Victorious over itself and death and tears. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The year now paused upon the brink of change. <br />
  No more the storms sailed with stupendous wings <br />
  And thunder strode in wrath across the world, <br />
  But still was heard a muttering in the sky <br />
  And rain dripped wearily through the mournful air <br />
  And grey slow-drifting clouds shut in the earth. <br />
  So her grief&#8217;s heavy sky shut in her heart. <br />
  A still self hid behind but gave no light: <br />
  No voice came down from the forgotten heights; <br />
  Only in the privacy of its brooding pain <br />
  Her human heart spoke to the body&#8217;s fate. </p>
