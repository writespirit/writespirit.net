  </td>
<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">&nbsp;A silence sealed the irrevocable decree, <br />
  The word of Fate that fell from heavenly lips <br />
  Fixing a doom no power could ever reverse <br />
  Unless heaven&#8217;s will itself could change its course. <br />
  Or so it seemed: yet from the silence rose <br />
  One voice that questioned changeless destiny, <br />
  A will that strove against the immutable Will. <br />
  A mother&#8217;s heart had heard the fateful speech <br />
  That rang like a sanction to the call of death <br />
  And came like a chill close to life and hope. <br />
  Yet hope sank down like an extinguished fire. <br />
  She felt the leaden inevitable hand <br />
  Invade the secrecy of her guarded soul <br />
  And smite with sudden pain its still content <br />
  And the empire of her hard-won quietude. <br />
  Awhile she fell to the level of human mind, <br />
  A field of mortal grief and Nature&#8217;s law; <br />
  She shared, she bore the common lot of men <br />
  And felt what common hearts endure in Time. <br />
  Voicing earth&#8217;s question to the inscrutable power <br />
  The queen now turned to the still immobile seer: <br />
  Assailed by the discontent in Nature&#8217;s depths, <br />
  Partner in the agony of dumb driven things <br />
  And all the misery, all the ignorant cry, <br />
  Passionate like sorrow questioning heaven she spoke. <br />
  Lending her speech to the surface soul on earth <br />
  She uttered the suffering in the world&#8217;s dumb heart <br />
  And man&#8217;s revolt against his ignorant fate. <br />
  &#8220;O seer, in the earth&#8217;s strange twi-natured life <br />
  By what pitiless adverse Necessity <br />
  Or what cold freak of a Creator&#8217;s will,</td>

<p>By what random accident or governed Chance <br />
  That shaped a rule out of fortuitous steps, <br />
  Made destiny from an hour&#8217;s emotion, came <br />
  Into the unreadable mystery of Time <br />
  The direr mystery of grief and pain? <br />
  Is it thy God who made this cruel law? <br />
  Or some disastrous Power has marred his work <br />
  And he stands helpless to defend or save? <br />
  A fatal seed was sown in life&#8217;s false start <br />
  When evil twinned with good on earthly soil. <br />
  Then first appeared the malady of mind, <br />
  Its pang of thought, its quest for the aim of life. <br />
  It twisted into forms of good and ill <br />
  The frank simplicity of the animal&#8217;s acts; <br />
  It turned the straight path hewn by the body&#8217;s gods, <br />
  Followed the zigzag of the uncertain course <br />
  Of life that wanders seeking for its aim <br />
  In the pale starlight falling from thought&#8217;s skies, <br />
  Its guides the unsure idea, the wavering will. <br />
  Lost was the instinct&#8217;s safe identity <br />
  With the arrow-point of being&#8217;s inmost sight, <br />
  Marred the sure steps of Nature&#8217;s simple walk <br />
  And truth and freedom in the growing soul. <br />
  Out of some ageless innocence and peace, <br />
  Privilege of souls not yet betrayed to birth, <br />
  Cast down to suffer on this hard dangerous earth <br />
  Our life was born in pain and with a cry. <br />
  Although earth-nature welcomes heaven&#8217;s breath <br />
  Inspiring Matter with the will to live, <br />
  A thousand ills assail the mortal&#8217;s hours <br />
  And wear away the natural joy of life; <br />
  Our bodies are an engine cunningly made, <br />
  But for all its parts as cunningly are planned, <br />
  Contrived ingeniously with demon skill, <br />
  Its apt inevitable heritage <br />
  Of mortal danger and peculiar pain,</p>

<p>Its payment of the tax of Time and Fate, <br />
  Its way to suffer and its way to die. <br />
  This is the ransom of our high estate, <br />
  The sign and stamp of our humanity. <br />
  A grisly company of maladies <br />
  Come, licensed lodgers, into man&#8217;s bodily house, <br />
  Purveyors of death and torturers of life. <br />
  In the malignant hollows of the world, <br />
  In its subconscient cavern-passages <br />
  Ambushed they lie waiting their hour to leap, <br />
  Surrounding with danger the sieged city of life: <br />
  Admitted into the citadel of man&#8217;s days <br />
  They mine his force and maim or suddenly kill. <br />
  Ourselves within us lethal forces nurse; <br />
  We make of our own enemies our guests: <br />
  Out of their holes like beasts they creep and gnaw <br />
  The chords of the divine musician&#8217;s lyre <br />
  Till frayed and thin the music dies away <br />
  Or crashing snaps with a last tragic note. <br />
  All that we are is like a fort beset: <br />
  All that we strive to be alters like a dream <br />
  In the grey sleep of Matter&#8217;s ignorance. <br />
  Mind suffers lamed by the world&#8217;s disharmony <br />
  And the unloveliness of human things. <br />
  A treasure misspent or cheaply, fruitlessly sold <br />
  In the bazaar of a blind destiny, <br />
  A gift of priceless value from Time&#8217;s gods <br />
  Lost or mislaid in an uncaring world, <br />
  Life is a marvel missed, an art gone wry; <br />
  A seeker in a dark and obscure place, <br />
  An ill-armed warrior facing dreadful odds, <br />
  An imperfect worker given a baffling task, <br />
  An ignorant judge of problems Ignorance made, <br />
  Its heavenward flights reach closed and keyless gates, <br />
  Its glorious outbursts peter out in mire. <br />
  On Nature&#8217;s gifts to man a curse was laid:</p>

<p>All walks inarmed by its own opposites, <br />
  Error is the comrade of our mortal thought <br />
  And falsehood lurks in the deep bosom of truth, <br />
  Sin poisons with its vivid flowers of joy <br />
  Or leaves a red scar burnt across the soul; <br />
  Virtue is a grey bondage and a gaol. <br />

  A growing register of calamities <br />
  Is the past&#8217;s account, the future&#8217;s book of Fate: <br />
  The centuries pile man&#8217;s follies and man&#8217;s crimes <br />
  Upon the countless crowd of Nature&#8217;s ills; <br />
  As if the world&#8217;s stone load was not enough, <br />
  A crop of miseries obstinately is sown <br />
  By his own hand in the furrows of the gods, <br />
  The vast increasing tragic harvest reaped <br />
  From old misdeeds buried by oblivious Time. <br />
  He walks by his own choice into Hell&#8217;s trap; <br />
  This mortal creature is his own worst foe. <br />
  His science is an artificer of doom; <br />
  He ransacks earth for means to harm his kind; <br />
  He slays his happiness and others&#8217; good. <br />
  Nothing has he learned from Time and its history; <br />
  Even as of old in the raw youth of Time, <br />
  When Earth ignorant ran on the highways of Fate, <br />
  Old forms of evil cling to the world&#8217;s soul: <br />
  War making nought the sweet smiling calm of life, <br />
  Battle and rapine, ruin and massacre <br />
  Are still the fierce pastimes of man&#8217;s warring tribes; <br />
  An idiot hour destroys what centuries made, <br />
  His wanton rage or frenzied hate lays low <br />
  The beauty and greatness by his genius wrought <br />
  And the mighty output of a nation&#8217;s toil. <br />
  All he has achieved he drags to the precipice.</p>

<p>His grandeur he turns to an epic of doom and fall; <br />
  His littleness crawls content through squalor and mud, <br />
  He calls heaven&#8217;s retribution on his head <br />
  And wallows in his self-made misery. <br />
  A part author of the cosmic tragedy, <br />
  His will conspires with death and time and fate. <br />
  His brief appearance on the enigmaed earth <br />

  If to some being of eternal bliss <br />
  It is our spirit&#8217;s destiny to return <br />
  Or some still impersonal height of endless calm, <br />
  Since That we are and out of That we came, <br />
  Whence rose the strange and sterile interlude <br />
  Lasting in vain through interminable Time? <br />
  Who willed to form or feign a universe <br />
  In the cold and endless emptiness of Space? <br />
  Or if these beings must be and their brief lives, <br />
  What need had the soul of ignorance and tears? <br />
  Whence rose the call for sorrow and for pain? <br />
  Or all came helplessly without a cause? <br />
  What power forced the immortal spirit to birth? <br />
  The eternal witness once of eternity, <br />
  A deathless sojourner mid transient scenes, <br />
  He camps in life&#8217;s half-lit obscurity <br />
  Amid the debris of his thoughts and dreams. <br />
  Or who persuaded it to fall from bliss <br />
  And forfeit its immortal privilege? <br />
  Who laid on it the ceaseless will to live</p>

  A Light shines there nor pain nor grief can cross. <br />
  A darkness stands between thyself and him, <br />

  Thou canst not see the beatific sun. <br />

  Its brilliant curtain hides from thee God&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>It illumes a world born from the Inconscience <br />
  But hides the Immortal&#8217;s meaning in the world. <br />
  Thy mind&#8217;s light hides from thee the Eternal&#8217;s thought, <br />
  Thy heart&#8217;s hopes hide from thee the Eternal&#8217;s will, <br />
  Earth&#8217;s joys shut from thee the Immortal&#8217;s bliss. <br />
  Thence rose the need of a dark intruding god, <br />
  The world&#8217;s dread teacher, the creator, pain. <br />
  Where Ignorance is, there suffering too must come; <br />
  Thy grief is a cry of darkness to the Light; <br />
  Pain was the first-born of the Inconscience <br />
  Which was thy body&#8217;s dumb original base; <br />
  Already slept there pain&#8217;s subconscient shape: <br />
  A shadow in a shadowy tenebrous womb, <br />
  Till life shall move, it waits to wake and be. <br />
  In one caul with joy came forth the dreadful Power. <br />
  In life&#8217;s breast it was born hiding its twin; <br />
  But pain came first, then only joy could be. <br />
  Pain ploughed the first hard ground of the world-drowse. <br />
  By pain a spirit started from the clod, <br />
  By pain Life stirred in the subliminal deep. <br />
  Interned, submerged, hidden in Matter&#8217;s trance <br />
  Awoke to itself the dreamer, sleeping Mind; <br />
  It made a visible realm out of its dreams, <br />
  It drew its shapes from the subconscient depths, <br />
  Then turned to look upon the world it had made. <br />
  By pain and joy, the bright and tenebrous twins, <br />
  The inanimate world perceived its sentient soul, <br />
  Else had the Inconscient never suffered change. <br />
  Pain is the hammer of the Gods to break <br />
  A dead resistance in the mortal&#8217;s heart, <br />
  His slow inertia as of living stone. <br />
  If the heart were not forced to want and weep, <br />
  His soul would have lain down content, at ease, <br />
  And never thought to exceed the human start <br />
  And never learned to climb towards the Sun. <br />
  This earth is full of labour, packed with pain;</p>

<p>Throes of an endless birth coerce her still; <br />
  The centuries end, the ages vainly pass <br />
  And yet the Godhead in her is not born. <br />
  The ancient Mother faces all with joy, <br />
  Calls for the ardent pang, the grandiose thrill; <br />
  For with pain and labour all creation comes. <br />
  This earth is full of the anguish of the gods; <br />
  Ever they travail driven by Time&#8217;s goad, <br />
  And strive to work out the eternal Will <br />
  And shape the life divine in mortal forms. <br />
  His will must be worked out in human breasts <br />
  Against the Evil that rises from the gulfs, <br />
  Against the world&#8217;s Ignorance and its obstinate strength, <br />
  Against the stumblings of man&#8217;s pervert will, <br />
  Against the deep folly of his human mind, <br />
  Against the blind reluctance of his heart. <br />
  The spirit is doomed to pain till man is free. <br />
  There is a clamour of battle, a tramp, a march: <br />
  A cry arises like a moaning sea, <br />
  A desperate laughter under the blows of death, <br />
  A doom of blood and sweat and toil and tears. <br />
  Men die that man may live and God be born. <br />
  An awful Silence watches tragic Time. <br />
  Pain is the hand of Nature sculpturing men <br />
  To greatness: an inspired labour chisels <br />
  With heavenly cruelty an unwilling mould. <br />
  Implacable in the passion of their will, <br />
  Lifting the hammers of titanic toil <br />
  The demiurges of the universe work; <br />
  They shape with giant strokes their own; their sons <br />
  Are marked with their enormous stamp of fire. <br />
  Although the shaping god&#8217;s tremendous touch <br />
  Is torture unbearable to mortal nerves, <br />
  The fiery spirit grows in strength within <br />
  And feels a joy in every titan pang. <br />
  He who would save himself lives bare and calm;</p>

<p>He who would save the race must share its pain: <br />
  This he shall know who obeys that grandiose urge. <br />
  The Great who came to save this suffering world <br />
  And rescue out of Time&#8217;s shadow and the Law, <br />
  Must pass beneath the yoke of grief and pain; <br />
  They are caught by the Wheel that they had hoped to break, <br />
  On their shoulders they must bear man&#8217;s load of fate. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s riches they bring, their sufferings count the price <br />
  Or they pay the gift of knowledge with their lives. <br />
  The Son of God born as the Son of man <br />
  Has drunk the bitter cup, owned Godhead&#8217;s debt, <br />
  The debt the Eternal owes to the fallen kind <br />
  His will has bound to death and struggling life <br />
  That yearns in vain for rest and endless peace. <br />
  Now is the debt paid, wiped off the original score. <br />
  The Eternal suffers in a human form, <br />
  He has signed salvation&#8217;s testament with his blood: <br />
  He has opened the doors of his undying peace. <br />
  The Deity compensates the creature&#8217;s claim, <br />
  The Creator bears the law of pain and death; <br />
  A retribution smites the incarnate God. <br />
  His love has paved the mortal&#8217;s road to Heaven: <br />
  He has given his life and light to balance here <br />
  The dark account of mortal ignorance. <br />
  It is finished, the dread mysterious sacrifice, <br />
  Offered by God&#8217;s martyred body for the world; <br />
  Gethsemane and Calvary are his lot, <br />
  He carries the cross on which man&#8217;s soul is nailed; <br />
  His escort is the curses of the crowd; <br />
  Insult and jeer are his right&#8217;s acknowledgment; <br />
  Two thieves slain with him mock his mighty death. <br />
  He has trod with bleeding brow the Saviour&#8217;s way. <br />
  He who has found his identity with God <br />
  Pays with the body&#8217;s death his soul&#8217;s vast light. <br />
  His knowledge immortal triumphs by his death. <br />

  The sorrow of all living things shall come <br />
  And knock at his doors and live within his house; <br />
  A dreadful cord of sympathy can tie <br />
  All suffering into his single grief and make <br />
  All agony in all the worlds his own. <br />

  Its dark and potent nescience was earth&#8217;s start; <br />
  It is the waste stuff from which all was made; <br />
  Into its deeps creation can collapse. <br />
  Its opposition clogs the march of the soul, <br />
  It is the mother of our ignorance. <br />
  He must call light into its dark abysms, <br />
  Else never can Truth conquer Matter&#8217;s sleep <br />
  And all earth look into the eyes of God. <br />
  All things obscure his knowledge must relume, <br />
  All things perverse his power must unknot: <br />
  He must pass to the other shore of falsehood&#8217;s sea, <br />
  He must enter the world&#8217;s dark to bring there light. <br />
  The heart of evil must be bared to his eyes, <br />
  He must learn its cosmic dark necessity, <br />
  Its right and its dire roots in Nature&#8217;s soil. <br />
  He must know the thought that moves the demon act <br />
  And justifies the Titan&#8217;s erring pride <br />
  And the falsehood lurking in earth&#8217;s crooked dreams: <br />
  He must enter the eternity of Night <br />
  And know God&#8217;s darkness as he knows his Sun. <br />
  For this he must go down into the pit, <br />
  For this he must invade the dolorous Vasts. <br />
  Imperishable and wise and infinite, <br />
  He still must travel Hell the world to save. <br />
  Into the eternal Light he shall emerge <br />
  On borders of the meeting of all worlds; <br />
  There on the verge of Nature&#8217;s summit steps</p>

  In thy hard passage through a suffering world <br />
  Lean for thy soul&#8217;s support on Heaven&#8217;s strength, <br />
  Turn towards high Truth, aspire to love and peace. <br />
  A little bliss is lent thee from above, <br />
  A touch divine upon thy human days. <br />
  Make of thy daily way a pilgrimage, <br />
  For through small joys and griefs thou mov&#8217;st towards God. <br />
  Haste not towards Godhead on a dangerous road, <br />
  Open not thy doorways to a nameless Power, <br />
  Climb not to Godhead by the Titan&#8217;s road. <br />
  Against the Law he pits his single will, <br />
  Across its way he throws his pride of might. <br />
  Heavenward he clambers on a stair of storms</p>

  His eyes blinded and visionless stare at the sun, <br />

  He sees the beyond as an emptiness void of soul <br />
  And takes his night for a dark infinite. <br />

  Unburdened by life&#8217;s blind mystery of pain: <br />
  Pain is the signature of the Ignorance <br />
  Attesting the secret god denied by life: <br />
  Until life finds him pain can never end. <br />
  Calm is self&#8217;s victory overcoming fate. <br />

  It sensed a negative infinity, <br />

  Offered a ground for Nature&#8217;s adverse birth <br />
  And Matter&#8217;s rigid hard unconsciousness <br />
  Harbouring the brilliance of a transient soul <br />
  That lights up birth and death and ignorant life.</p>

  A huge descent began, a giant fall: <br />
  For what the spirit sees, creates a truth <br />
  And what the soul imagines is made a world. <br />
  A Thought that leaped from the Timeless can become, <br />
  Indicator of cosmic consequence <br />
  And the itinerary of the gods, <br />
  A cyclic movement in eternal Time. <br />
  Thus came, born from a blind tremendous choice, <br />
  This great perplexed and discontented world, <br />
  This haunt of Ignorance, this home of Pain: <br />
  There are pitched desire&#8217;s tents, grief&#8217;s headquarters. <br />

  But what is Fate if not the spirit&#8217;s will <br />

  &#8220;O Aswapati, random seem the ways <br />
  Along whose banks your footsteps stray or run <br />
  In casual hours or moments of the gods, <br />
  Yet your least stumblings are foreseen above. <br />
  Infallibly the curves of life are drawn <br />
  Following the stream of Time through the unknown; <br />
  They are led by a clue the calm immortals keep. <br />
  This blazoned hieroglyph of prophet morns <br />
  A meaning more sublime in symbols writes <br />
  Than sealed Thought wakes to, but of this high script <br />
  How shall my voice convince the mind of earth? <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s wiser love rejects the mortal&#8217;s prayer; <br />
  Unblinded by the breath of his desire, <br />
  Unclouded by the mists of fear and hope,</p>

  It keeps for her her privilege of pain. <br />
  A greatness in thy daughter&#8217;s soul resides <br />
  That can transform herself and all around <br />
  But must cross on stones of suffering to its goal. <br />
  Although designed like a nectar cup of heaven, <br />
  Of heavenly ether made she sought this air, <br />
  She too must share the human need of grief <br />
  And all her cause of joy transmute to pain. <br />
  The mind of mortal man is led by words, <br />
  His sight retires behind the walls of Thought <br />
  And looks out only through half-opened doors. <br />
  He cuts the boundless Truth into sky-strips <br />
  And every strip he takes for all the heavens. <br />
  He stares at infinite possibility <br />
  And gives to the plastic Vast the name of Chance; <br />
  He sees the long results of an all-wise Force <br />
  Planning a sequence of steps in endless Time <br />
  But in its links imagines a senseless chain <br />
  Or the dead hand of cold Necessity; <br />
  He answers not to the mystic Mother&#8217;s heart, <br />
  Misses the ardent heavings of her breast <br />
  And feels cold rigid limbs of lifeless Law. <br />

  And while they last, all things by them are bound; <br />
  But the spirit&#8217;s consent is needed for each act <br />
  And Freedom walks in the same pace with Law. <br />
  All here can change if the Magician choose. <br />
  If human will could be made one with God&#8217;s, <br />
  If human thought could echo the thoughts of God, <br />
  Man might be all-knowing and omnipotent; <br />

  Thy goal, the road thou choosest are thy fate. <br />
  On the altar throwing thy thoughts, thy heart, thy works, <br />
  Thy fate is a long sacrifice to the gods <br />
  Till they have opened to thee thy secret self <br />
  And made thee one with the indwelling God. <br />
  O soul, intruder in Nature&#8217;s ignorance, <br />
  Armed traveller to the unseen supernal heights, <br />
  Thy spirit&#8217;s fate is a battle and ceaseless march <br />
  Against invisible opponent Powers, <br />
  A passage from Matter into timeless self.</p>

  It sits apart with grief and facing death, <br />
  Affronting adverse fate armed and alone. <br />
  In this enormous world standing apart <br />
  In the mightiness of her silent spirit&#8217;s will, <br />
  In the passion of her soul of sacrifice <br />
  Her lonely strength facing the universe, <br />
  Affronting fate, asks not man&#8217;s help nor god&#8217;s: <br />
  Sometimes one life is charged with earth&#8217;s destiny, <br />
  It cries not for succour from the time-bound powers. <br />
  Alone she is equal to her mighty task. <br />
  Intervene not in a strife too great for thee, <br />
  A struggle too deep for mortal thought to sound, <br />
  Its question to this Nature&#8217;s rigid bounds <br />
  When the soul fronts nude of garbs the infinite, <br />
  Its too vast theme of a lonely mortal will <br />
  Pacing the silence of eternity. <br />
  As a star, uncompanioned, moves in heaven <br />
  Unastonished by the immensities of Space, <br />
  Travelling infinity by its own light, <br />
  The great are strongest when they stand alone. <br />
  A God-given might of being is their force, <br />
  A ray from self&#8217;s solitude of light the guide; <br />
  The soul that can live alone with itself meets God;</p>

<p>Its lonely universe is their rendezvous. <br />
  A day may come when she must stand unhelped <br />
  On a dangerous brink of the world&#8217;s doom and hers, <br />
  Carrying the world&#8217;s future on her lonely breast, <br />
  Carrying the human hope in a heart left sole <br />
  To conquer or fail on a last desperate verge, <br />
  Alone with death and close to extinction&#8217;s edge. <br />
  Her single greatness in that last dire scene <br />
  Must cross alone a perilous bridge in Time <br />
  And reach an apex of world-destiny <br />
  Where all is won or all is lost for man. <br />
  In that tremendous silence lone and lost <br />
  Of a deciding hour in the world&#8217;s fate, <br />
  In her soul&#8217;s climbing beyond mortal time <br />
  When she stands sole with Death or sole with God <br />
  Apart upon a silent desperate brink, <br />
  Alone with her self and death and destiny <br />
  As on some verge between Time and Timelessness <br />
  When being must end or life rebuild its base, <br />
  Alone she must conquer or alone must fall. <br />
  No human aid can reach her in that hour, <br />
  No armoured god stand shining at her side. <br />
  Cry not to heaven, for she alone can save. <br />
  For this the silent Force came missioned down; <br />
  In her the conscious Will took human shape: <br />
  She only can save herself and save the world. <br />
  O queen, stand back from that stupendous scene, <br />
  Come not between her and her hour of Fate. <br />
  Her hour must come and none can intervene: <br />
  Think not to turn her from her heaven-sent task, <br />
  Strive not to save her from her own high will. <br />
  Thou hast no place in that tremendous strife; <br />
  Thy love and longing are not arbiters there; <br />
  Leave the world&#8217;s fate and her to God&#8217;s sole guard. <br />
  Even if he seems to leave her to her lone strength, <br />
  Even though all falters and falls and sees an end</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke and ceased and left the earthly scene. <br />
  Away from the strife and suffering on our globe, <br />
  He turned towards his far-off blissful home. <br />
  A brilliant arrow pointing straight to heaven, <br />
  The luminous body of the ethereal seer <br />
  Assailed the purple glory of the noon <br />
  And disappeared like a receding star <br />
  Vanishing into the light of the Unseen. <br />
  But still a cry was heard in the infinite, <br />
  And still to the listening soul on mortal earth <br />
  A high and far imperishable voice <br />
  Chanted the anthem of eternal love.</p>
