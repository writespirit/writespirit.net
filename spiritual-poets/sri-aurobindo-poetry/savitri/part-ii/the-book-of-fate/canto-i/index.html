<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">&nbsp;In silent bounds bordering the mortal&#8217;s plane <br />
  Crossing a wide expanse of brilliant peace <br />
  Narad the heavenly sage from Paradise <br />
  Came chanting through the large and lustrous air. <br />
  Attracted by the golden summer-earth <br />
  That lay beneath him like a glowing bowl <br />
  Tilted upon a table of the Gods, <br />
  Turning as if moved round by an unseen hand <br />
  To catch the warmth and blaze of a small sun, <br />
  He passed from the immortals&#8217; happy paths <br />
  To a world of toil and quest and grief and hope, <br />
  To these rooms of the see-saw game of death with life. <br />
  Across an intangible border of soul-space <br />
  He passed from Mind into material things <br />
  Amid the inventions of the inconscient Self <br />
  And the workings of a blind somnambulist Force. <br />
  Below him circling burned the myriad suns: <br />
  He bore the ripples of the etheric sea; <br />
  A primal Air brought the first joy of touch; <br />
  A secret Spirit drew its mighty breath <br />
  Contracting and expanding this huge world <br />
  In its formidable circuit through the Void; <br />
  The secret might of the creative Fire <br />
  Displayed its triple power to build and form, <br />
  Its infinitesimal wave-sparks&#8217; weaving dance, <br />
  Its nebulous units grounding shape and mass, <br />
  Magic foundation and pattern of a world, <br />
  Its radiance bursting into the light of stars; <br />
  He felt a sap of life, a sap of death; <br />
  Into solid Matter&#8217;s dense communion <br />
  Plunging and its obscure oneness of forms</td>

<p>He shared with a dumb Spirit identity. <br />
  He beheld the cosmic Being at his task, <br />
  His eyes measured the spaces, gauged the depths, <br />
  His inner gaze the movements of the soul, <br />
  He saw the eternal labour of the Gods, <br />
  And looked upon the life of beasts and men. <br />
  A change now fell upon the singer&#8217;s mood, <br />
  A rapture and a pathos moved his voice; <br />
  He sang no more of Light that never wanes, <br />
  And oneness and pure everlasting bliss, <br />
  He sang no more the deathless heart of Love, <br />
  His chant was a hymn of Ignorance and Fate. <br />
  He sang the name of Vishnu and the birth <br />
  And joy and passion of the mystic world, <br />
  And how the stars were made and life began <br />
  And the mute regions stirred with the throb of a Soul. <br />
  He sang the Inconscient and its secret self, <br />
  Its power omnipotent knowing not what it does, <br />
  All-shaping without will or thought or sense, <br />
  Its blind unerring occult mystery, <br />
  And darkness yearning towards the eternal Light, <br />
  And Love that broods within the dim abyss <br />
  And waits the answer of the human heart, <br />
  And death that climbs to immortality. <br />
  He sang of the Truth that cries from Night&#8217;s blind deeps, <br />
  And the Mother-Wisdom hid in Nature&#8217;s breast <br />
  And the Idea that through her dumbness works <br />
  And the miracle of her transforming hands, <br />
  Of life that slumbers in the stone and sun <br />
  And Mind subliminal in mindless life, <br />
  And the Consciousness that wakes in beasts and men. <br />
  He sang of the glory and marvel still to be born, <br />
  Of Godhead throwing off at last its veil, <br />
  Of bodies made divine and life made bliss, <br />
  Immortal sweetness clasping immortal might, <br />
  Heart sensing heart, thought looking straight at thought,</p>

<p>And the delight when every barrier falls, <br />
  And the transfiguration and the ecstasy. <br />
  And as he sang the demons wept with joy <br />
  Foreseeing the end of their long dreadful task <br />
  And the defeat for which they hoped in vain, <br />
  And glad release from their self-chosen doom <br />
  And return into the One from whom they came. <br />
  He who has conquered the Immortals&#8217; seats, <br />
  Came down to men on earth the Man divine. <br />
  As darts a lightning streak, a glory fell <br />
  Nearing until the rapt eyes of the sage <br />
  Looked out from luminous cloud and, strangely limned, <br />
  His face, a beautiful mask of antique joy, <br />
  Appearing in light descended where arose <br />
  King Aswapati&#8217;s palace to the winds <br />
  In Madra, flowering up in delicate stone. <br />
  There welcomed him the sage and thoughtful king, <br />
  At his side a creature beautiful, passionate, wise, <br />
  Aspiring like a sacrificial flame <br />
  Skyward from its earth-seat through luminous air, <br />
  Queen-browed, the human mother of Savitri. <br />
  There for an hour untouched by the earth&#8217;s siege <br />
  They ceased from common life and care and sat <br />
  Inclining to the high and rhythmic voice, <br />
  While in his measured chant the heavenly seer <br />
  Spoke of the toils of men and what the gods <br />
  Strive for on earth, and joy that throbs behind <br />
  The marvel and the mystery of pain. <br />
  He sang to them of the lotus-heart of love <br />
  With all its thousand luminous buds of truth, <br />
  Which quivering sleeps veiled by apparent things. <br />
  It trembles at each touch, it strives to wake <br />
  And one day it shall hear a blissful voice <br />
  And in the garden of the Spouse shall bloom <br />
  When she is seized by her discovered lord. <br />
  A mighty shuddering coil of ecstasy</p>

  Transformed and new in her heart&#8217;s miracle-light, <br />
  Saw like a rose of marvel, worshipping, <br />
  The fire-tinged sweetness of the son of Heaven. <br />
  He flung on her his vast immortal look; <br />
  His inner gaze surrounded her with its light <br />
  And reining back knowledge from his immortal lips <br />
  He cried to her, &#8220;Who is this that comes, the bride, <br />
  The flame-born, and round her illumined head <br />
  Pouring their lights her hymeneal pomps <br />
  Move flashing about her? From what green glimmer of glades <br />
  Retreating into dewy silences <br />
  Or half-seen verge of waters moon-betrayed <br />
  Bringst thou this glory of enchanted eyes? <br />
  Earth has gold-hued expanses, shadowy hills <br />
  That cowl their dreaming phantom heads in night, <br />
  And, guarded in a cloistral joy of woods, <br />
  Screened banks sink down into felicity <br />
  Seized by the curved incessant yearning hands <br />
  And ripple-passion of the upgazing stream:</p>

<p>Amid cool-lipped murmurs of its pure embrace <br />
  They lose their souls on beds of trembling reeds. <br />
  And all these are mysterious presences <br />
  In which some spirit&#8217;s immortal bliss is felt, <br />
  And they betray the earth-born heart to joy. <br />
  There hast thou paused, and marvelling borne eyes <br />
  Unknown, or heard a voice that forced thy life <br />
  To strain its rapture through thy listening soul? <br />
  Or, if my thought could trust this shimmering gaze, <br />
  It would say thou hast not drunk from an earthly cup, <br />
  But stepping through azure curtains of the noon <br />
  Thou wast surrounded on a magic verge <br />
  In brighter countries than man&#8217;s eyes can bear. <br />
  Assailed by trooping voices of delight <br />
  And seized mid a sunlit glamour of the boughs <br />
  In faery woods, led down the gleaming slopes <br />
  Of Gandhamadan where the Apsaras roam, <br />
  Thy limbs have shared the sports which none has seen, <br />
  And in god-haunts thy human footsteps strayed, <br />
  Thy mortal bosom quivered with god-speech <br />
  And thy soul answered to a Word unknown. <br />
  What feet of gods, what ravishing flutes of heaven <br />
  Have thrilled high melodies round, from near and far <br />
  Approaching through the soft and revelling air, <br />
  Which still surprised thou hearest? They have fed <br />
  Thy silence on some red strange-ecstasied fruit <br />
  And thou hast trod the dim moon-peaks of bliss. <br />
  Reveal, O winged with light, whence thou hast flown <br />
  Hastening bright-hued through the green tangled earth, <br />
  Thy body rhythmical with the spring-bird&#8217;s call. <br />
  The empty roses of thy hands are filled <br />
  Only with their own beauty and the thrill <br />
  Of a remembered clasp, and in thee glows <br />
  A heavenly jar, thy firm deep-honied heart, <br />
  New-brimming with a sweet and nectarous wine. <br />
  Thou hast not spoken with the kings of pain.</p>

<p>Life&#8217;s perilous music rings yet to thy ear <br />
  Far-melodied, rapid and grand, a Centaur&#8217;s song, <br />
  Or soft as water plashing mid the hills, <br />
  Or mighty as a great chant of many winds. <br />
  Moon-bright thou livest in thy inner bliss. <br />
  Thou comest like a silver deer through groves <br />

  Or fleest like a wind-goddess through leaves, <br />
  Or roamst, O ruby-eyed and snow-winged dove, <br />
  Flitting through thickets of thy pure desires <br />
  In the unwounded beauty of thy soul. <br />
  These things are only images to thy earth, <br />
  But truest truth of that which in thee sleeps. <br />
  For such is thy spirit, a sister of the gods, <br />
  Thy earthly body lovely to the eyes <br />
  And thou art kin in joy to heaven&#8217;s sons. <br />
  O thou who hast come to this great perilous world <br />
  Now only seen through the splendour of thy dreams, <br />
  Where hardly love and beauty can live safe, <br />
  Thyself a being dangerously great, <br />
  A soul alone in a golden house of thought <br />
  Has lived walled in by the safety of thy dreams. <br />
  On heights of happiness leaving doom asleep <br />
  Who hunts unseen the unconscious lives of men, <br />
  If thy heart could live locked in the ideal&#8217;s gold, <br />
  As high, as happy might thy waking be! <br />
  If for all time doom could be left to sleep!&#8221; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke but held his knowledge back from words. <br />
  As a cloud plays with lightnings&#8217; vivid laugh, <br />
  But still holds back the thunder in its heart, <br />
  Only he let bright images escape. <br />
  His speech like glimmering music veiled his thoughts; <br />
  As a wind flatters the bright summer air, <br />
  Pitiful to mortals, only to them it spoke <br />
  Of living beauty and of present bliss: <br />
  He hid in his all-knowing mind the rest.</p>

<p>To those who hearkened to his celestial voice, <br />
  The veil heaven&#8217;s pity throws on future pain <br />
  The Immortals&#8217; sanction seemed of endless joy. <br />
  But Aswapati answered to the seer;&#8211; <br />
  His listening mind had marked the dubious close, <br />
  An ominous shadow felt behind the words, <br />
  But calm like one who ever sits facing Fate <br />
  Here mid the dangerous contours of earth&#8217;s life, <br />
  He answered covert thought with guarded speech: <br />
  &#8220;O deathless sage who knowest all things here, <br />
  If I could read by the ray of my own wish <br />
  Through the carved shield of symbol images <br />
  Which thou hast thrown before thy heavenly mind <br />
  I might see the steps of a young godlike life <br />
  Happily beginning luminous-eyed on earth; <br />
  Between the Unknowable and the Unseen <br />
  Born on the borders of two wonder-worlds, <br />
  It flames out symbols of the infinite <br />
  And lives in a great light of inner suns. <br />
  For it has read and broken the wizard seals; <br />
  It has drunk of the Immortal&#8217;s wells of joy, <br />
  It has looked across the jewel bars of heaven, <br />
  It has entered the aspiring Secrecy, <br />
  It sees beyond terrestrial common things <br />
  And communes with the Powers that build the worlds, <br />
  Till through the shining gates and mystic streets <br />
  Of the city of lapis lazuli and pearl <br />
  Proud deeds step forth, a rank and march of gods. <br />
  Although in pauses of our human lives <br />
  Earth keeps for man some short and perfect hours <br />
  When the inconstant tread of Time can seem <br />
  The eternal moment which the deathless live, <br />
  Yet rare that touch upon the mortal&#8217;s world: <br />
  Hardly a soul and body here are born <br />
  In the fierce difficult movement of the stars, <br />
  Whose life can keep the paradisal note,</p>

  Tirelessly throbbing through the rapturous air <br />
  Caught in the song that sways the Apsara&#8217;s limbs <br />
  When she floats gleaming like a cloud of light, <br />
  A wave of joy on heaven&#8217;s moonstone floor. <br />
  Behold this image cast by light and love, <br />
  A stanza of the ardour of the gods <br />
  Perfectly rhymed, a pillared ripple of gold! <br />
  Her body like a brimmed pitcher of delight <br />
  Shaped in a splendour of gold-coloured bronze <br />
  As if to seize earth&#8217;s truth of hidden bliss. <br />
  Dream-made illumined mirrors are her eyes <br />
  Draped subtly in a slumbrous fringe of jet, <br />
  Retaining heaven&#8217;s reflections in their depths. <br />
  Even as her body, such is she within. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s lustrous mornings gloriously recur, <br />
  Like drops of fire upon a silver page, <br />
  In her young spirit yet untouched with tears. <br />
  All beautiful things eternal seem and new <br />
  To virgin wonder in her crystal soul. <br />
  The unchanging blue reveals its spacious thought; <br />
  Marvellous the moon floats on through wondering skies; <br />

  The charmed mutations of the enchanter life <br />
  Race like bright children past the smiling hours. <br />
  If but this joy of life could last, nor pain <br />
  Throw its bronze note into her rhythmed days! <br />
  Behold her, singer with the prescient gaze, <br />
  And let thy blessing chant that this fair child <br />
  Shall pour the nectar of a sorrowless life <br />
  Around her from her lucid heart of love, <br />
  Heal with her bliss the tired breast of earth <br />
  And cast like a happy snare felicity. <br />
  As grows the great and golden bounteous tree <br />
  Flowering by Alacananda&#8217;s murmuring waves, <br />
  Where with enamoured speed the waters run</p>

<p>Lisping and babbling to the splendour of morn <br />
  And cling with lyric laughter round the knees <br />
  Of heaven&#8217;s daughters dripping magic rain <br />
  Pearl-bright from moon-gold limbs and cloudy hair, <br />
  So are her dawns like jewelled leaves of light, <br />
  So casts she her felicity on men. <br />
  A flame of radiant happiness she was born <br />
  And surely will that flame set earth alight: <br />

  But too often here the careless Mother leaves <br />
  Her chosen in the envious hands of Fate: <br />
  The harp of God falls mute, its call to bliss <br />
  Discouraged fails mid earth&#8217;s unhappy sounds; <br />
  The strings of the siren Ecstasy cry not here <br />
  Or soon are silenced in the human heart. <br />
  Of sorrow&#8217;s songs we have enough: bid once <br />

  Whence came she with this glory in her heart <br />
  And Paradise made visible in her eyes? <br />
  What sudden God has met, what face supreme?&#8221; <br />
  To whom the king, &#8220;The red asoca watched <br />
  Her going forth which now sees her return. <br />
  Arisen into an air of flaming dawn <br />
  Like a bright bird tired of her lonely branch, <br />
  To find her own lord, since to her on earth</p>

<p>He came not yet, this sweetness wandered forth <br />
  Cleaving her way with the beat of her rapid wings. <br />
  Led by a distant call her vague swift flight <br />
  Threaded the summer morns and sunlit lands. <br />
  The happy rest her burdened lashes keep <br />
  And these charmed guardian lips hold treasured still. <br />
  Virgin who comest perfected by joy, <br />
  Reveal the name thy sudden heart-beats learned. <br />
  Whom hast thou chosen, kingliest among men?&#8221; <br />
  And Savitri answered with her still calm voice <br />
  As one who speaks beneath the eyes of Fate: <br />
  &#8220;Father and king, I have carried out thy will. <br />
  One whom I sought I found in distant lands; <br />
  I have obeyed my heart, I have heard its call. <br />
  On the borders of a dreaming wilderness <br />
  Mid Shalwa&#8217;s giant hills and brooding woods <br />
  In his thatched hermitage Dyumatsena dwells, <br />
  Blind, exiled, outcast, once a mighty king. <br />
  The son of Dyumatsena, Satyavan, <br />
  I have met on the wild forest&#8217;s lonely verge. <br />
  My father, I have chosen. This is done.&#8221; <br />
  Astonished, all sat silent for a space. <br />
  Then Aswapati looked within and saw <br />
  A heavy shadow float above the name <br />
  Chased by a sudden and stupendous light; <br />
  He looked into his daughter&#8217;s eyes and spoke: <br />
  &#8220;Well hast thou done and I approve thy choice. <br />
  If this is all, then all is surely well; <br />
  If there is more, then all can still be well. <br />
  Whether it seem good or evil to men&#8217;s eyes, <br />
  Only for good the secret Will can work. <br />
  Our destiny is written in double terms: <br />
  Through Nature&#8217;s contraries we draw nearer God; <br />
  Out of the darkness we still grow to light. <br />
  Death is our road to immortality. <br />
  `Cry woe, cry woe,&#8217; the world&#8217;s lost voices wail,</p>

<p>Yet conquers the eternal Good at last.&#8221; <br />
  Then might the sage have spoken, but the king <br />
  In haste broke out and stayed the dangerous word: <br />
  &#8220;O singer of the ultimate ecstasy, <br />
  Lend not a dangerous vision to the blind <br />
  Because by native right thou hast seen clear. <br />
  Impose not on the mortal&#8217;s tremulous breast <br />
  The dire ordeal that foreknowledge brings; <br />
  Demand not now the Godhead in our acts. <br />
  Here are not happy peaks the heaven-nymphs roam <br />
  Or Coilas or Vaicountha&#8217;s starry stair: <br />
  Abrupt, jagged hills only the mighty climb <br />
  Are here where few dare even think to rise; <br />
  Far voices call down from the dizzy rocks, <br />
  Chill, slippery, precipitous are the paths. <br />
  Too hard the gods are with man&#8217;s fragile race; <br />
  In their large heavens they dwell exempt from Fate <br />
  And they forget the wounded feet of man, <br />
  His limbs that faint beneath the whips of grief, <br />
  His heart that hears the tread of time and death. <br />
  The future&#8217;s road is hid from mortal sight: <br />
  He moves towards a veiled and secret face. <br />
  To light one step in front is all his hope <br />
  And only for a little strength he asks <br />
  To meet the riddle of his shrouded fate. <br />
  Awaited by a vague and half-seen force, <br />
  Aware of danger to his uncertain hours <br />
  He guards his flickering yearnings from her breath; <br />
  He feels not when the dreadful fingers close <br />
  Around him with the grasp none can elude. <br />
  If thou canst loose her grip, then only speak. <br />
  Perhaps from the iron snare there is escape: <br />
  Our mind perhaps deceives us with its words <br />
  And gives the name of doom to our own choice; <br />
  Perhaps the blindness of our will is Fate.&#8221; <br />
  He said and Narad answered not the king.</p>

<p>But now the queen alarmed lifted her voice: <br />
  &#8220;O seer, thy bright arrival has been timed <br />
  To this high moment of a happy life; <br />
  Then let the speech benign of griefless spheres <br />
  Confirm this blithe conjunction of two stars <br />
  And sanction joy with thy celestial voice. <br />
  Here drag not in the peril of our thoughts, <br />
  Let not our words create the doom they fear. <br />
  Here is no cause for dread, no chance for grief <br />
  To raise her ominous head and stare at love. <br />

  Happy is Satyavan mid earthly men <br />
  Whom Savitri has chosen for her mate, <br />

  Then let thy blessing put the immortals&#8217; seal <br />
  On these bright lives&#8217; unstained felicity <br />
  Pushing the ominous Shadow from their days. <br />
  Too heavy falls a Shadow on man&#8217;s heart; <br />
  It dares not be too happy upon earth. <br />
  It dreads the blow dogging too vivid joys, <br />
  A lash unseen in Fate&#8217;s extended hand, <br />
  The danger lurking in fortune&#8217;s proud extremes, <br />
  An irony in life&#8217;s indulgent smile, <br />
  And trembles at the laughter of the gods. <br />
  Or if crouches unseen a panther doom, <br />
  If wings of Evil brood above that house, <br />
  Then also speak, that we may turn aside <br />
  And rescue our lives from hazard of wayside doom <br />
  And chance entanglement of an alien fate.&#8221; <br />
  And Narad slowly answered to the queen: <br />
  &#8220;What help is in prevision to the driven? <br />
  Safe doors cry opening near, the doomed pass on. <br />
  A future knowledge is an added pain, <br />
  A torturing burden and a fruitless light</p>

  The eternal poet, universal Mind, <br />
  Has paged each line of his imperial act; <br />
  Invisible the giant actors tread <br />
  And man lives like some secret player&#8217;s mask. <br />
  He knows not even what his lips shall speak. <br />
  For a mysterious Power compels his steps <br />
  And life is stronger than his trembling soul. <br />
  None can refuse what the stark Force demands: <br />
  Her eyes are fixed upon her mighty aim; <br />
  No cry or prayer can turn her from her path. <br />
  She has leaped an arrow from the bow of God.&#8221; <br />
  His words were theirs who live unforced to grieve <br />

  And the trouble and passion of the unquiet world. <br />
  As though her own bosom were pierced the mother saw <br />

  The stony-eyed injustice she accused <br />
  Of the marble godhead of inflexible Law, <br />
  Nor sought the strength extreme adversity brings <br />
  To lives that stand erect and front the World-Power: <br />
  Her heart appealed against the impartial judge, <br />
  Taxed with perversity the impersonal One. <br />
  Her tranquil spirit she called not to her aid, <br />
  But as a common man beneath his load <br />
  Grows faint and breathes his pain in ignorant words, <br />
  So now she arraigned the world&#8217;s impassive will:</p>

  Emerging from the dark forest&#8217;s sullen heart, <br />
  What evil thing stood smiling by the way <br />
  And wore the beauty of the Shalwa boy? <br />
  Perhaps he came an enemy from her past <br />
  Armed with a hidden force of ancient wrongs, <br />
  Himself unknowing, and seized her unknown. <br />

  Yet all in vain the bitter law was made. <br />
  Our own minds are the justicers of doom. <br />

  Smitten in the sorrow of scourged and helpless things, <br />
  Often it faints to meet other suffering eyes. <br />
  We are not as the gods who know not grief <br />
  And look impassive on a suffering world, <br />
  Calm they gaze down on the little human scene</p>

<p>And the short-lived passion crossing mortal hearts. <br />
  An ancient tale of woe can move us still, <br />
  We keep the ache of breasts that breathe no more, <br />
  We are shaken by the sight of human pain, <br />
  And share the miseries that others feel. <br />
  Ours not the passionless lids that cannot age. <br />
  Too hard for us is heaven&#8217;s indifference: <br />
  Our own tragedies are not enough for us, <br />
  All pathos and all sufferings we make ours; <br />
  We have sorrow for a greatness passed away <br />
  And feel the touch of tears in mortal things. <br />
  Even a stranger&#8217;s anguish rends my heart, <br />
  And this, O Narad, is my well-loved child. <br />
  Hide not from us our doom, if doom is ours. <br />
  This is the worst, an unknown face of Fate, <br />
  A terror ominous, mute, felt more than seen <br />
  Behind our seat by day, our couch by night, <br />
  A Fate lurking in the shadow of our hearts, <br />
  The anguish of the unseen that waits to strike. <br />
  To know is best, however hard to bear.&#8221; <br />
  Then cried the sage piercing the mother&#8217;s heart, <br />
  Forcing to steel the will of Savitri, <br />
  His words set free the spring of cosmic Fate. <br />
  The great Gods use the pain of human hearts <br />
  As a sharp axe to hew their cosmic road: <br />
  They squander lavishly men&#8217;s blood and tears <br />
  For a moment&#8217;s purpose in their fateful work. <br />
  This cosmic Nature&#8217;s balance is not ours <br />
  Nor the mystic measure of her need and use. <br />
  A single word lets loose vast agencies; <br />
  A casual act determines the world&#8217;s fate. <br />
  So now he set free destiny in that hour. <br />
  &#8220;The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth. <br />
  A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens <br />
  Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men, <br />
  His figure is the front of Nature&#8217;s march,</p>

<p>His single being excels the works of Time. <br />
  A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven, <br />
  Delightful is the soul of Satyavan, <br />
  A ray out of the rapturous Infinite, <br />
  A silence waking to a hymn of joy. <br />
  A divinity and kingliness gird his brow; <br />
  His eyes keep a memory from a world of bliss. <br />
  As brilliant as a lonely moon in heaven, <br />
  Gentle like the sweet bud that spring desires, <br />
  Pure like a stream that kisses silent banks, <br />
  He takes with bright surprise spirit and sense. <br />
  A living knot of golden Paradise, <br />
  A blue Immense he leans to the longing world, <br />
  Time&#8217;s joy borrowed out of eternity, <br />
  A star of splendour or a rose of bliss. <br />
  In him soul and Nature, equal Presences, <br />
  Balance and fuse in a wide harmony. <br />
  The Happy in their bright ether have not hearts <br />
  More sweet and true than this of mortal make <br />
  That takes all joy as the world&#8217;s native gift <br />
  And to all gives joy as the world&#8217;s natural right. <br />
  His speech carries a light of inner truth, <br />
  And a large-eyed communion with the Power <br />
  In common things has made veilless his mind, <br />
  A seer in earth-shapes of garbless deity. <br />
  A tranquil breadth of sky windless and still <br />
  Watching the world like a mind of unplumbed thought, <br />
  A silent space musing and luminous <br />
  Uncovered by the morning to delight, <br />
  A green tangle of trees upon a happy hill <br />
  Made into a murmuring nest by southern winds, <br />
  These are his images and parallels, <br />
  His kin in beauty and in depth his peers. <br />
  A will to climb lifts a delight to live, <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s height companion of earth-beauty&#8217;s charm, <br />
  An aspiration to the immortals&#8217; air</p>

<p>Lain on the lap of mortal ecstasy. <br />
  His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts <br />
  To live with his own in a glad tenancy, <br />
  His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven, <br />
  A godhead quarried from the stones of life. <br />
  O loss, if death into its elements <br />
  Of which his gracious envelope was built, <br />
  Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets, <br />
  As if earth could not keep too long from heaven <br />
  A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods, <br />
  A being so rare, of so divine a make! <br />
  In one brief year when this bright hour flies back <br />
  And perches careless on a branch of Time, <br />
  This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth, <br />
  This splendour vanishes from the mortal&#8217;s sky: <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s greatness came, but was too great to stay. <br />
  Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her; <br />
  This day returning Satyavan must die.&#8221; <br />
  A lightning bright and nude the sentence fell. <br />
  But the queen cried: &#8220;Vain then can be heaven&#8217;s grace! <br />
  Heaven mocks us with the brilliance of its gifts, <br />
  For Death is a cupbearer of the wine <br />
  Of too brief joy held up to mortal lips <br />
  For a passionate moment by the careless gods. <br />
  But I reject the grace and the mockery. <br />
  Mounting thy car go forth, O Savitri, <br />
  And travel once more through the peopled lands. <br />
  Alas, in the green gladness of the woods <br />
  Thy heart has stooped to a misleading call. <br />
  Choose once again and leave this fated head, <br />
  Death is the gardener of this wonder-tree; <br />
  Love&#8217;s sweetness sleeps in his pale marble hand. <br />
  Advancing in a honeyed line but closed, <br />
  A little joy would buy too bitter an end. <br />
  Plead not thy choice, for death has made it vain. <br />
  Thy youth and radiance were not born to lie</p>

<p>A casket void dropped on a careless soil; <br />
  A choice less rare may call a happier fate.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri answered from her violent heart,&#8211; <br />
  Her voice was calm, her face was fixed like steel: <br />
  &#8220;Once my heart chose and chooses not again. <br />
  The word I have spoken can never be erased, <br />
  It is written in the record book of God. <br />
  The truth once uttered, from the earth&#8217;s air effaced, <br />
  By mind forgotten, sounds immortally <br />
  For ever in the memory of Time. <br />
  Once the dice fall thrown by the hand of Fate <br />
  In an eternal moment of the gods. <br />
  My heart has sealed its troth to Satyavan: <br />
  Its signature adverse Fate cannot efface, <br />
  Its seal not Fate nor Death nor Time dissolve. <br />
  Those who shall part who have grown one being within? <br />
  Death&#8217;s grip can break our bodies, not our souls; <br />
  If death take him, I too know how to die. <br />
  Let Fate do with me what she will or can; <br />
  I am stronger than death and greater than my fate; <br />
  My love shall outlast the world, doom falls from me <br />
  Helpless against my immortality. <br />
  Fate&#8217;s law may change, but not my spirit&#8217;s will.&#8221; <br />
  An adamant will, she cast her speech like bronze. <br />
  But in the queen&#8217;s mind listening her words <br />
  Rang like the voice of a self-chosen Doom <br />
  Denying every issue of escape. <br />
  To her own despair answer the mother made; <br />
  As one she cried who in her heavy heart <br />
  Labours amid the sobbing of her hopes <br />
  To wake a note of help from sadder strings: <br />
  &#8220;O child, in the magnificence of thy soul <br />
  Dwelling on the border of a greater world <br />
  And dazzled by thy superhuman thoughts, <br />
  Thou lendst eternity to a mortal hope. <br />
  Here on this mutable and ignorant earth</p>

<p>Who is the lover and who is the friend? <br />
  All passes here, nothing remains the same. <br />
  None is for any on this transient globe. <br />
  He whom thou lovest now, a stranger came <br />
  And into a far strangeness shall depart: <br />
  His moment&#8217;s part once done upon life&#8217;s stage <br />
  Which for a time was given him from within, <br />
  To other scenes he moves and other players <br />
  And laughs and weeps mid faces new, unknown. <br />
  The body thou hast loved is cast away <br />
  Amidst the brute unchanging stuff of worlds <br />
  To indifferent mighty Nature and becomes <br />
  Crude matter for the joy of others&#8217; lives. <br />
  But for our souls, upon the wheel of God <br />
  For ever turning, they arrive and go, <br />
  Married and sundered in the magic round <br />
  Of the great Dancer of the boundless dance. <br />
  Our emotions are but high and dying notes <br />
  Of his wild music changed compellingly <br />
  By the passionate movements of a seeking Heart <br />
  In the inconstant links of hour with hour. <br />
  To call down heaven&#8217;s distant answering song, <br />
  To cry to an unseized bliss is all we dare; <br />
  Once seized, we lose the heavenly music&#8217;s sense; <br />
  Too near, the rhythmic cry has fled or failed; <br />
  All sweetnesses are baffling symbols here. <br />
  Love dies before the lover in our breast: <br />
  Our joys are perfumes in a brittle vase. <br />
  O then what wreck is this upon Time&#8217;s sea <br />
  To spread life&#8217;s sails to the hurricane desire <br />
  And call for pilot the unseeing heart! <br />
  O child, wilt thou proclaim, wilt thou then follow <br />
  Against the Law that is the eternal will <br />
  The autarchy of the rash Titan&#8217;s mood <br />
  To whom his own fierce will is the one law <br />
  In a world where Truth is not, nor Light nor God?</p>

<p>Only the gods can speak what now thou speakst. <br />
  Thou who art human, think not like a god. <br />
  For man, below the god, above the brute, <br />
  Is given the calm reason as his guide; <br />
  He is not driven by an unthinking will <br />
  As are the actions of the bird and beast; <br />
  He is not moved by stark Necessity <br />
  Like the senseless motion of inconscient things. <br />
  The giant&#8217;s and the Titan&#8217;s furious march <br />
  Climbs to usurp the kingdom of the gods <br />
  Or skirts the demon magnitudes of Hell; <br />
  In the unreflecting passion of their hearts <br />
  They dash their lives against the eternal Law <br />
  And fall and break by their own violent mass: <br />
  The middle path is made for thinking man. <br />
  To choose his steps by reason&#8217;s vigilant light, <br />
  To choose his path among the many paths <br />
  Is given him, for each his difficult goal <br />
  Hewn out of infinite possibility. <br />
  Leave not thy goal to follow a beautiful face. <br />
  Only when thou hast climbed above thy mind <br />
  And liv&#8217;st in the calm vastness of the One <br />
  Can love be eternal in the eternal Bliss <br />
  And love divine replace the human tie. <br />
  There is a shrouded law, an austere force: <br />
  It bids thee strengthen thy undying spirit; <br />
  It offers its severe benignancies <br />
  Of work and thought and measured grave delight <br />
  As steps to climb to God&#8217;s far secret heights. <br />
  Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage, <br />
  Each year a mile upon the heavenly Way, <br />
  Each dawn opens into a larger Light. <br />
  Thy acts are thy helpers, all events are signs, <br />
  Waking and sleep are opportunities <br />
  Given to thee by an immortal Power. <br />
  So canst thou raise thy pure unvanquished spirit,</p>

<p>Till spread to heaven in a wide vesper calm, <br />
  Indifferent and gentle as the sky, <br />
  It greatens slowly into timeless peace.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied with steadfast eyes: <br />
  &#8220;My will is part of the eternal Will, <br />
  My fate is what my spirit&#8217;s strength can make, <br />
  My fate is what my spirit&#8217;s strength can bear; <br />
  My strength is not the Titan&#8217;s; it is God&#8217;s. <br />
  I have discovered my glad reality <br />
  Beyond my body in another&#8217;s being: <br />
  I have found the deep unchanging soul of love. <br />
  Then how shall I desire a lonely good, <br />
  Or slay, aspiring to white vacant peace, <br />
  The endless hope that made my soul spring forth <br />
  Out of its infinite solitude and sleep? <br />
  My spirit has glimpsed the glory for which it came, <br />
  The beating of one vast heart in the flame of things, <br />
  My eternity clasped by his eternity <br />
  And, tireless of the sweet abysms of Time, <br />
  Deep possibility always to love. <br />
  This, this is first, last joy and to its throb <br />
  The riches of a thousand fortunate years <br />
  Are poverty. Nothing to me are death and grief <br />
  Or ordinary lives and happy days. <br />
  And what to me are common souls of men <br />
  Or eyes and lips that are not Satyavan&#8217;s? <br />
  I have no need to draw back from his arms <br />
  And the discovered paradise of his love <br />
  And journey into a still infinity. <br />
  Only now for my soul in Satyavan <br />
  I treasure the rich occasion of my birth: <br />
  In sunlight and a dream of emerald ways <br />
  I shall walk with him like gods in Paradise. <br />
  If for a year, that year is all my life. <br />
  And yet I know this is not all my fate <br />
  Only to live and love awhile and die.</p>
