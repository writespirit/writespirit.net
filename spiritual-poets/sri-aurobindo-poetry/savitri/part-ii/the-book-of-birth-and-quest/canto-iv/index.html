<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">The world-ways opened before Savitri. <br />
  At first a strangeness of new brilliant scenes <br />
  Peopled her mind and kept her body&#8217;s gaze. <br />
  But as she moved across the changing earth <br />
  A deeper consciousness welled up in her: <br />
  A citizen of many scenes and climes, <br />
  Each soil and country it had made its home; <br />
  It took all clans and peoples for her own, <br />
  Till the whole destiny of mankind was hers. <br />
  These unfamiliar spaces on her way <br />
  Were known and neighbours to a sense within, <br />
  Landscapes recurred like lost forgotten fields, <br />
  Cities and rivers and plains her vision claimed <br />
  Like slow-recurring memories in front, <br />
  The stars at night were her past&#8217;s brilliant friends, <br />
  The winds murmured to her of ancient things <br />
  And she met nameless comrades loved by her once. <br />
  All was a part of old forgotten selves: <br />
  Vaguely or with a flash of sudden hints <br />
  Her acts recalled a line of bygone power, <br />
  Even her motion&#8217;s purpose was not new: <br />
  Traveller to a prefigured high event, <br />
  She seemed to her remembering witness soul <br />
  To trace again a journey often made. <br />
  A guidance turned the dumb revolving wheels <br />
  And in the eager body of their speed <br />
  The dim-masked hooded godheads rode who move <br />
  Assigned to man immutably from his birth, <br />
  Receivers of the inner and outer law, <br />
  At once the agents of his spirit&#8217;s will <br />
  And witnesses and executors of his fate.</td>

<p>Inexorably faithful to their task, <br />
  They hold his nature&#8217;s sequence in their guard <br />
  Carrying the unbroken thread old lives have spun. <br />
  Attendants on his destiny&#8217;s measured walk <br />
  Leading to joys he has won and pains he has called, <br />
  Even in his casual steps they intervene. <br />
  Nothing we think or do is void or vain; <br />
  Each is an energy loosed and holds its course. <br />
  The shadowy keepers of our deathless past <br />
  Have made our fate the child of our own acts, <br />
  And from the furrows laboured by our will <br />
  We reap the fruit of our forgotten deeds. <br />
  But since unseen the tree that bore this fruit <br />
  And we live in a present born from an unknown past, <br />
  They seem but parts of a mechanic Force <br />
  To a mechanic mind tied by earth&#8217;s laws; <br />
  Yet are they instruments of a Will supreme, <br />
  Watched by a still all-seeing Eye above. <br />
  A prescient architect of Fate and Chance <br />
  Who builds our lives on a foreseen design <br />
  The meaning knows and consequence of each step <br />
  And watches the inferior stumbling powers. <br />
  Upon her silent heights she was aware <br />
  Of a calm Presence throned above her brows <br />
  Who saw the goal and chose each fateful curve; <br />
  It used the body for its pedestal; <br />
  The eyes that wandered were its searchlight fires, <br />
  The hands that held the reins its living tools; <br />
  All was the working of an ancient plan, <br />
  A way proposed by an unerring Guide. <br />
  Across wide noons and glowing afternoons, <br />
  She met with Nature and with human forms <br />
  And listened to the voices of the world; <br />
  Driven from within she followed her long road, <br />
  Mute in the luminous cavern of her heart, <br />
  Like a bright cloud through the resplendent day.</p>

<p>At first her path ran far through peopled tracts: <br />
  Admitted to the lion eye of States <br />
  And theatres of the loud act of man, <br />
  Her carven chariot with its fretted wheels <br />
  Threaded through clamorous marts and sentinel towers <br />
  Past figured gates and high dream-sculptured fronts <br />
  And gardens hung in the sapphire of the skies, <br />
  Pillared assembly halls with armoured guards, <br />
  Small fanes where one calm Image watched man&#8217;s life <br />
  And temples hewn as if by exiled gods <br />
  To imitate their lost eternity. <br />
  Often from gilded dusk to argent dawn, <br />
  Where jewel-lamps flickered on frescoed walls <br />
  And the stone lattice stared at moonlit boughs, <br />
  Half-conscious of the tardy listening night <br />
  Dimly she glided between banks of sleep <br />
  At rest in the slumbering palaces of kings. <br />
  Hamlet and village saw the fate-wain pass, <br />
  Homes of a life bent to the soil it ploughs <br />
  For sustenance of its short and passing days <br />
  That, transient, keep their old repeated course, <br />
  Unchanging in the circle of a sky <br />
  Which alters not above our mortal toil. <br />
  Away from this thinking creature&#8217;s burdened hours <br />
  To free and griefless spaces now she turned <br />
  Not yet perturbed by human joys and fears. <br />
  Here was the childhood of primaeval earth, <br />
  Here timeless musings large and glad and still, <br />
  Men had forborne as yet to fill with cares, <br />
  Imperial acres of the eternal sower <br />
  And wind-stirred grass-lands winking in the sun: <br />
  Or mid green musing of woods and rough-browed hills, <br />
  In the grove&#8217;s murmurous bee-air humming wild <br />
  Or past the long lapsing voice of silver floods <br />
  Like a swift hope journeying among its dreams <br />
  Hastened the chariot of the golden bride.</p>

<p>Out of the world&#8217;s immense unhuman past <br />
  Tract-memories and ageless remnants came, <br />
  Domains of light enfeoffed to antique calm <br />
  Listened to the unaccustomed sound of hooves <br />
  And large immune entangled silences <br />
  Absorbed her into emerald secrecy <br />
  And slow hushed wizard nets of fiery bloom <br />
  Environed with their coloured snare her wheels. <br />
  The strong importunate feet of Time fell soft <br />
  Along these lonely ways, his titan pace <br />
  Forgotten and his stark and ruinous rounds. <br />
  The inner ear that listens to solitude, <br />
  Leaning self-rapt unboundedly could hear <br />
  The rhythm of the intenser wordless Thought <br />
  That gathers in the silence behind life, <br />
  And the low sweet inarticulate voice of earth <br />
  In the great passion of her sun-kissed trance <br />
  Ascended with its yearning undertone. <br />
  Afar from the brute noise of clamorous needs <br />
  The quieted all-seeking mind could feel, <br />
  At rest from its blind outwardness of will, <br />
  The unwearied clasp of her mute patient love <br />
  And know for a soul the mother of our forms. <br />
  This spirit stumbling in the fields of sense, <br />
  This creature bruised in the mortar of the days <br />
  Could find in her broad spaces of release. <br />
  Not yet was a world all occupied by care. <br />
  The bosom of our mother kept for us still <br />
  Her austere regions and her musing depths, <br />
  Her impersonal reaches lonely and inspired <br />
  And the mightinesses of her rapture haunts. <br />
  Muse-lipped she nursed her symbol mysteries <br />
  And guarded for her pure-eyed sacraments <br />
  The valley clefts between her breasts of joy, <br />
  Her mountain altars for the fires of dawn <br />
  And nuptial beaches where the ocean couched</p>

<p>And the huge chanting of her prophet woods. <br />
  Fields had she of her solitary mirth, <br />
  Plains hushed and happy in the embrace of light, <br />
  Alone with the cry of birds and hue of flowers, <br />
  And wildernesses of wonder lit by her moons <br />
  And grey seer-evenings kindling with the stars <br />
  And dim movement in the night&#8217;s infinitude. <br />
  August, exulting in her Maker&#8217;s eye, <br />
  She felt her nearness to him in earth&#8217;s breast, <br />
  Conversed still with a Light behind the veil, <br />
  Still communed with Eternity beyond. <br />
  A few and fit inhabitants she called <br />
  To share the glad communion of her peace; <br />
  The breadth, the summit were their natural home. <br />
  The strong king-sages from their labour done, <br />
  Freed from the warrior tension of their task, <br />
  Came to her serene sessions in these wilds; <br />
  The strife was over, the respite lay in front. <br />
  Happy they lived with birds and beasts and flowers <br />
  And sunlight and the rustle of the leaves, <br />
  And heard the wild winds wandering in the night, <br />
  Mused with the stars in their mute constant ranks, <br />
  And lodged in the mornings as in azure tents, <br />
  And with the glory of the noons were one. <br />
  Some deeper plunged; from life&#8217;s external clasp <br />
  Beckoned into a fiery privacy <br />
  In the soul&#8217;s unprofaned star-white recess <br />
  They sojourned with an everliving Bliss; <br />
  A Voice profound in the ecstasy and the hush <br />
  They heard, beheld an all-revealing Light. <br />
  All time-made difference they overcame; <br />
  The world was fibred with their own heart-strings; <br />
  Close drawn to the heart that beats in every breast, <br />
  They reached the one self in all through boundless love. <br />
  Attuned to Silence and to the world-rhyme, <br />
  They loosened the knot of the imprisoning mind;</p>

<p>Achieved was the wide untroubled witness gaze, <br />
  Unsealed was Nature&#8217;s great spiritual eye; <br />
  To the height of heights rose now their daily climb: <br />
  Truth leaned to them from her supernal realm; <br />
  Above them blazed eternity&#8217;s mystic suns. <br />
  Nameless the austere ascetics without home <br />
  Abandoning speech and motion and desire <br />
  Aloof from creatures sat absorbed, alone, <br />
  Immaculate in tranquil heights of self <br />
  On concentration&#8217;s luminous voiceless peaks, <br />
  World-naked hermits with their matted hair <br />
  Immobile as the passionless great hills <br />
  Around them grouped like thoughts of some vast mood <br />
  Awaiting the Infinite&#8217;s behest to end. <br />
  The seers attuned to the universal Will, <br />
  Content in Him who smiles behind earth&#8217;s forms, <br />
  Abode ungrieved by the insistent days. <br />
  About them like green trees girdling a hill <br />
  Young grave disciples fashioned by their touch, <br />
  Trained to the simple act and conscious word, <br />
  Greatened within and grew to meet their heights. <br />
  Far-wandering seekers on the Eternal&#8217;s path <br />
  Brought to these quiet founts their spirit&#8217;s thirst <br />
  And spent the treasure of a silent hour <br />
  Bathed in the purity of the mild gaze <br />
  That, uninsistent, ruled them from its peace, <br />
  And by its influence found the ways of calm. <br />
  The Infants of the monarchy of the worlds, <br />
  The heroic leaders of a coming time, <br />
  King-children nurtured in that spacious air <br />
  Like lions gambolling in sky and sun <br />
  Received half-consciously their godlike stamp: <br />
  Formed in the type of the high thoughts they sang <br />
  They learned the wide magnificence of mood <br />
  That makes us comrades of the cosmic urge, <br />
  No longer chained to their small separate selves,</p>

<p>Plastic and firm beneath the eternal hand, <br />
  Met Nature with a bold and friendly clasp <br />
  And served in her the Power that shapes her works. <br />
  One-souled to all and free from narrowing bonds, <br />
  Large like a continent of warm sunshine <br />
  In wide equality&#8217;s impartial joy, <br />
  These sages breathed for God&#8217;s delight in things. <br />
  Assisting the slow entries of the gods, <br />
  Sowing in young minds immortal thoughts they lived, <br />
  Taught the great Truth to which man&#8217;s race must rise <br />
  Or opened the gates of freedom to a few. <br />
  Imparting to our struggling world the Light <br />
  They breathed like spirits from Time&#8217;s dull yoke released, <br />
  Comrades and vessels of the cosmic Force, <br />
  Using a natural mastery like the sun&#8217;s: <br />
  Their speech, their silence was a help to earth. <br />
  A magic happiness flowed from their touch; <br />
  Oneness was sovereign in that sylvan peace, <br />
  The wild beast joined in friendship with its prey; <br />
  Persuading the hatred and the strife to cease <br />
  The love that flows from the one Mother&#8217;s breast <br />
  Healed with their hearts the hard and wounded world. <br />
  Others escaped from the confines of thought <br />
  To where Mind motionless sleeps waiting Light&#8217;s birth, <br />
  And came back quivering with a nameless Force, <br />
  Drunk with a wine of lightning in their cells; <br />
  Intuitive knowledge leaping into speech, <br />
  Seized, vibrant, kindling with the inspired word, <br />
  Hearing the subtle voice that clothes the heavens, <br />
  Carrying the splendour that has lit the suns, <br />
  They sang Infinity&#8217;s names and deathless powers <br />
  In metres that reflect the moving worlds, <br />
  Sight&#8217;s sound-waves breaking from the soul&#8217;s great deeps. <br />
  Some lost to the person and his strip of thought <br />
  In a motionless ocean of impersonal Power, <br />
  Sat mighty, visioned with the Infinite&#8217;s light,</p>

  Surveyed the plan of past and future Time. <br />
  Some winged like birds out of the cosmic sea <br />
  And vanished into a bright and featureless Vast: <br />
  Some silent watched the universal dance, <br />
  Or helped the world by world-indifference. <br />
  Some watched no more merged in a lonely Self, <br />
  Absorbed in the trance from which no soul returns, <br />
  All the occult world-lines for ever closed, <br />
  The chains of birth and person cast away: <br />
  Some uncompanioned reached the Ineffable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As floats a sunbeam through a shady place, <br />
  The golden virgin in her carven car <br />
  Came gliding among meditation&#8217;s seats. <br />
  Often in twilight mid returning troops <br />
  Of cattle thickening with their dust the shades <br />
  When the loud day had slipped below the verge, <br />
  Arriving in a peaceful hermit grove <br />
  She rested drawing round her like a cloak <br />
  Its spirit of patient muse and potent prayer. <br />
  Or near to a lion river&#8217;s tawny mane <br />
  And trees that worshipped on a praying shore, <br />
  A domed and templed air&#8217;s serene repose <br />
  Beckoned to her hurrying wheels to stay their speed. <br />
  In the solemnity of a space that seemed <br />
  A mind remembering ancient silences, <br />
  Where to the heart great bygone voices called <br />
  And the large liberty of brooding seers <br />
  Had left the long impress of their soul&#8217;s scene, <br />
  Awake in candid dawn or darkness mooned, <br />
  To the still touch inclined the daughter of Flame <br />
  Drank in hushed splendour between tranquil lids <br />
  And felt the kinship of eternal calm. <br />
  But morn broke in reminding her of her quest <br />
  And from low rustic couch or mat she rose</p>

<p>And went impelled on her unfinished way <br />
  And followed the fateful orbit of her life <br />
  Like a desire that questions silent gods <br />
  Then passes starlike to some bright Beyond. <br />
  Thence to great solitary tracts she came, <br />
  Where man was a passer-by towards human scenes <br />
  Or sole in Nature&#8217;s vastness strove to live <br />
  And called for help to ensouled invisible Powers, <br />
  Overwhelmed by the immensity of his world <br />
  And unaware of his own infinity. <br />
  The earth multiplied to her a changing brow <br />
  And called her with a far and nameless voice. <br />
  The mountains in their anchorite solitude, <br />
  The forests with their multitudinous chant <br />
  Disclosed to her the masked divinity&#8217;s doors. <br />
  On dreaming plains, an indolent expanse, <br />
  The death-bed of a pale enchanted eve <br />
  Under the glamour of a sunken sky, <br />
  Impassive she lay as at an age&#8217;s end, <br />
  Or crossed an eager pack of huddled hills <br />
  Lifting their heads to hunt a lairlike sky, <br />
  Or travelled in a strange and empty land <br />
  Where desolate summits camped in a weird heaven, <br />
  Mute sentinels beneath a drifting moon, <br />
  Or wandered in some lone tremendous wood <br />
  Ringing for ever with the crickets&#8217; cry <br />
  Or followed a long glistening serpent road <br />
  Through fields and pastures lapped in moveless light <br />
  Or reached the wild beauty of a desert space <br />
  Where never plough was driven nor herd had grazed <br />
  And slumbered upon stripped and thirsty sands <br />
  Amid the savage wild-beast night&#8217;s appeal. <br />
  Still unaccomplished was the fateful quest; <br />
  Still she found not the one predestined face <br />
  For which she sought amid the sons of men. <br />
  A grandiose silence wrapped the regal day:</p>
