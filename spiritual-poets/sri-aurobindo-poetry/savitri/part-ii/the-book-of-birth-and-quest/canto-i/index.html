  </td>
<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A Maenad of the cycles of desire <br />
  Around a Light she must not dare to touch, <br />
  Hastening towards a far-off unknown goal <br />
  Earth followed the endless journey of the Sun. <br />
  A mind but half-awake in the swing of the void <br />
  On the bosom of Inconscience dreamed out life <br />
  And bore this finite world of thought and deed <br />
  Across the immobile trance of the Infinite. <br />
  A vast immutable silence with her ran: <br />
  Prisoner of speed upon a jewelled wheel, <br />
  She communed with the mystic heart in Space. <br />
  Amid the ambiguous stillness of the stars <br />
  She moved towards some undisclosed event <br />
  And her rhythm measured the long whirl of Time. <br />
  In ceaseless motion round the purple rim <br />
  Day after day sped by like coloured spokes, <br />
  And through a glamour of shifting hues of air <br />
  The seasons drew in linked significant dance <br />
  The symbol pageant of the changing year. <br />
  Across the burning languor of the soil <br />
  Paced Summer with his pomp of violent noons <br />
  And stamped his tyranny of torrid light <br />
  And the blue seal of a great burnished sky. <br />
  Next through its fiery swoon or clotted knot <br />
  Rain-tide burst in upon torn wings of heat, <br />
  Startled with lightnings air&#8217;s unquiet drowse, <br />
  Lashed with life-giving streams the torpid soil, <br />
  Overcast with flare and sound and storm-winged dark <br />
  The star-defended doors of heaven&#8217;s dim sleep, <br />
  Or from the gold eye of her paramour <br />
  Covered with packed cloud-veils the earth&#8217;s brown face.</td>

<p>Armies of revolution crossed the time-field, <br />
  The clouds&#8217; unending march besieged the world, <br />
  Tempests&#8217; pronunciamentos claimed the sky <br />
  And thunder drums announced the embattled gods. <br />
  A traveller from unquiet neighbouring seas, <br />
  The dense-maned monsoon rode neighing through earth&#8217;s hours: <br />
  Thick now the emissary javelins: <br />
  Enormous lightnings split the horizon&#8217;s rim <br />
  And, hurled from the quarters as from contending camps, <br />
  Married heaven&#8217;s edges steep and bare and blind: <br />
  A surge and hiss and onset of huge rain, <br />
  The long straight sleet-drift, clamours of winged storm-charge, <br />
  Throngs of wind-faces, rushing of wind-feet <br />
  Hurrying swept through the prone afflicted plains: <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s waters trailed and dribbled through the drowned land. <br />
  Then all was a swift stride, a sibilant race, <br />
  Or all was tempest&#8217;s shout and water&#8217;s fall. <br />
  A dimness sagged on the grey floor of day, <br />
  Its dingy sprawling length joined morn to eve, <br />
  Wallowing in sludge and shower it reached black dark. <br />
  Day a half darkness wore as its dull dress. <br />
  Light looked into dawn&#8217;s tarnished glass and met <br />
  Its own face there, twin to a half-lit night&#8217;s: <br />
  Downpour and drip and seeping mist swayed all <br />
  And turned dry soil to bog and reeking mud: <br />
  Earth was a quagmire, heaven a dismal block. <br />
  None saw through dank drenched weeks the dungeon sun. <br />
  Even when no turmoil vexed air&#8217;s sombre rest, <br />
  Or a faint ray glimmered through weeping clouds <br />
  As a sad smile gleams veiled by returning tears, <br />
  All promised brightness failed at once denied <br />
  Or, soon condemned, died like a brief-lived hope. <br />
  Then a last massive deluge thrashed dead mire <br />
  And a subsiding mutter left all still, <br />
  Or only the muddy creep of sinking floods <br />
  Or only a whisper and green toss of trees.</p>

<p>Earth&#8217;s mood now changed; she lay in lulled repose, <br />
  The hours went by with slow contented tread: <br />
  A wide and tranquil air remembered peace, <br />
  Earth was the comrade of a happy sun. <br />
  A calmness neared as of the approach of God, <br />
  A light of musing trance lit soil and sky <br />
  And an identity and ecstasy <br />
  Filled meditation&#8217;s solitary heart. <br />
  A dream loitered in the dumb mind of Space, <br />
  Time opened its chambers of felicity, <br />
  An exaltation entered and a hope: <br />
  An inmost self looked up to a heavenlier height, <br />
  An inmost thought kindled a hidden flame <br />
  And the inner sight adored an unseen sun. <br />
  Three thoughtful seasons passed with shining tread <br />
  And scanning one by one the pregnant hours <br />
  Watched for a flame that lurked in luminous depths, <br />
  The vigil of some mighty birth to come. <br />
  Autumn led in the glory of her moons <br />
  And dreamed in the splendour of her lotus pools <br />
  And Winter and Dew-time laid their calm cool hands <br />
  On Nature&#8217;s bosom still in a half sleep <br />
  And deepened with hues of lax and mellow ease <br />
  The tranquil beauty of the waning year. <br />
  Then Spring, an ardent lover, leaped through leaves <br />
  And caught the earth-bride in his eager clasp; <br />
  His advent was a fire of irised hues, <br />
  His arms were a circle of the arrival of joy. <br />
  His voice was a call to the Transcendent&#8217;s sphere <br />
  Whose secret touch upon our mortal lives <br />
  Keeps ever new the thrill that made the world, <br />
  Remoulds an ancient sweetness to new shapes <br />
  And guards intact unchanged by death and Time <br />
  The answer of our hearts to Nature&#8217;s charm <br />
  And keeps for ever new, yet still the same, <br />
  The throb that ever wakes to the old delight</p>

<p>And beauty and rapture and the joy to live. <br />
  His coming brought the magic and the spell; <br />
  At his touch life&#8217;s tired heart grew glad and young; <br />
  He made joy a willing prisoner in her breast. <br />
  His grasp was a young god&#8217;s upon earth&#8217;s limbs: <br />

  Impatient for felicity he came, <br />
  High-fluting with the co&atilde;l&#8217;s happy voice, <br />
  His peacock turban trailing on the trees; <br />
  His breath was a warm summons to delight, <br />
  The dense voluptuous azure was his gaze. <br />
  A soft celestial urge surprised the blood <br />
  Rich with the instinct of God&#8217;s sensuous joys; <br />
  Revealed in beauty, a cadence was abroad <br />
  Insistent on the rapture-thrill in life: <br />
  Immortal movements touched the fleeting hours. <br />
  A godlike packed intensity of sense <br />
  Made it a passionate pleasure even to breathe; <br />
  All sights and voices wove a single charm. <br />
  The life of the enchanted globe became <br />
  A storm of sweetness and of light and song, <br />
  A revel of colour and of ecstasy, <br />
  A hymn of rays, a litany of cries: <br />
  A strain of choral priestly music sang <br />
  And, swung on the swaying censer of the trees, <br />
  A sacrifice of perfume filled the hours. <br />
  Asocas burned in crimson spots of flame, <br />
  Pure like the breath of an unstained desire <br />
  White jasmines haunted the enamoured air, <br />
  Pale mango-blossoms fed the liquid voice <br />
  Of the love-maddened co&atilde;l, and the brown bee <br />
  Muttered in fragrance mid the honey-buds. <br />
  The sunlight was a great god&#8217;s golden smile. <br />
  All Nature was at beauty&#8217;s festival.</p>

<p>&nbsp; In this high signal moment of the gods <br />
  Answering earth&#8217;s yearning and her cry for bliss, <br />
  A greatness from our other countries came. <br />
  A silence in the noise of earthly things <br />
  Immutably revealed the secret Word, <br />
  A mightier influx filled the oblivious clay: <br />
  A lamp was lit, a sacred image made. <br />
  A mediating ray had touched the earth <br />
  Bridging the gulf between man&#8217;s mind and God&#8217;s; <br />
  Its brightness linked our transience to the Unknown. <br />
  A spirit of its celestial source aware <br />
  Translating heaven into a human shape <br />
  Descended into earth&#8217;s imperfect mould <br />
  And wept not fallen to mortality, <br />
  But looked on all with large and tranquil eyes. <br />
  One had returned from the transcendent planes <br />
  And bore anew the load of mortal breath, <br />
  Who had striven of old with our darkness and our pain; <br />
  She took again her divine unfinished task: <br />
  Survivor of death and the aeonic years, <br />
  Once more with her fathomless heart she fronted Time. <br />
  Again there was renewed, again revealed <br />
  The ancient closeness by earth-vision veiled, <br />
  The secret contact broken off in Time, <br />
  A consanguinity of earth and heaven, <br />
  Between the human portion toiling here <br />
  And an as yet unborn and limitless Force. <br />
  Again the mystic deep attempt began, <br />
  The daring wager of the cosmic game. <br />
  For since upon this blind and whirling globe <br />
  Earth-plasm first quivered with the illumining mind <br />
  And life invaded the material sheath <br />
  Afflicting Inconscience with the need to feel, <br />
  Since in Infinity&#8217;s silence woke a word, <br />
  A Mother-wisdom works in Nature&#8217;s breast <br />
  To pour delight on the heart of toil and want</p>

<p>And press perfection on life&#8217;s stumbling powers, <br />
  Impose heaven-sentience on the obscure abyss <br />
  And make dumb Matter conscious of its God. <br />
  Although our fallen minds forget to climb, <br />
  Although our human stuff resists or breaks, <br />
  She keeps her will that hopes to divinise clay; <br />
  Failure cannot repress, defeat o&#8217;erthrow; <br />
  Time cannot weary her nor the Void subdue, <br />
  The ages have not made her passion less; <br />
  No victory she admits of Death or Fate. <br />
  Always she drives the soul to new attempt; <br />
  Always her magical infinitude <br />
  Forces to aspire the inert brute elements; <br />
  As one who has all infinity to waste, <br />
  She scatters the seed of the Eternal&#8217;s strength <br />
  On a half-animate and crumbling mould, <br />
  Plants heaven&#8217;s delight in the heart&#8217;s passionate mire, <br />
  Pours godhead&#8217;s seekings into a bare beast frame, <br />
  Hides immortality in a mask of death. <br />
  Once more that Will put on an earthly shape. <br />
  A Mind empowered from Truth&#8217;s immutable seat <br />
  Was framed for vision and interpreting act <br />
  And instruments were sovereignly designed <br />
  To express divinity in terrestrial signs. <br />
  Outlined by the pressure of this new descent <br />
  A lovelier body formed than earth had known. <br />
  As yet a prophecy only and a hint, <br />
  The glowing arc of a charmed unseen whole, <br />
  It came into the sky of mortal life <br />
  Bright like the crescent horn of a gold moon <br />
  Returning in a faint illumined eve. <br />
  At first glimmering like an unshaped idea <br />
  Passive she lay sheltered in wordless sleep, <br />
  Involved and drowned in Matter&#8217;s giant trance, <br />
  An infant heart of the deep-caved world-plan <br />
  In cradle of divine inconscience rocked</p>

<p>By the universal ecstasy of the suns. <br />
  Some missioned Power in the half-wakened frame <br />
  Nursed a transcendent birth&#8217;s dumb glorious seed <br />
  For which this vivid tenement was made. <br />
  But soon the link of soul with form grew sure; <br />
  Flooded was the dim cave with slow conscient light, <br />
  The seed grew into a delicate marvellous bud, <br />
  The bud disclosed a great and heavenly bloom. <br />
  At once she seemed to found a mightier race. <br />
  Arrived upon the strange and dubious globe <br />
  The child remembering inly a far home <br />
  Lived guarded in her spirit&#8217;s luminous cell, <br />
  Alone mid men in her diviner kind. <br />
  Even in her childish movements could be felt <br />
  The nearness of a light still kept from earth, <br />
  Feelings that only eternity could share, <br />
  Thoughts natural and native to the gods. <br />
  As needing nothing but its own rapt flight <br />
  Her nature dwelt in a strong separate air <br />
  Like a strange bird with large rich-coloured breast <br />
  That sojourns on a secret fruited bough, <br />
  Lost in the emerald glory of the woods <br />
  Or flies above divine unreachable tops. <br />
  Harmoniously she impressed the earth with heaven. <br />
  Aligned to a swift rhythm of sheer delight <br />
  And singing to themselves her days went by; <br />
  Each minute was a throb of beauty&#8217;s heart; <br />
  The hours were tuned to a sweet-toned content <br />
  Which asked for nothing, but took all life gave <br />
  Sovereignly as her nature&#8217;s inborn right. <br />
  Near was her spirit to its parent Sun, <br />
  The Breath within to the eternal joy. <br />
  The first fair life that breaks from Nature&#8217;s swoon, <br />
  Mounts in a line of rapture to the skies; <br />
  Absorbed in its own happy urge it lives, <br />
  Sufficient to itself, yet turned to all:</p>

<p>It has no seen communion with its world, <br />
  No open converse with surrounding things. <br />
  There is a oneness native and occult <br />
  That needs no instruments and erects no form; <br />
  In unison it grows with all that is. <br />
  All contacts it assumes into its trance, <br />
  Laugh-tossed consents to the wind&#8217;s kiss and takes <br />
  Transmutingly the shocks of sun and breeze: <br />
  A blissful yearning riots in its leaves, <br />
  A magic passion trembles in its blooms, <br />
  Its boughs aspire in hushed felicity. <br />
  An occult godhead of this beauty is cause, <br />
  The spirit and intimate guest of all this charm, <br />
  This sweetness&#8217;s priestess and this reverie&#8217;s muse. <br />
  Invisibly protected from our sense <br />
  The Dryad lives drenched in a deeper ray <br />
  And feels another air of storms and calms <br />
  And quivers inwardly with mystic rain. <br />
  This at a heavenlier height was shown in her. <br />
  Even when she bent to meet earth&#8217;s intimacies <br />
  Her spirit kept the stature of the gods; <br />
  It stooped but was not lost in Matter&#8217;s reign. <br />
  A world translated was her gleaming mind, <br />
  And marvel-mooned bright crowding fantasies <br />
  Fed with spiritual sustenance of dreams <br />
  The ideal goddess in her house of gold. <br />
  Aware of forms to which our eyes are closed, <br />
  Conscious of nearnesses we cannot feel, <br />
  The Power within her shaped her moulding sense <br />
  In deeper figures than our surface types. <br />
  An invisible sunlight ran within her veins <br />
  And flooded her brain with heavenly brilliances <br />
  That woke a wider sight than earth could know. <br />
  Outlined in the sincerity of that ray <br />
  Her springing childlike thoughts were richly turned <br />
  Into luminous patterns of her soul&#8217;s deep truth,</p>

<p>And from her eyes she cast another look <br />
  On all around her than man&#8217;s ignorant view. <br />
  All objects were to her shapes of living selves <br />
  And she perceived a message from her kin <br />
  In each awakening touch of outward things. <br />
  Each was a symbol power, a vivid flash <br />
  In the circuit of infinities half-known; <br />
  Nothing was alien or inanimate, <br />
  Nothing without its meaning or its call. <br />
  For with a greater Nature she was one. <br />
  As from the soil sprang glory of branch and flower, <br />
  As from the animal&#8217;s life rose thinking man, <br />
  A new epiphany appeared in her. <br />
  A mind of light, a life of rhythmic force, <br />
  A body instinct with hidden divinity <br />
  Prepared an image of the coming god; <br />
  And when the slow rhyme of the expanding years <br />
  And the rich murmurous swarm-work of the days <br />
  Had honey-packed her sense and filled her limbs, <br />
  Accomplishing the moon-orb of her grace, <br />
  Self-guarded in the silence of her strength <br />
  Her solitary greatness was not less. <br />
  Nearer the godhead to the surface pressed, <br />
  A sun replacing childhood&#8217;s nebula <br />
  Sovereign in a blue and lonely sky. <br />
  Upward it rose to grasp the human scene: <br />
  The strong Inhabitant turned to watch her field. <br />
  A lovelier light assumed her spirit brow <br />
  And sweet and solemn grew her musing gaze; <br />
  Celestial-human deep warm slumbrous fires <br />
  Woke in the long fringed glory of her eyes <br />
  Like altar-burnings in a mysteried shrine. <br />
  Out of those crystal windows gleamed a will <br />
  That brought a large significance to life. <br />
  Holding her forehead&#8217;s candid stainless space <br />
  Behind the student arch a noble power</p>
