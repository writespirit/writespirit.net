<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A land of mountains and wide sun-beat plains <br />
  And giant rivers pacing to vast seas, <br />
  A field of creation and spiritual hush, <br />
  Silence swallowing life&#8217;s acts into the deeps, <br />
  Of thought&#8217;s transcendent climb and heavenward leap, <br />
  A brooding world of reverie and trance, <br />
  Filled with the mightiest works of God and man, <br />
  Where Nature seemed a dream of the Divine <br />
  And beauty and grace and grandeur had their home, <br />
  Harboured the childhood of the incarnate Flame. <br />
  Over her watched millennial influences <br />
  And the deep godheads of a grandiose past <br />
  Looked on her and saw the future&#8217;s godheads come <br />
  As if this magnet drew their powers unseen. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s brooding wisdom spoke to her still breast; <br />
  Mounting from mind&#8217;s last peaks to mate with gods, <br />
  Making earth&#8217;s brilliant thoughts a springing-board <br />
  To dive into the cosmic vastnesses, <br />
  The knowledge of the thinker and the seer <br />
  Saw the unseen and thought the unthinkable, <br />
  Opened the enormous doors of the unknown, <br />
  Rent man&#8217;s horizons into infinity. <br />
  A shoreless sweep was lent to the mortal&#8217;s acts, <br />
  And art and beauty sprang from the human depths; <br />
  Nature and soul vied in nobility. <br />
  Ethics the human keyed to imitate heaven; <br />
  The harmony of a rich culture&#8217;s tones <br />
  Refined the sense and magnified its reach <br />
  To hear the unheard and glimpse the invisible <br />
  And taught the soul to soar beyond things known, <br />
  Inspiring life to greaten and break its bounds,</td>

<p>Aspiring to the Immortals&#8217; unseen world. <br />
  Leaving earth&#8217;s safety daring wings of Mind <br />
  Bore her above the trodden fields of thought <br />
  Crossing the mystic seas of the Beyond <br />
  To live on eagle heights near to the Sun. <br />
  There Wisdom sits on her eternal throne. <br />
  All her life&#8217;s turns led her to symbol doors <br />
  Admitting to secret Powers that were her kin; <br />
  Adept of truth, initiate of bliss, <br />
  A mystic acolyte trained in Nature&#8217;s school, <br />
  Aware of the marvel of created things <br />
  She laid the secrecies of her heart&#8217;s deep muse <br />
  Upon the altar of the Wonderful; <br />
  Her hours were a ritual in a timeless fane; <br />
  Her acts became gestures of sacrifice. <br />
  Invested with a rhythm of higher spheres <br />
  The word was used as a hieratic means <br />
  For the release of the imprisoned spirit <br />
  Into communion with its comrade gods. <br />
  Or it helped to beat out new expressive forms <br />
  Of that which labours in the heart of life, <br />
  Some immemorial Soul in men and things, <br />
  Seeker of the unknown and the unborn <br />
  Carrying a light from the Ineffable <br />
  To rend the veil of the last mysteries. <br />
  Intense philosophies pointed earth to heaven <br />
  Or on foundations broad as cosmic Space <br />
  Upraised the earth-mind to superhuman heights. <br />
  Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes <br />
  But hide the sight of that which lives within <br />
  Sculpture and painting concentrated sense <br />
  Upon an inner vision&#8217;s motionless verge, <br />
  Revealed a figure of the invisible, <br />
  Unveiled all Nature&#8217;s meaning in a form, <br />
  Or caught into a body the Divine. <br />
  The architecture of the Infinite</p>

<p>Discovered here its inward-musing shapes <br />
  Captured into wide breadths of soaring stone: <br />
  Music brought down celestial yearnings, song <br />
  Held the merged heart absorbed in rapturous depths, <br />
  Linking the human with the cosmic cry; <br />
  The world-interpreting movements of the dance <br />
  Moulded idea and mood to a rhythmic sway <br />
  And posture; crafts minute in subtle lines <br />
  Eternised a swift moment&#8217;s memory <br />
  Or showed in a carving&#8217;s sweep, a cup&#8217;s design <br />
  The underlying patterns of the unseen: <br />
  Poems in largeness cast like moving worlds <br />
  And metres surging with the ocean&#8217;s voice <br />
  Translated by grandeurs locked in Nature&#8217;s heart <br />
  But thrown now into a crowded glory of speech <br />
  The beauty and sublimity of her forms, <br />
  The passion of her moments and her moods <br />
  Lifting the human word nearer to the god&#8217;s. <br />
  Man&#8217;s eyes could look into the inner realms; <br />
  His scrutiny discovered number&#8217;s law <br />
  And organised the motions of the stars, <br />
  Mapped out the visible fashioning of the world, <br />
  Questioned the process of his thoughts or made <br />
  A theorised diagram of mind and life. <br />
  These things she took in as her nature&#8217;s food, <br />
  But these alone could fill not her wide Self: <br />
  A human seeking limited by its gains, <br />
  To her they seemed the great and early steps <br />
  Hazardous of a young discovering spirit <br />
  Which saw not yet by its own native light; <br />
  It tapped the universe with testing knocks <br />
  Or stretched to find truth mind&#8217;s divining rod; <br />
  There was a growing out to numberless sides, <br />
  But not the widest seeing of the soul, <br />
  Not yet the vast direct immediate touch, <br />
  Nor yet the art and wisdom of the Gods.</p>

<p>A boundless knowledge greater than man&#8217;s thought, <br />
  A happiness too high for heart and sense <br />
  Locked in the world and yearning for release <br />

  It asked for objects around which to grow <br />

  And dreamed of a transcendent action&#8217;s sphere. <br />
  Aware of the universal Self in all <br />
  She turned to living hearts and human forms, <br />
  Her soul&#8217;s reflections, complements, counterparts, <br />
  The close outlying portions of her being <br />
  Divided from her by walls of body and mind <br />
  Yet to her spirit bound by ties divine. <br />
  Overcoming invisible hedge and masked defence <br />
  And the loneliness that separates soul from soul, <br />
  She wished to make all one immense embrace <br />
  That she might house in it all living things <br />
  Raised into a splendid point of seeing light <br />
  Out of division&#8217;s dense inconscient cleft, <br />
  And make them one with God and world and her. <br />
  Only a few responded to her call: <br />
  Still fewer felt the screened divinity <br />
  And strove to mate its godhead with their own, <br />
  Approaching with some kinship to her heights. <br />
  Uplifted towards luminous secrecies <br />
  Or conscious of some splendour hidden above <br />
  They leaped to find her in a moment&#8217;s flash, <br />
  Glimpsing a light in a celestial vast, <br />
  But could not keep the vision and the power <br />
  And fell back to life&#8217;s dull ordinary tone.</p>

<p>A mind daring heavenly experiment, <br />
  Growing towards some largeness they felt near, <br />
  Testing the unknown&#8217;s bound with eager touch <br />
  They still were prisoned by their human grain: <br />
  They could not keep up with her tireless step; <br />
  Too small and eager for her large-paced will, <br />
  Too narrow to look with the unborn Infinite&#8217;s gaze <br />
  Their nature weary grew of things too great. <br />
  For even the close partners of her thoughts <br />
  Who could have walked the nearest to her ray, <br />
  Worshipped the power and light they felt in her <br />
  But could not match the measure of her soul. <br />
  A friend and yet too great wholly to know, <br />
  She walked in their front towards a greater light, <br />
  Their leader and queen over their hearts and souls, <br />
  One close to their bosoms, yet divine and far. <br />
  Admiring and amazed they saw her stride <br />
  Attempting with a godlike rush and leap <br />
  Heights for their human stature too remote <br />
  Or with a slow great many-sided toil <br />
  Pushing towards aims they hardly could conceive; <br />
  Yet forced to be the satellites of her sun <br />
  They moved unable to forego her light, <br />
  Desiring they clutched at her with outstretched hands <br />
  Or followed stumbling in the paths she made. <br />
  Or longing with their self of life and flesh <br />
  They clung to her for heart&#8217;s nourishment and support: <br />
  The rest they could not see in visible light; <br />
  Vaguely they bore her inner mightiness. <br />
  Or bound by the senses and the longing heart, <br />
  Adoring with a turbid human love, <br />
  They could not grasp the mighty spirit she was <br />
  Or change by closeness to be even as she. <br />
  Some felt her with their souls and thrilled with her, <br />
  A greatness felt near yet beyond mind&#8217;s grasp; <br />
  To see her was a summons to adore,</p>

<p>To be near her drew a high communion&#8217;s force. <br />
  So men worship a god too great to know, <br />
  Too high, too vast to wear a limiting shape; <br />
  They feel a Presence and obey a might, <br />
  Adore a love whose rapture invades their breasts; <br />
  To a divine ardour quickening the heart-beats, <br />
  A law they follow greatening heart and life. <br />
  Opened to the breath is a new diviner air, <br />
  Opened to man is a freer, happier world: <br />
  He sees high steps climbing to Self and Light. <br />
  Her divine parts the soul&#8217;s allegiance called: <br />
  It saw, it felt, it knew the deity. <br />
  Her will was puissant on their nature&#8217;s acts, <br />
  Her heart&#8217;s inexhaustible sweetness lured their hearts, <br />
  A being they loved whose bounds exceeded theirs; <br />
  Her measure they could not reach but bore her touch, <br />
  Answering with the flower&#8217;s answer to the sun <br />
  They gave themselves to her and asked no more. <br />
  One greater than themselves, too wide for their ken, <br />
  Their minds could not understand nor wholly know, <br />
  Their lives replied to hers, moved at her words: <br />
  They felt a godhead and obeyed a call, <br />
  Answered to her lead and did her work in the world; <br />
  Their lives, their natures moved compelled by hers <br />
  As if the truth of their own larger selves <br />
  Put on an aspect of divinity <br />
  To exalt them to a pitch beyond their earth&#8217;s. <br />
  They felt a larger future meet their walk; <br />
  She held their hands, she chose for them their paths: <br />
  They were moved by her towards great unknown things, <br />
  Faith drew them and the joy to feel themselves hers; <br />
  They lived in her, they saw the world with her eyes. <br />
  Some turned to her against their nature&#8217;s bent; <br />
  Divided between wonder and revolt, <br />
  Drawn by her charm and mastered by her will, <br />
  Possessed by her, her striving to possess,</p>

  Hugging the bonds close of which they most complained, <br />
  Murmured at a yoke they would have wept to lose, <br />
  The splendid yoke of her beauty and her love: <br />
  Others pursued her with life&#8217;s blind desires <br />
  And claiming all of her as their lonely own, <br />
  Hastened to engross her sweetness meant for all. <br />
  As earth claims light for its lone separate need <br />
  Demanding her for their sole jealous clasp, <br />
  They asked from her movements bounded like their own <br />
  And to their smallness craved a like response. <br />
  Or they repined that she surpassed their grip, <br />
  And hoped to bind her close with longing&#8217;s cords. <br />
  Or finding her touch desired too strong to bear <br />
  They blamed her for a tyranny they loved, <br />
  Shrank into themselves as from too bright a sun, <br />
  Yet hankered for the splendour they refused. <br />
  Angrily enamoured of her sweet passionate ray <br />
  The weakness of their earth could hardly bear, <br />
  They longed but cried out at the touch desired <br />
  Inapt to meet divinity so close, <br />
  Intolerant of a Force they could not house. <br />
  Some drawn unwillingly by her divine sway <br />
  Endured it like a sweet but alien spell; <br />
  Unable to mount to levels too sublime, <br />
  They yearned to draw her down to their own earth. <br />
  Or forced to centre round her their passionate lives, <br />
  They hoped to bind to their heart&#8217;s human needs <br />
  Her glory and grace that had enslaved their souls. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But mid this world, these hearts that answered her call, <br />
  None could stand up her equal and her mate. <br />
  In vain she stooped to equal them with her heights, <br />
  Too pure that air was for small souls to breathe. <br />
  These comrade selves to raise to her own wide breadths <br />
  Her heart desired and fill with her own power</p>

<p>That a diviner Force might enter life, <br />
  A breath of Godhead greaten human time. <br />
  Although she leaned down to their littleness <br />
  Covering their lives with her strong passionate hands <br />
  And knew by sympathy their needs and wants <br />
  And dived in the shallow wave-depths of their lives <br />
  And met and shared their heart-beats of grief and joy <br />
  And bent to heal their sorrow and their pride, <br />
  Lavishing the might that was hers on her lone peak <br />
  To lift to it their aspiration&#8217;s cry, <br />
  And though she drew their souls into her vast <br />
  And surrounded with the silence of her deeps <br />
  And held as the great Mother holds her own, <br />
  Only her earthly surface bore their charge <br />
  And mixed its fire with their mortality: <br />
  Her greater self lived sole, unclaimed, within. <br />
  Oftener in dumb Nature&#8217;s stir and peace <br />
  A nearness she could feel serenely one; <br />
  The Force in her drew earth&#8217;s subhuman broods; <br />
  And to her spirit&#8217;s large and free delight <br />
  She joined the ardent-hued magnificent lives <br />
  Of animal and bird and flower and tree. <br />
  They answered to her with the simple heart. <br />
  In man a dim disturbing somewhat lives; <br />
  It knows but turns away from divine Light <br />
  Preferring the dark ignorance of the fall. <br />
  Among the many who came drawn to her <br />
  Nowhere she found her partner of high tasks, <br />
  The comrade of her soul, her other self <br />
  Who was made with her, like God and Nature, one. <br />
  Some near approached, were touched, caught fire, then failed, <br />
  Too great was her demand, too pure her force. <br />
  Thus lighting earth around her like a sun, <br />
  Yet in her inmost sky an orb aloof, <br />
  A distance severed her from those most close. <br />
  Puissant, apart her soul as the gods live.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As yet unlinked with the broad human scene, <br />
  In a small circle of young eager hearts, <br />
  Her being&#8217;s early school and closed domain, <br />
  Apprentice in the business of earth-life, <br />
  She schooled her heavenly strain to bear its touch, <br />
  Content in her little garden of the gods <br />
  As blooms a flower in an unvisited place. <br />
  Earth nursed, unconscious still, the inhabiting flame, <br />
  Yet something deeply stirred and dimly knew; <br />
  There was a movement and a passionate call, <br />
  A rainbow dream, a hope of golden change; <br />
  Some secret wing of expectation beat, <br />
  A growing sense of something new and rare <br />
  And beautiful stole across the heart of Time. <br />
  Then a faint whisper of her touched the soil, <br />
  Breathed like a hidden need the soul divines; <br />
  The eye of the great world discovered her <br />
  And wonder lifted up its bardic voice. <br />
  A key to a Light still kept in being&#8217;s cave, <br />
  The sun-word of an ancient mystery&#8217;s sense, <br />
  Her name ran murmuring on the lips of men <br />
  Exalted and sweet like an inspired verse <br />
  Struck from the epic lyre of rumour&#8217;s winds <br />
  Or sung like a chanted thought by the poet Fame. <br />
  But like a sacred symbol&#8217;s was that cult. <br />
  Admired, unsought, intangible to the grasp <br />
  Her beauty and flaming strength were seen afar <br />
  Like lightning playing with the fallen day, <br />
  A glory unapproachably divine. <br />
  No equal heart came close to join her heart, <br />
  No transient earthly love assailed her calm, <br />
  No hero passion had the strength to seize; <br />
  No eyes demanded her replying eyes. <br />
  A Power within her awed the imperfect flesh; <br />
  The self-protecting genius in our clay <br />
  Divined the goddess in the woman&#8217;s shape</p>

  The earth-nature bound in sense-life&#8217;s narrow make. <br />
  The hearts of men are amorous of clay-kin <br />
  And bear not spirits lone and high who bring <br />
  Fire-intimations from the deathless planes <br />
  Too vast for souls not born to mate with heaven. <br />
  Whoever is too great must lonely live. <br />
