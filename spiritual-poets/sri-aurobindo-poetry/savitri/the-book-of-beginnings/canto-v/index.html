<p>This knowledge first he had of time-born men. <br />
  Admitted through a curtain of bright mind <br />
  That hangs between our thoughts and absolute sight, <br />
  He found the occult cave, the mystic door <br />
  Near to the well of vision in the soul, <br />
  And entered where the Wings of Glory brood <br />
  In the silent space where all is for ever known. <br />
  Indifferent to doubt and to belief, <br />
  Avid of the naked real&#8217;s single shock <br />
  He shore the cord of mind that ties the earth-heart <br />
  And cast away the yoke of Matter&#8217;s law. <br />
  The body&#8217;s rules bound not the spirit&#8217;s powers: <br />
  When life had stopped its beats, death broke not in; <br />
  He dared to live when breath and thought were still. <br />
  Thus could he step into that magic place <br />
  Which few can even glimpse with hurried glance <br />
  Lifted for a moment from mind&#8217;s laboured works <br />
  And the poverty of Nature&#8217;s earthly sight. <br />
  All that the Gods have learned is there self-known. <br />
  There in a hidden chamber closed and mute <br />
  Are kept the record graphs of the cosmic scribe, <br />
  And there the tables of the sacred Law, <br />
  There is the Book of Being&#8217;s index page; <br />
  The text and glossary of the Vedic truth <br />
  Are there; the rhythms and metres of the stars <br />
  Significant of the movements of our fate: <br />
  The symbol powers of number and of form, <br />
  And the secret code of the history of the world <br />
  And Nature&#8217;s correspondence with the soul <br />
  Are written in the mystic heart of Life.</p>

<p>In the glow of the spirit&#8217;s room of memories <br />
  He could recover the luminous marginal notes <br />
  Dotting with light the crabbed ambiguous scroll, <br />
  Rescue the preamble and the saving clause <br />
  Of the dark Agreement by which all is ruled <br />
  That rises from material Nature&#8217;s sleep <br />
  To clothe the Everlasting in new shapes. <br />
  He could re-read now and interpret new <br />
  Its strange symbol letters, scattered abstruse signs, <br />
  Resolve its oracle and its paradox, <br />
  Its riddling phrases and its blindfold terms, <br />
  The deep oxymoron of its truth&#8217;s repliques, <br />
  And recognise as a just necessity <br />
  Its hard conditions for the mighty work,&#8211; <br />
  Nature&#8217;s impossible Herculean toil <br />
  Only her warlock-wisecraft could enforce, <br />
  Its law of the opposition of the gods, <br />
  Its list of inseparable contraries. <br />
  The dumb great Mother in her cosmic trance <br />
  Exploiting for creation&#8217;s joy and pain <br />
  Infinity&#8217;s sanction to the birth of form, <br />
  Accepts indomitably to execute <br />
  The will to know in an inconscient world, <br />
  The will to live under a reign of death, <br />
  The thirst for rapture in a heart of flesh, <br />
  And works out through the appearance of a soul <br />
  By a miraculous birth in plasm and gas <br />
  The mystery of God&#8217;s covenant with the Night. <br />
  Once more was heard in the still cosmic Mind <br />
  The Eternal&#8217;s promise to his labouring Force <br />
  Inducing the world-passion to begin, <br />
  The cry of birth into mortality <br />
  And the opening verse of the tragedy of Time. <br />
  Out of the depths the world&#8217;s buried secret rose; <br />
  He read the original ukase kept back <br />
  In the locked archives of the spirit&#8217;s crypt,</p>

  Of Wisdom on the dim Power&#8217;s hooded work <br />
  Who builds in Ignorance the steps of Light. <br />
  A sleeping deity opened deathless eyes: <br />
  He saw the unshaped thought in soulless forms, <br />
  Knew Matter pregnant with spiritual sense, <br />
  Mind dare the study of the Unknowable, <br />
  Life its gestation of the Golden Child. <br />
  In the light flooding thought&#8217;s blank vacancy, <br />
  Interpreting the universe by soul signs <br />
  He read from within the text of the without: <br />
  The riddle grew plain and lost its catch obscure. <br />
  A larger lustre lit the mighty page. <br />
  A purpose mingled with the whims of Time, <br />
  A meaning met the stumbling pace of Chance <br />
  And Fate revealed a chain of seeing Will; <br />
  A conscious wideness filled the old dumb Space. <br />
  In the Void he saw throned the Omniscience supreme. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Will, a hope immense now seized his heart, <br />
  And to discern the superhuman&#8217;s form <br />
  He raised his eyes to unseen spiritual heights, <br />
  Aspiring to bring down a greater world. <br />
  The glory he had glimpsed must be his home. <br />
  A brighter heavenlier sun must soon illume <br />
  This dusk room with its dark internal stair, <br />
  The infant soul in its small nursery school <br />
  Mid objects meant for a lesson hardly learned <br />
  Outgrow its early grammar of intellect <br />
  And its imitation of Earth-Nature&#8217;s art, <br />
  Its earthly dialect to God-language change, <br />
  In living symbols study Reality <br />
  And learn the logic of the Infinite. <br />
  The Ideal must be Nature&#8217;s common truth, <br />
  The body illumined with the indwelling God, <br />
  The heart and mind feel one with all that is,</p>

<p>A conscious soul live in a conscious world. <br />
  As through a mist a sovereign peak is seen, <br />
  The greatness of the eternal Spirit appeared, <br />
  Exiled in a fragmented universe <br />
  Amid half-semblances of diviner things. <br />
  These now could serve no more his regal turn; <br />
  The Immortal&#8217;s pride refused the doom to live <br />
  A miser of the scanty bargain made <br />
  Between our littleness and bounded hopes <br />
  And the compassionate Infinitudes. <br />

  A wideness discontented with its frame <br />
  Resiled from poor assent to Nature&#8217;s terms, <br />
  The harsh contract spurned and the diminished lease. <br />
  Only beginnings are accomplished here; <br />
  Our base&#8217;s Matter seems alone complete, <br />
  An absolute machine without a soul. <br />
  Or all seems a misfit of half ideas, <br />
  Or we saddle with the vice of earthly form <br />
  A hurried imperfect glimpse of heavenly things, <br />
  Guesses and travesties of celestial types. <br />
  Here chaos sorts itself into a world, <br />
  A brief formation drifting in the void: <br />
  Apings of knowledge, unfinished arcs of power, <br />
  Flamings of beauty into earthly shapes, <br />
  Love&#8217;s broken reflexes of unity <br />
  Swim, fragment-mirrorings of a floating sun. <br />
  A packed assemblage of crude tentative lives <br />
  Are pieced into a tessellated whole. <br />
  There is no perfect answer to our hopes; <br />
  There are blind voiceless doors that have no key; <br />
  Thought climbs in vain and brings a borrowed light, <br />
  Cheated by counterfeits sold to us in life&#8217;s mart, <br />
  Our hearts clutch at a forfeited heavenly bliss. <br />
  There is provender for the mind&#8217;s satiety, <br />
  There are thrills of the flesh, but not the soul&#8217;s desire.</p>

  Is a mimicry of ungrasped beatitudes, <br />
  A mutilated statue of ecstasy, <br />
  A wounded happiness that cannot live, <br />
  A brief felicity of mind or sense <br />
  Thrown by the World-Power to her body-slave, <br />
  Or a simulacrum of enforced delight <br />
  In the seraglios of Ignorance. <br />
  For all we have acquired soon loses worth, <br />
  An old disvalued credit in Time&#8217;s bank, <br />
  Imperfection&#8217;s cheque drawn on the Inconscient. <br />
  An inconsequence dogs every effort made, <br />
  And chaos waits on every cosmos formed: <br />
  In each success a seed of failure lurks. <br />
  He saw the doubtfulness of all things here, <br />
  The incertitude of man&#8217;s proud confident thought, <br />
  The transience of the achievements of his force. <br />
  A thinking being in an unthinking world, <br />
  An island in the sea of the Unknown, <br />
  He is a smallness trying to be great, <br />
  An animal with some instincts of a god, <br />
  His life a story too common to be told, <br />
  His deeds a number summing up to nought, <br />
  His consciousness a torch lit to be quenched, <br />
  His hope a star above a cradle and grave. <br />
  And yet a greater destiny may be his, <br />
  For the eternal Spirit is his truth. <br />
  He can re-create himself and all around <br />
  And fashion new the world in which he lives: <br />
  He, ignorant, is the Knower beyond Time, <br />
  He is the Self above Nature, above Fate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; His soul retired from all that he had done. <br />
  Hushed was the futile din of human toil, <br />
  Forsaken wheeled the circle of the days; <br />
  In distance sank the crowded tramp of life.</p>

  Impassive he lived immune from earthly hopes, <br />
  A figure in the ineffable Witness&#8217; shrine <br />
  Pacing the vast cathedral of his thoughts <br />
  Under its arches dim with infinity <br />
  And heavenward brooding of invisible wings. <br />
  A call was on him from intangible heights; <br />
  Indifferent to the little outpost Mind, <br />
  He dwelt in the wideness of the Eternal&#8217;s reign. <br />
  His being now exceeded thinkable Space, <br />
  His boundless thought was neighbour to cosmic sight: <br />
  A universal light was in his eyes, <br />
  A golden influx flowed through heart and brain; <br />
  A Force came down into his mortal limbs, <br />
  A current from eternal seas of Bliss; <br />
  He felt the invasion and the nameless joy. <br />
  Aware of his occult omnipotent Source, <br />
  Allured by the omniscient Ecstasy, <br />
  A living centre of the Illimitable <br />
  Widened to equate with the world&#8217;s circumference, <br />
  He turned to his immense spiritual fate. <br />
  Abandoned on a canvas of torn air, <br />
  A picture lost in far and fading streaks, <br />
  The earth-nature&#8217;s summits sank below his feet: <br />
  He climbed to meet the infinite more above. <br />
  The Immobile&#8217;s ocean-silence saw him pass, <br />
  An arrow leaping through eternity <br />
  Suddenly shot from the tense bow of Time, <br />
  A ray returning to its parent sun. <br />
  Opponent of that glory of escape, <br />
  The black Inconscient swung its dragon tail <br />
  Lashing a slumbrous Infinite by its force <br />
  Into the deep obscurities of form: <br />
  Death lay beneath him like a gate of sleep. <br />
  One-pointed to the immaculate Delight, <br />
  Questing for God as for a splendid prey,</p>

  To a few is given that godlike rare release. <br />
  One among many thousands never touched, <br />
  Engrossed in the external world&#8217;s design, <br />
  Is chosen by a secret witness Eye <br />
  And driven by a pointing hand of Light <br />
  Across his soul&#8217;s unmapped immensitudes. <br />
  A pilgrim of the everlasting Truth, <br />
  Our measures cannot hold his measureless mind; <br />

  And left the little lane of human Time. <br />
  In the hushed precincts of a vaster plan <br />
  He treads the vestibules of the Unseen, <br />
  Or listens following a bodiless Guide <br />
  To a lonely cry in boundless vacancy. <br />
  All the deep cosmic murmur falling still, <br />
  He lives in the hush before the world was born, <br />
  His soul left naked to the timeless One. <br />
  Far from compulsion of created things <br />
  Thought and its shadowy idols disappear, <br />
  The moulds of form and person are undone: <br />
  The ineffable Wideness knows him for its own. <br />
  A lone forerunner of the Godward earth, <br />
  Among the symbols of yet unshaped things <br />
  Watched by closed eyes, mute faces of the Unborn, <br />
  He journeys to meet the Incommunicable, <br />
  Hearing the echo of his single steps <br />
  In the eternal courts of Solitude. <br />
  A nameless Marvel fills the motionless hours. <br />
  His spirit mingles with eternity&#8217;s heart <br />
  And bears the silence of the Infinite. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a divine retreat from mortal thought, <br />
  In a prodigious gesture of soul-sight, <br />
  His being towered into pathless heights, <br />
  Naked of its vesture of humanity.</p>

  A strong Descent leaped down. A Might, a Flame, <br />
  A Beauty half-visible with deathless eyes, <br />
  A violent Ecstasy, a Sweetness dire, <br />
  Enveloped him with its stupendous limbs <br />
  And penetrated nerve and heart and brain <br />
  That thrilled and fainted with the epiphany: <br />
  His nature shuddered in the Unknown&#8217;s grasp. <br />
  In a moment shorter than death, longer than Time, <br />
  By a Power more ruthless than Love, happier than Heaven, <br />
  Taken sovereignly into eternal arms, <br />
  Haled and coerced by a stark absolute bliss, <br />
  In a whirlwind circuit of delight and force <br />
  Hurried into unimaginable depths, <br />
  Upborne into immeasurable heights, <br />
  It was torn out from its mortality <br />
  And underwent a new and bourneless change. <br />
  An Omniscient knowing without sight or thought, <br />
  An indecipherable Omnipotence, <br />
  A mystic Form that could contain the worlds, <br />
  Yet make one human breast its passionate shrine, <br />
  Drew him out of his seeking loneliness <br />
  Into the magnitudes of God&#8217;s embrace. <br />
  As when a timeless Eye annuls the hours <br />
  Abolishing the agent and the act, <br />
  So now his spirit shone out wide, blank, pure: <br />
  His wakened mind became an empty slate <br />
  On which the Universal and Sole could write. <br />
  All that represses our fallen consciousness <br />
  Was taken from him like a forgotten load: <br />
  A fire that seemed the body of a god <br />
  Consumed the limiting figures of the past <br />
  And made large room for a new self to live. <br />
  Eternity&#8217;s contact broke the moulds of sense. <br />
  A greater Force than the earthly held his limbs, <br />
  Huge workings bared his undiscovered sheaths,</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A magic porch of entry glimmering <br />
  Quivered in a penumbra of screened Light, <br />
  A court of the mystical traffic of the worlds, <br />
  A balcony and miraculous facade. <br />
  Above her lightened high immensities; <br />
  All the unknown looked out from boundlessness: <br />
  It lodged upon an edge of hourless Time, <br />
  Gazing out of some everlasting Now, <br />
  Its shadows gleaming with the birth of gods, <br />
  Its bodies signalling the Bodiless, <br />
  Its foreheads glowing with the Oversoul, <br />
  Its forms projected from the Unknowable, <br />
  Its eyes dreaming of the Ineffable, <br />
  Its faces staring into eternity. <br />
  Life in him learned its huge subconscient rear; <br />
  The little fronts unlocked to the unseen Vasts: <br />
  Her gulfs stood nude, her far transcendences <br />
  Flamed in transparencies of crowded light. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A giant order was discovered here <br />
  Of which the tassel and extended fringe <br />
  Are the scant stuff of our material lives. <br />
  This overt universe whose figures hide <br />
  The secrets merged in superconscient light, <br />
  Wrote clear the letters of its glowing code: <br />
  A map of subtle signs surpassing thought <br />
  Was hung upon a wall of inmost mind. <br />
  Illumining the world&#8217;s concrete images <br />
  Into significant symbols by its gloss, <br />
  It offered to the intuitive exegete <br />
  Its reflex of the eternal Mystery. <br />
  Ascending and descending twixt life&#8217;s poles <br />
  The seried kingdoms of the graded Law <br />
  Plunged from the Everlasting into Time, <br />
  Then glad of a glory of multitudinous mind <br />
  And rich with life&#8217;s adventure and delight</p>

<p>And packed with the beauty of Matter&#8217;s shapes and hues <br />
  Climbed back from Time into undying Self, <br />
  Up a golden ladder carrying the soul, <br />
  Tying with diamond threads the Spirit&#8217;s extremes. <br />
  In this drop from consciousness to consciousness <br />
  Each leaned on the occult Inconscient&#8217;s power, <br />
  The fountain of its needed Ignorance, <br />
  Archmason of the limits by which it lives. <br />
  In this soar from consciousness to consciousness <br />
  Each lifted tops to That from which it came, <br />
  Origin of all that it had ever been <br />
  And home of all that it could still become. <br />
  An organ scale of the Eternal&#8217;s acts, <br />
  Mounting to their climax in an endless Calm, <br />
  Paces of the many-visaged Wonderful, <br />
  Predestined stadia of the evolving Way, <br />
  Measures of the stature of the growing soul, <br />
  They interpreted existence to itself <br />
  And, mediating twixt the heights and deeps, <br />
  United the veiled married opposites <br />
  And linked creation to the Ineffable. <br />
  A last high world was seen where all worlds meet; <br />
  In its summit gleam where Night is not nor Sleep, <br />
  The light began of the Trinity supreme. <br />
  All there discovered what it seeks for here. <br />
  It freed the finite into boundlessness <br />
  And rose into its own eternities. <br />
  The Inconscient found its heart of consciousness, <br />
  The idea and feeling groping in Ignorance <br />
  At last clutched passionately the body of Truth, <br />
  The music born in Matter&#8217;s silences <br />
  Plucked nude out of the Ineffable&#8217;s fathomlessness <br />
  The meaning it had held but could not voice; <br />
  The perfect rhythm now only sometimes dreamed <br />
  An answer brought to the torn earth&#8217;s hungry need <br />
  Rending the night that had concealed the Unknown,</p>

<p>Giving to her her lost forgotten soul. <br />
  A grand solution closed the long impasse <br />
  In which the heights of mortal effort end. <br />
  A reconciling Wisdom looked on life; <br />
  It took the striving undertones of mind <br />
  And took the confused refrain of human hopes <br />
  And made of them a sweet and happy call; <br />
  It lifted from an underground of pain <br />
  The inarticulate murmur of our lives <br />
  And found for it a sense illimitable. <br />
  A mighty oneness its perpetual theme, <br />
  It caught the soul&#8217;s faint scattered utterances, <br />
  Read hardly twixt our lines of rigid thought <br />
  Or mid this drowse and coma on Matter&#8217;s breast <br />
  Heard like disjointed mutterings in sleep; <br />
  It grouped the golden links that they had lost <br />
  And showed to them their divine unity, <br />
  Saving from the error of divided self <br />
  The deep spiritual cry in all that is. <br />
  All the great Words that toiled to express the One <br />
  Were lifted into an absoluteness of light, <br />
  An ever-burning Revelation&#8217;s fire <br />
  And the immortality of the eternal Voice. <br />
  There was no quarrel more of truth with truth; <br />
  The endless chapter of their differences <br />
  Retold in light by an omniscient Scribe <br />
  Travelled through difference towards unity, <br />
  Mind&#8217;s winding search lost every tinge of doubt <br />
  Led to its end by an all-seeing speech <br />
  That garbed the initial and original thought <br />
  With the finality of an ultimate phrase: <br />
  United were Time&#8217;s creative mood and tense <br />
  To the style and syntax of Identity. <br />
  A paean swelled from the lost musing deeps; <br />
  An anthem pealed to the triune ecstasies, <br />
  A cry of the moments to the Immortal&#8217;s bliss.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">As if the strophes of a cosmic ode, <br />
  A hierarchy of climbing harmonies <br />
  Peopled with voices and with visages <br />
  Aspired in a crescendo of the Gods <br />
  From Matter&#8217;s abysses to the Spirit&#8217;s peaks. <br />
  Above were the Immortal&#8217;s changeless seats, <br />
  White chambers of dalliance with eternity <br />
  And the stupendous gates of the Alone. <br />
  Across the unfolding of the seas of self <br />
  Appeared the deathless countries of the One. <br />
  A many-miracled Consciousness unrolled <br />
  Vast aim and process and unfettered norms, <br />
  A larger Nature&#8217;s great familiar roads. <br />
  Affranchised from the net of earthly sense <br />
  Calm continents of potency were glimpsed; <br />
  Homelands of beauty shut to human eyes, <br />
  Half-seen at first through wonder&#8217;s gleaming lids, <br />
  Surprised the vision with felicity; <br />
  Sunbelts of knowledge, moonbelts of delight <br />
  Stretched out in an ecstasy of widenesses <br />
  Beyond our indigent corporeal range. <br />
  There he could enter, there awhile abide. <br />
  A voyager upon uncharted routes <br />
  Fronting the viewless danger of the Unknown, <br />
  Adventuring across enormous realms, <br />
  He broke into another Space and Time. </p>
