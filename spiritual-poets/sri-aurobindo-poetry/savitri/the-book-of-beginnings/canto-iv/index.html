  Our early approaches to the Infinite<br />
  Are sunrise splendours on a marvellous verge<br />
  While lingers yet unseen the glorious sun.<br />
  What now we see is a shadow of what must come.<br />
  The earth&#8217;s uplook to a remote Unknown<br />
  Is a preface only of the epic climb<br />
  Of human soul from its flat earthly state<br />
  To the discovery of a greater self<br />
  And the far gleam of an eternal Light.<br />
  This world is a beginning and a base<br />
  Where Life and Mind erect their structured dreams;<br />
  An unborn Power must build reality.<br />
  A deathbound littleness is not all we are:<br />
  Immortal our forgotten vastnesses<br />
  Await discovery in our summit selves;<br />
  Unmeasured breadths and depths of being are ours.<br />
  Akin to the ineffable Secrecy,<br />
  Mystic, eternal in unrealised Time,<br />
  Neighbours of Heaven are Nature&#8217;s altitudes.<br />
  To these high-peaked dominions sealed to our search,<br />
  Too far from surface Nature&#8217;s postal routes,<br />
  Too lofty for our mortal lives to breathe,<br />
  Deep in us a forgotten kinship points<br />
  And a faint voice of ecstasy and prayer<br />
  Calls to those lucent lost immensities.<br />
  Even when we fail to look into our souls<br />
  Or lie embedded in earthly consciousness,<br />
  Still have we parts that grow towards the light,<br />
  Yet are there luminous tracts and heavens serene<br />
  And Eldorados of splendour and ecstasy

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">And temples to the godhead none can see.<br />
  A shapeless memory lingers in us still<br />
  And sometimes, when our sight is turned within,<br />
  Earth&#8217;s ignorant veil is lifted from our eyes;<br />
  There is a short miraculous escape.<br />
  This narrow fringe of clamped experience<br />
  We leave behind meted to us as life,<br />
  Our little walks, our insufficient reach.<br />
  Our souls can visit in great lonely hours<br />
  Still regions of imperishable Light,<br />
  All-seeing eagle-peaks of silent Power<br />
  And moon-flame oceans of swift fathomless Bliss<br />
  And calm immensities of spirit space.<br />
  In the unfolding process of the Self<br />
  Sometimes the inexpressible Mystery<br />
  Elects a human vessel of descent.<br />
  A breath comes down from a supernal air,<br />
  A Presence is born, a guiding Light awakes,<br />
  A stillness falls upon the instruments:<br />
  Fixed, motionless like a marble monument,<br />
  Stone-calm, the body is a pedestal<br />
  Supporting a figure of eternal Peace.<br />
  Or a revealing Force sweeps blazing in;<br />
  Out of some vast superior continent<br />
  Knowledge breaks through trailing its radiant seas,<br />
  And Nature trembles with the power, the flame.<br />
  A greater Personality sometimes<br />
  Possesses us which yet we know is ours:<br />
  Or we adore the Master of our souls.<br />
  Then the small bodily ego thins and falls;<br />
  No more insisting on its separate self,<br />
  Losing the punctilio of its separate birth,<br />
  It leaves us one with Nature and with God.<br />
  In moments when the inner lamps are lit<br />
  And the life&#8217;s cherished guests are left outside,<br />
  Our spirit sits alone and speaks to its gulfs.</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A wider consciousness opens then its doors;<br />
  Invading from spiritual silences<br />
  A ray of the timeless Glory stoops awhile<br />
  To commune with our seized illumined clay<br />
  And leaves its huge white stamp upon our lives.<br />
  In the oblivious field of mortal mind,<br />
  Revealed to the closed prophet eyes of trance<br />
  Or in some deep internal solitude<br />
  Witnessed by a strange immaterial sense,<br />
  The signals of eternity appear.<br />
  The truth mind could not know unveils its face,<br />
  We hear what mortal ears have never heard,<br />
  We feel what earthly sense has never felt,<br />
  We love what common hearts repel and dread;<br />
  Our minds hush to a bright Omniscient;<br />
  A Voice calls from the chambers of the soul;<br />
  We meet the ecstasy of the Godhead&#8217;s touch<br />
  In golden privacies of immortal fire.<br />
  These signs are native to a larger self<br />
  That lives within us by ourselves unseen;<br />
  Only sometimes a holier influence comes,<br />
  A tide of mightier surgings bears our lives<br />
  And a diviner Presence moves the soul;<br />
  Or through the earthly coverings something breaks,<br />
  A grace and beauty of spiritual light,<br />
  The murmuring tongue of a celestial fire.<br />
  Ourself and a high stranger whom we feel,<br />
  It is and acts unseen as if it were not;<br />
  It follows the line of sempiternal birth,<br />
  Yet seems to perish with its mortal frame.<br />
  Assured of the Apocalypse to be,<br />
  It reckons not the moments and the hours;<br />
  Great, patient, calm it sees the centuries pass,<br />
  Awaiting the slow miracle of our change<br />
  In the sure deliberate process of world-force<br />
  And the long march of all-revealing Time.</td>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">It is the origin and the master-clue, <br />
  A silence overhead, an inner voice, <br />
  A living image seated in the heart, <br />
  An unwalled wideness and a fathomless point, <br />
  The truth of all these cryptic shows in Space, <br />
  The Real towards which our strivings move, <br />
  The secret grandiose meaning of our lives. <br />
  A treasure of honey in the combs of God, <br />
  A Splendour burning in a tenebrous cloak, <br />
  It is our glory of the flame of God, <br />
  Our golden fountain of the world&#8217;s delight, <br />
  An immortality cowled in the cape of death, <br />
  The shape of our unborn divinity. <br />
  It guards for us our fate in depths within <br />
  Where sleeps the eternal seed of transient things. <br />
  Always we bear in us a magic key <br />
  Concealed in life&#8217;s hermetic envelope. <br />
  A burning Witness in the sanctuary <br />
  Regards through Time and the blind walls of Form; <br />
  A timeless Light is in his hidden eyes; <br />
  He sees the secret things no words can speak <br />
  And knows the goal of the unconscious world <br />
  And the heart of the mystery of the journeying years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But all is screened, subliminal, mystical; <br />
  It needs the intuitive heart, the inward turn, <br />
  It needs the power of a spiritual gaze. <br />
  Else to our waking mind&#8217;s small moment look <br />
  A goalless voyage seems our dubious course <br />
  Some Chance has settled or hazarded some Will, <br />
  Or a Necessity without aim or cause <br />
  Unwillingly compelled to emerge and be. <br />
  In this dense field where nothing is plain or sure, <br />
  Our very being seems to us questionable, <br />
  Our life a vague experiment, the soul <br />
  A flickering light in a strange ignorant world,</p>

<p>The earth a brute mechanic accident, <br />
  A net of death in which by chance we live. <br />
  All we have learned appears a doubtful guess, <br />
  The achievement done a passage or a phase <br />
  Whose farther end is hidden from our sight, <br />
  A chance happening or a fortuitous fate. <br />
  Out of the unknown we move to the unknown. <br />
  Ever surround our brief existence here <br />
  Grey shadows of unanswered questionings; <br />
  The dark Inconscient&#8217;s signless mysteries <br />
  Stand up unsolved behind Fate&#8217;s starting-line. <br />
  An aspiration in the Night&#8217;s profound, <br />
  Seed of a perishing body and half-lit mind, <br />
  Uplifts its lonely tongue of conscious fire <br />
  Towards an undying Light for ever lost; <br />
  Only it hears, sole echo of its call, <br />
  The dim reply in man&#8217;s unknowing heart <br />
  And meets, not understanding why it came <br />
  Or for what reason is the suffering here, <br />
  God&#8217;s sanction to the paradox of life <br />
  And the riddle of the Immortal&#8217;s birth in Time. <br />
  Along a path of aeons serpentine <br />
  In the coiled blackness of her nescient course <br />
  The Earth-Goddess toils across the sands of Time. <br />
  A Being is in her whom she hopes to know, <br />
  A Word speaks to her heart she cannot hear, <br />
  A Fate compels whose form she cannot see. <br />
  In her unconscious orbit through the Void <br />
  Out of her mindless depths she strives to rise, <br />
  A perilous life her gain, a struggling joy; <br />
  A Thought that can conceive but hardly knows <br />
  Arises slowly in her and creates <br />
  The idea, the speech that labels more than it lights; <br />
  A trembling gladness that is less than bliss <br />
  Invades from all this beauty that must die. <br />
  Alarmed by the sorrow dragging at her feet</p>

  Ever she nurses in her sleepless breast <br />
  An inward urge that takes from her rest and peace. <br />
  Ignorant and weary and invincible, <br />
  She seeks through the soul&#8217;s war and quivering pain <br />
  The pure perfection her marred nature needs, <br />
  A breath of Godhead on her stone and mire. <br />
  A faith she craves that can survive defeat, <br />

  Herself and all of which she is the sign. <br />
  An inarticulate whisper drives her steps <br />
  Of which she feels the force but not the sense; <br />
  A few rare intimations come as guides, <br />
  Immense divining flashes cleave her brain, <br />
  And sometimes in her hours of dream and muse <br />
  The truth that she has missed looks out on her <br />
  As if far off and yet within her soul. <br />
  A change comes near that flees from her surmise <br />
  And, ever postponed, compels attempt and hope, <br />

  Approaching with estranged great luminous gaze. <br />
  Then is she moved to all that she is not <br />
  And stretches arms to what was never hers. <br />
  Outstretching arms to the unconscious Void, <br />
  Passionate she prays to invisible forms of Gods <br />
  Soliciting from dumb Fate and toiling Time <br />
  What most she needs, what most exceeds her scope, <br />
  A Mind unvisited by illusion&#8217;s gleams, <br />
  A Will expressive of soul&#8217;s deity, <br />
  A Strength not forced to stumble by its speed,</p>

<p>A Joy that drags not sorrow as its shade. <br />
  For these she yearns and feels them destined hers: <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s privilege she claims as her own right. <br />
  Just is her claim the all-witnessing Gods approve, <br />
  Clear in a greater light than reason owns: <br />
  Our intuitions are its title-deeds; <br />
  Our souls accept what our blind thoughts refuse. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s winged chimaeras are Truth&#8217;s steeds in Heaven, <br />
  The impossible God&#8217;s sign of things to be. <br />
  But few can look beyond the present state <br />
  Or overleap this matted hedge of sense. <br />
  All that transpires on earth and all beyond <br />
  Are parts of an illimitable plan <br />
  The One keeps in his heart and knows alone. <br />
  Our outward happenings have their seed within, <br />
  And even this random Fate that imitates Chance, <br />
  This mass of unintelligible results, <br />
  Are the dumb graph of truths that work unseen: <br />
  The laws of the Unknown create the known. <br />
  The events that shape the appearance of our lives <br />
  Are a cipher of subliminal quiverings <br />
  Which rarely we surprise or vaguely feel, <br />
  Are an outcome of suppressed realities <br />
  That hardly rise into material day: <br />
  They are born from the spirit&#8217;s sun of hidden powers <br />
  Digging a tunnel through emergency. <br />
  But who shall pierce into the cryptic gulf <br />
  And learn what deep necessity of the soul <br />
  Determined casual deed and consequence? <br />
  Absorbed in a routine of daily acts, <br />
  Our eyes are fixed on an external scene; <br />
  We hear the crash of the wheels of Circumstance <br />
  And wonder at the hidden cause of things. <br />
  Yet a foreseeing Knowledge might be ours, <br />
  If we could take our spirit&#8217;s stand within, <br />
  If we could hear the muffled daemon voice.</p>

<p>Too seldom is the shadow of what must come <br />
  Cast in an instant on the secret sense <br />
  Which feels the shock of the invisible, <br />
  And seldom in the few who answer give <br />
  The mighty process of the cosmic Will <br />
  Communicates its image to our sight, <br />
  Identifying the world&#8217;s mind with ours. <br />
  Our range is fixed within the crowded arc <br />
  Of what we observe and touch and thought can guess <br />
  And rarely dawns the light of the Unknown <br />
  Waking in us the prophet and the seer. <br />
  The outward and the immediate are our field, <br />
  The dead past is our background and support; <br />
  Mind keeps the soul prisoner, we are slaves to our acts; <br />
  We cannot free our gaze to reach wisdom&#8217;s sun. <br />
  Inheritor of the brief animal mind, <br />
  Man, still a child in Nature&#8217;s mighty hands, <br />
  In the succession of the moments lives; <br />
  To a changing present is his narrow right; <br />
  His memory stares back at a phantom past, <br />
  The future flees before him as he moves; <br />
  He sees imagined garments, not a face. <br />
  Armed with a limited precarious strength, <br />
  He saves his fruits of work from adverse chance. <br />
  A struggling ignorance is his wisdom&#8217;s mate: <br />
  He waits to see the consequence of his acts, <br />
  He waits to weigh the certitude of his thoughts, <br />
  He knows not what he shall achieve or when; <br />
  He knows not whether at last he shall survive, <br />
  Or end like the mastodon and the sloth <br />
  And perish from the earth where he was king. <br />
  He is ignorant of the meaning of his life, <br />
  He is ignorant of his high and splendid fate. <br />
  Only the Immortals on their deathless heights <br />
  Dwelling beyond the walls of Time and Space, <br />
  Masters of living, free from the bonds of Thought,</p>

  Across the triumph, fighting and despair, <br />

  On the long road which cannot see its end <br />
  Winding undetected through the sceptic days</p>

  It lends a purport to a random world. <br />
  A conjecture leaning upon doubtful proofs, <br />
  A message misunderstood, a thought confused <br />
  Missing its aim is all that it can speak <br />
  Or a fragment of the universal word. <br />
  It leaves two giant letters void of sense <br />

  A portion of a parable sublime. <br />

  The conscious Force that acts in Nature&#8217;s breast, <br />
  A dark-robed labourer in the cosmic scheme <br />
  Carrying clay images of unborn gods, <br />
  Executrix of the inevitable Idea <br />
  Hampered, enveloped by the hoops of Fate, <br />
  Patient trustee of slow eternal Time, <br />
  Absolves from hour to hour her secret charge. <br />
  All she foresees in masked imperative depths; <br />
  The dumb intention of the unconscious gulfs <br />
  Answers to a will that sees upon the heights, <br />
  And the evolving Word&#8217;s first syllable <br />
  Ponderous, brute-sensed, contains its luminous close, <br />
  Privy to a summit victory&#8217;s vast descent <br />
  And the portent of the soul&#8217;s immense uprise. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All here where each thing seems its lonely self <br />
  Are figures of the sole transcendent One: <br />
  Only by him they are, his breath is their life; <br />
  An unseen Presence moulds the oblivious clay. <br />
  A playmate in the mighty Mother&#8217;s game, <br />
  One came upon the dubious whirling globe <br />
  To hide from her pursuit in force and form. <br />
  A secret spirit in the Inconscient&#8217;s sleep, <br />
  A shapeless Energy, a voiceless Word, <br />
  He was here before the elements could emerge, <br />
  Before there was light of mind or life could breathe. <br />
  Accomplice of her cosmic huge pretence,</p>

<p>His semblances he turns to real shapes <br />
  And makes the symbol equal with the truth: <br />
  He gives to his timeless thoughts a form in Time. <br />
  He is the substance, he the self of things; <br />
  She has forged from him her works of skill and might: <br />
  She wraps him in the magic of her moods <br />
  And makes of his myriad truths her countless dreams. <br />
  The Master of being has come down to her, <br />
  An immortal child born in the fugitive years. <br />
  In objects wrought, in the persons she conceives, <br />
  Dreaming she chases her idea of him, <br />
  And catches here a look and there a gest: <br />
  Ever he repeats in them his ceaseless births. <br />
  He is the Maker and the world he made, <br />
  He is the vision and he is the Seer; <br />
  He is himself the actor and the act, <br />
  He is himself the knower and the known, <br />
  He is himself the dreamer and the dream. <br />
  There are Two who are One and play in many worlds; <br />
  In Knowledge and Ignorance they have spoken and met <br />
  And light and darkness are their eyes&#8217; interchange; <br />
  Our pleasure and pain are their wrestle and embrace, <br />
  Our deeds, our hopes are intimate to their tale; <br />
  They are married secretly in our thought and life. <br />
  The universe is an endless masquerade: <br />
  For nothing here is utterly what it seems; <br />
  It is a dream-fact vision of a truth <br />
  Which but for the dream would not be wholly true, <br />
  A phenomenon stands out significant <br />
  Against dim backgrounds of eternity; <br />
  We accept its face and pass by all it means; <br />
  A part is seen, we take it for the whole. <br />
  Thus have they made their play with us for roles: <br />
  Author and actor with himself as scene, <br />
  He moves there as the Soul, as Nature she. <br />
  Here on the earth where we must fill our parts,</p>

  Our uttered sentences veil in their thought. <br />
  Her mighty plan she holds back from our sight: <br />
  She has concealed her glory and her bliss <br />
  And disguised the Love and Wisdom in her heart; <br />
  Of all the marvel and beauty that are hers, <br />
  Only a darkened little we can feel. <br />
  He too wears a diminished godhead here; <br />
  He has forsaken his omnipotence, <br />

  He knows her only, he has forgotten himself; <br />
  To her he abandons all to make her great. <br />
  He hopes in her to find himself anew, <br />
  Incarnate, wedding his infinity&#8217;s peace <br />
  To her creative passion&#8217;s ecstasy. <br />
  Although possessor of the earth and heavens, <br />
  He leaves to her the cosmic management <br />
  And watches all, the Witness of her scene. <br />
  A supernumerary on her stage, <br />
  He speaks no words or hides behind the wings. <br />
  He takes birth in her world, waits on her will, <br />
  Divines her enigmatic gesture&#8217;s sense, <br />
  The fluctuating chance turns of her mood, <br />
  Works out her meanings she seems not to know <br />
  And serves her secret purpose in long Time. <br />
  As one too great for him he worships her; <br />
  He adores her as his regent of desire, <br />
  He yields to her as the mover of his will, <br />
  He burns the incense of his nights and days <br />
  Offering his life, a splendour of sacrifice. <br />
  A rapt solicitor for her love and grace, <br />
  His bliss in her to him is his whole world: <br />
  He grows through her in all his being&#8217;s powers; <br />
  He reads by her God&#8217;s hidden aim in things. <br />
  Or, a courtier in her countless retinue, <br />
  Content to be with her and feel her near</p>

  And all she does drapes with his own delight. <br />
  A glance can make his whole day wonderful, <br />
  A word from her lips with happiness wings the hours. <br />
  He leans on her for all he does and is: <br />
  He builds on her largesses his proud fortunate days <br />
  And trails his peacock-plumaged joy of life <br />
  And suns in the glory of her passing smile. <br />
  In a thousand ways he serves her royal needs; <br />

  The Two who are one are the secret of all power, <br />
  The Two who are one are the might and right in things. <br />
  His soul, silent, supports the world and her, <br />
  His acts are her commandment&#8217;s registers. <br />
  Happy, inert, he lies beneath her feet: <br />
  His breast he offers for her cosmic dance <br />
  Of which our lives are the quivering theatre, <br />
  And none could bear but for his strength within, <br />
  Yet none would leave because of his delight. <br />
  His works, his thoughts have been devised by her, <br />

  Active, inspired by her he speaks and moves; <br />
  His deeds obey her heart&#8217;s unspoken demands: <br />
  Passive, he bears the impacts of the world <br />
  As if her touches shaping his soul and life: <br />
  His journey through the days is her sun-march; <br />
  He runs upon her roads; hers is his course. <br />
  A witness and student of her joy and dole, <br />
  A partner in her evil and her good, <br />
  He has consented to her passionate ways, <br />
  He is driven by her sweet and dreadful force. <br />

  Where all is deep and strange to the eyes that see <br />

<p>Hangs round him no longer its translucent veil. <br />
  He has crossed the limit of mortal thought and hope, <br />
  He has reached the world&#8217;s end and stares beyond; <br />
  The eyes of mortal body plunge their gaze <br />
  Into Eyes that look upon eternity. <br />
  A greater world Time&#8217;s traveller must explore. <br />
  At last he hears a chanting on the heights <br />
  And the far speaks and the unknown grows near: <br />
  He crosses the boundaries of the unseen <br />
  And passes over the edge of mortal sight <br />
  To a new vision of himself and things. <br />
  He is a spirit in an unfinished world <br />
  That knows him not and cannot know itself: <br />
  The surface symbol of his goalless quest <br />
  Takes deeper meanings to his inner view; <br />
  His is a search of darkness for the light, <br />
  Of mortal life for immortality. <br />
  In the vessel of an earthly embodiment <br />
  Over the narrow rails of limiting sense <br />
  He looks out on the magic waves of Time <br />
  Where mind like a moon illumines the world&#8217;s dark. <br />
  There is limned ever retreating from the eyes, <br />
  As if in a tenuous misty dream-light drawn, <br />
  The outline of a dim mysterious shore. <br />
  A sailor on the Inconscient&#8217;s fathomless sea, <br />
  He voyages through a starry world of thought <br />
  On Matter&#8217;s deck to a spiritual sun. <br />
  Across the noise and multitudinous cry, <br />
  Across the rapt unknowable silences, <br />
  Through a strange mid-world under supernal skies, <br />
  Beyond earth&#8217;s longitudes and latitudes, <br />
  His goal is fixed outside all present maps. <br />
  But none learns whither through the unknown he sails <br />
  Or what secret mission the great Mother gave. <br />
  In the hidden strength of her omnipotent Will, <br />
  Driven by her breath across life&#8217;s tossing deep,</p>

<p>Through the thunder&#8217;s roar and through the windless hush, <br />
  Through fog and mist where nothing more is seen, <br />
  He carries her sealed orders in his breast. <br />
  Late will he know, opening the mystic script, <br />
  Whether to a blank port in the Unseen <br />
  He goes or, armed with her fiat, to discover <br />
  A new mind and body in the city of God <br />
  And enshrine the Immortal in his glory&#8217;s house <br />
  And make the finite one with Infinity. <br />
  Across the salt waste of the endless years <br />
  Her ocean winds impel his errant boat, <br />
  The cosmic waters plashing as he goes, <br />
  A rumour around him and danger and a call. <br />
  Always he follows in her force&#8217;s wake. <br />
  He sails through life and death and other life, <br />
  He travels on through waking and through sleep. <br />
  A power is on him from her occult force <br />
  That ties him to his own creation&#8217;s fate, <br />
  And never can the mighty Traveller rest <br />
  And never can the mystic voyage cease <br />
  Till the nescient dusk is lifted from man&#8217;s soul <br />
  And the morns of God have overtaken his night. <br />
  As long as Nature lasts, he too is there, <br />
  For this is sure that he and she are one; <br />
  Even when he sleeps, he keeps her on his breast: <br />
  Whoever leaves her, he will not depart <br />
  To repose without her in the Unknowable. <br />
  There is a truth to know, a work to do; <br />
  Her play is real; a Mystery he fulfils: <br />
  There is a plan in the Mother&#8217;s deep world-whim, <br />
  A purpose in her vast and random game. <br />
  This ever she meant since the first dawn of life, <br />
  This constant will she covered with her sport, <br />
  To evoke a Person in the impersonal Void, <br />
  With the Truth-Light strike earth&#8217;s massive roots of trance, <br />
  Wake a dumb self in the inconscient depths</p>

  That the eyes of the Timeless might look out from Time <br />

  And laid on the spirit the burden of the flesh, <br />
  That Godhead&#8217;s seed might flower in mindless Space.</td>
