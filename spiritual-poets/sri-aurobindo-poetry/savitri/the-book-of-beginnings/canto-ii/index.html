<p>Awhile, withdrawn in secret fields of thought, <br />
  Her mind moved in a many-imaged past <br />
  That lived again and saw its end approach: <br />
  Dying, it lived imperishably in her; <br />
  Transient and vanishing from transient eyes, <br />
  Invisible, a fateful ghost of self, <br />
  It bore the future on its phantom breast. <br />
  Along the fleeting event&#8217;s far-backward trail <br />
  Regressed the stream of the insistent hours, <br />
  And on the bank of the mysterious flood <br />
  Peopled with well-loved forms now seen no more <br />
  And the subtle images of things that were, <br />
  Her witness spirit stood reviewing Time. <br />
  All that she once had hoped and dreamed and been, <br />
  Flew past her eagle-winged through memory&#8217;s skies. <br />
  As in a many-hued flaming inner dawn, <br />
  Her life&#8217;s broad highways and its sweet bypaths <br />
  Lay mapped to her sun-clear recording view, <br />
  From the bright country of her childhood&#8217;s days <br />
  And the blue mountains of her soaring youth <br />
  And the paradise groves and peacock wings of Love <br />
  To joy clutched under the silent shadow of doom <br />
  In a last turn where heaven raced with hell. <br />
  Twelve passionate months led in a day of fate. <br />
  An absolute supernatural darkness falls <br />
  On man sometimes when he draws near to God: <br />
  An hour arrives when fail all Nature&#8217;s means; <br />
  Forced out from the protecting Ignorance <br />
  And flung back on his naked primal need, <br />
  He at length must cast from him his surface soul <br />
  And be the ungarbed entity within:</p>

<p>That hour had fallen now on Savitri. <br />
  A point she had reached where life must be in vain <br />
  Or, in her unborn element awake, <br />
  Her will must cancel her body&#8217;s destiny. <br />
  For only the unborn spirit&#8217;s timeless power <br />
  Can lift the yoke imposed by birth in Time. <br />
  Only the Self that builds this figure of self <br />
  Can rase the fixed interminable line <br />
  That joins these changing names, these numberless lives, <br />
  These new oblivious personalities <br />
  And keeps still lurking in our conscious acts <br />
  The trail of old forgotten thoughts and deeds, <br />
  Disown the legacy of our buried selves, <br />
  The burdensome heirship to our vanished forms <br />
  Accepted blindly by the body and soul. <br />
  An episode in an unremembered tale, <br />
  Its beginning lost, its motive and plot concealed, <br />
  A once living story has prepared and made <br />
  Our present fate, child of past energies. <br />
  The fixity of the cosmic sequences <br />
  Fastened with hidden inevitable links <br />
  She must disrupt, dislodge by her soul&#8217;s force <br />
  Her past, a block on the Immortal&#8217;s road, <br />
  Make a rased ground and shape anew her fate. <br />
  A colloquy of the original Gods <br />
  Meeting upon the borders of the unknown, <br />
  Her soul&#8217;s debate with embodied Nothingness <br />
  Must be wrestled out on a dangerous dim background: <br />
  Her being must confront its formless Cause, <br />
  Against the universe weigh its single self. <br />
  On the bare peak where Self is alone with Nought <br />
  And life has no sense and love no place to stand, <br />
  She must plead her case upon extinction&#8217;s verge, <br />
  In the world&#8217;s death-cave uphold life&#8217;s helpless claim <br />
  And vindicate her right to be and love. <br />
  Altered must be Nature&#8217;s harsh economy;</p>

<p>Acquittance she must win from her past&#8217;s bond, <br />
  An old account of suffering exhaust, <br />
  Strike out from Time the soul&#8217;s long compound debt <br />
  And the heavy servitudes of the Karmic Gods, <br />
  The slow revenge of unforgiving Law <br />
  And the deep need of universal pain <br />
  And hard sacrifice and tragic consequence. <br />
  Out of a timeless barrier she must break, <br />
  Penetrate with her thinking depths the Void&#8217;s monstrous hush, <br />
  Look into the lonely eyes of immortal Death <br />
  And with her nude spirit measure the Infinite&#8217;s night. <br />
  The great and dolorous moment now was close. <br />
  A mailed battalion marching to its doom, <br />
  The last long days went by with heavy tramp, <br />
  Long but too soon to pass, too near the end. <br />
  Alone amid the many faces loved, <br />
  Aware among unknowing happy hearts, <br />
  Her armoured spirit kept watch upon the hours <br />
  Listening for a foreseen tremendous step <br />
  In the closed beauty of the inhuman wilds. <br />
  A combatant in silent dreadful lists, <br />
  The world unknowing, for the world she stood: <br />
  No helper had she save the Strength within; <br />
  There was no witness of terrestrial eyes; <br />
  The Gods above and Nature sole below <br />
  Were the spectators of that mighty strife. <br />
  Around her were the austere sky-pointing hills, <br />
  And the green murmurous broad deep-thoughted woods <br />
  Muttered incessantly their muffled spell. <br />
  A dense magnificent coloured self-wrapped life <br />
  Draped in the leaves&#8217; vivid emerald monotone <br />
  And set with chequered sunbeams and blithe flowers <br />
  Immured her destiny&#8217;s secluded scene. <br />
  There had she grown to the stature of her spirit: <br />
  The genius of titanic silences <br />
  Steeping her soul in its wide loneliness</p>

<p>Had shown to her her self&#8217;s bare reality <br />
  And mated her with her environment. <br />
  Its solitude greatened her human hours <br />
  With a background of the eternal and unique. <br />
  A force of spare direct necessity <br />
  Reduced the heavy framework of man&#8217;s days <br />
  And his overburdening mass of outward needs <br />
  To a first thin strip of simple animal wants, <br />
  And the mighty wildness of the primitive earth <br />
  And the brooding multitude of patient trees <br />
  And the musing sapphire leisure of the sky <br />
  And the solemn weight of the slowly-passing months <br />
  Had left in her deep room for thought and God. <br />
  There was her drama&#8217;s radiant prologue lived. <br />
  A spot for the eternal&#8217;s tread on earth <br />
  Set in the cloistral yearning of the woods <br />
  And watched by the aspiration of the peaks <br />
  Appeared through an aureate opening in Time, <br />
  Where stillness listening felt the unspoken word <br />
  And the hours forgot to pass towards grief and change. <br />
  Here with the suddenness divine advents have, <br />
  Repeating the marvel of the first descent, <br />
  Changing to rapture the dull earthly round, <br />
  Love came to her hiding the shadow, Death. <br />
  Well might he find in her his perfect shrine. <br />
  Since first the earth-being&#8217;s heavenward growth began, <br />
  Through all the long ordeal of the race, <br />
  Never a rarer creature bore his shaft, <br />
  That burning test of the godhead in our parts, <br />
  A lightning from the heights on our abyss. <br />
  All in her pointed to a nobler kind. <br />
  Near to earth&#8217;s wideness, intimate with heaven, <br />
  Exalted and swift her young large-visioned spirit <br />
  Voyaging through worlds of splendour and of calm <br />
  Overflew the ways of Thought to unborn things. <br />
  Ardent was her self-poised unstumbling will;</p>

<p>Her mind, a sea of white sincerity, <br />
  Passionate in flow, had not one turbid wave. <br />
  As in a mystic and dynamic dance <br />
  A priestess of immaculate ecstasies <br />
  Inspired and ruled from Truth&#8217;s revealing vault <br />
  Moves in some prophet cavern of the gods, <br />
  A heart of silence in the hands of joy <br />
  Inhabited with rich creative beats <br />
  A body like a parable of dawn <br />
  That seemed a niche for veiled divinity <br />
  Or golden temple-door to things beyond. <br />
  Immortal rhythms swayed in her time-born steps; <br />
  Her look, her smile awoke celestial sense <br />
  Even in earth-stuff, and their intense delight <br />
  Poured a supernal beauty on men&#8217;s lives. <br />
  A wide self-giving was her native act; <br />
  A magnanimity as of sea or sky <br />
  Enveloped with its greatness all that came <br />
  And gave a sense as of a greatened world: <br />
  Her kindly care was a sweet temperate sun, <br />
  Her high passion a blue heaven&#8217;s equipoise. <br />
  As might a soul fly like a hunted bird, <br />
  Escaping with tired wings from a world of storms, <br />
  And a quiet reach like a remembered breast, <br />
  In a haven of safety and splendid soft repose <br />
  One could drink life back in streams of honey-fire, <br />
  Recover the lost habit of happiness, <br />
  Feel her bright nature&#8217;s glorious ambience, <br />
  And preen joy in her warmth and colour&#8217;s rule. <br />
  A deep of compassion, a hushed sanctuary, <br />
  Her inward help unbarred a gate in heaven; <br />
  Love in her was wider than the universe, <br />
  The whole world could take refuge in her single heart. <br />
  The great unsatisfied godhead here could dwell: <br />
  Vacant of the dwarf self&#8217;s imprisoned air, <br />
  Her mood could harbour his sublimer breath</p>

  For even her gulfs were secrecies of light. <br />
  At once she was the stillness and the word, <br />
  A continent of self-diffusing peace, <br />
  An ocean of untrembling virgin fire; <br />
  The strength, the silence of the gods were hers. <br />
  In her he found a vastness like his own, <br />
  His high warm subtle ether he refound <br />
  And moved in her as in his natural home. <br />
  In her he met his own eternity. </p>
<p>Till then no mournful line had barred this ray. <br />
  On the frail breast of this precarious earth, <br />
  Since her orbed sight in its breath-fastened house, <br />
  Opening in sympathy with happier stars <br />
  Where life is not exposed to sorrowful change, <br />
  Remembered beauty death-claimed lids ignore <br />
  And wondered at this world of fragile forms <br />
  Carried on canvas-strips of shimmering Time, <br />
  The impunity of unborn Mights was hers. <br />
  Although she leaned to bear the human load, <br />
  Her walk kept still the measures of the gods. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s breath had failed to stain that brilliant glass: <br />
  Unsmeared with the dust of our mortal atmosphere <br />
  It still reflected heaven&#8217;s spiritual joy. <br />
  Almost they saw who lived within her light <br />
  Her playmate in the sempiternal spheres <br />
  Descended from its unattainable realms <br />
  In her attracting advent&#8217;s luminous wake, <br />
  The white-fire dragon-bird of endless bliss <br />
  Drifting with burning wings above her days: <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s tranquil shield guarded the missioned child. <br />
  A glowing orbit was her early term, <br />
  Years like gold raiment of the gods that pass; <br />
  Her youth sat throned in calm felicity. <br />
  But joy cannot endure until the end:</p>

<p>There is a darkness in terrestrial things <br />
  That will not suffer long too glad a note. <br />
  On her too closed the inescapable Hand: <br />
  The armed Immortal bore the snare of Time. <br />
  One dealt with her who meets the burdened great. <br />
  Assigner of the ordeal and the path <br />
  Who chooses in this holocaust of the soul <br />
  Death, fall and sorrow as the spirit&#8217;s goads, <br />
  The dubious godhead with his torch of pain <br />
  Lit up the chasm of the unfinished world <br />
  And called her to fill with her vast self the abyss. <br />
  August and pitiless in his calm outlook, <br />
  Heightening the Eternal&#8217;s dreadful strategy, <br />
  He measured the difficulty with the might <br />
  And dug more deep the gulf that all must cross. <br />
  Assailing her divinest elements, <br />
  He made her heart kin to the striving human heart <br />
  And forced her strength to its appointed road. <br />
  For this she had accepted mortal breath; <br />
  To wrestle with the Shadow she had come <br />
  And must confront the riddle of man&#8217;s birth <br />
  And life&#8217;s brief struggle in dumb Matter&#8217;s night. <br />
  Whether to bear with Ignorance and death <br />
  Or hew the ways of Immortality, <br />
  To win or lose the godlike game for man, <br />
  Was her soul&#8217;s issue thrown with Destiny&#8217;s dice. <br />
  But not to submit and suffer was she born; <br />
  To lead, to deliver was her glorious part. <br />
  Here was no fabric of terrestrial make <br />
  Fit for a day&#8217;s use by busy careless Powers. <br />
  An image fluttering on the screen of Fate, <br />
  Half-animated for a passing show, <br />
  Or a castaway on the ocean of Desire <br />
  Flung to the eddies in a ruthless sport <br />
  And tossed along the gulfs of Circumstance, <br />
  A creature born to bend beneath the yoke,</p>

<p>A chattel and a plaything of Time&#8217;s lords, <br />
  Or one more pawn who comes destined to be pushed <br />
  One slow move forward on a measureless board <br />
  In the chess-play of the earth-soul with Doom,&#8211; <br />
  Such is the human figure drawn by Time. <br />
  A conscious frame was here, a self-born Force. <br />
  In this enigma of the dusk of God, <br />
  This slow and strange uneasy compromise <br />
  Of limiting Nature with a limitless Soul, <br />
  Where all must move between an ordered Chance <br />
  And an uncaring blind Necessity, <br />
  Too high the fire spiritual dare not blaze. <br />
  If once it met the intense original Flame, <br />
  An answering touch might shatter all measures made <br />
  And earth sink down with the weight of the Infinite. <br />
  A gaol is this immense material world: <br />
  Across each road stands armed a stone-eyed Law, <br />
  At every gate the huge dim sentinels pace. <br />
  A grey tribunal of the Ignorance, <br />
  An Inquisition of the priests of Night <br />
  In judgment sit on the adventurer soul, <br />
  And the dual tables and the Karmic norm <br />
  Restrain the Titan in us and the God: <br />
  Pain with its lash, joy with its silver bribe <br />
  Guard the Wheel&#8217;s circling immobility. <br />
  A bond is put on the high-climbing mind, <br />
  A seal on the too large wide-open heart; <br />
  Death stays the journeying discoverer, Life. <br />
  Thus is the throne of the Inconscient safe <br />
  While the tardy coilings of the aeons pass <br />
  And the Animal browses in the sacred fence <br />
  And the gold Hawk can cross the skies no more. <br />
  But one stood up and lit the limitless flame. <br />
  Arraigned by the dark Power that hates all bliss <br />
  In the dire court where life must pay for joy, <br />
  Sentenced by the mechanic justicer</p>

<p>To the afflicting penalty of man&#8217;s hopes, <br />
  Her head she bowed not to the stark decree <br />
  Baring her helpless heart to destiny&#8217;s stroke. <br />
  So bows and must the mind-born will in man <br />
  Obedient to the statutes fixed of old, <br />
  Admitting without appeal the nether gods. <br />
  In her the superhuman cast its seed. <br />
  Inapt to fold its mighty wings of dream <br />
  Her spirit refused to hug the common soil, <br />
  Or, finding all life&#8217;s golden meanings robbed, <br />
  Compound with earth, struck from the starry list, <br />
  Or quench with black despair the God-given light. <br />
  Accustomed to the eternal and the true, <br />
  Her being conscious of its divine founts <br />
  Asked not from mortal frailty pain&#8217;s relief, <br />
  Patched not with failure bargain or compromise. <br />
  A work she had to do, a word to speak: <br />
  Writing the unfinished story of her soul <br />
  In thoughts and actions graved in Nature&#8217;s book, <br />
  She accepted not to close the luminous page, <br />
  Cancel her commerce with eternity, <br />
  Or set a signature of weak assent <br />
  To the brute balance of the world&#8217;s exchange. <br />
  A force in her that toiled since earth was made, <br />
  Accomplishing in life the great world-plan, <br />
  Pursuing after death immortal aims, <br />
  Repugned to admit frustration&#8217;s barren role, <br />
  Forfeit the meaning of her birth in Time, <br />
  Obey the government of the casual fact <br />
  Or yield her high destiny up to passing Chance. <br />
  In her own self she found her high recourse; <br />
  She matched with the iron law her sovereign right: <br />
  Her single will opposed the cosmic rule. <br />
  To stay the wheels of Doom this greatness rose. <br />
  At the Unseen&#8217;s knock upon her hidden gates <br />
  Her strength made greater by the lightning&#8217;s touch</p>

<p>Awoke from slumber in her heart&#8217;s recess. <br />
  It bore the stroke of That which kills and saves. <br />
  Across the awful march no eye can see, <br />
  Barring its dreadful route no will can change, <br />
  She faced the engines of the universe; <br />
  A heart stood in the way of the driving wheels: <br />
  Its giant workings paused in front of a mind, <br />
  Its stark conventions met the flame of a soul. <br />
  A magic leverage suddenly is caught <br />
  That moves the veiled Ineffable&#8217;s timeless will: <br />
  A prayer, a master act, a king idea <br />
  Can link man&#8217;s strength to a transcendent Force. <br />
  Then miracle is made the common rule, <br />
  One mighty deed can change the course of things; <br />
  A lonely thought becomes omnipotent. <br />
  All now seems Nature&#8217;s massed machinery; <br />
  An endless servitude to material rule <br />
  And long determination&#8217;s rigid chain, <br />
  Her firm and changeless habits aping Law, <br />
  Her empire of unconscious deft device <br />
  Annul the claim of man&#8217;s free human will. <br />
  He too is a machine amid machines; <br />
  A piston brain pumps out the shapes of thought, <br />
  A beating heart cuts out emotion&#8217;s modes; <br />
  An insentient energy fabricates a soul. <br />
  Or the figure of the world reveals the signs <br />
  Of a tied Chance repeating her old steps <br />
  In circles around Matter&#8217;s binding-posts. <br />
  A random series of inept events <br />
  To which reason lends illusive sense, is here, <br />
  Or the empiric Life&#8217;s instinctive search, <br />
  Or a vast ignorant mind&#8217;s colossal work. <br />
  But wisdom comes, and vision grows within: <br />
  Then Nature&#8217;s instrument crowns himself her king; <br />
  He feels his witnessing self and conscious power; <br />
  His soul steps back and sees the Light supreme.</p>
