<p>A world&#8217;s desire compelled her mortal birth. <br />
  One in the front of the immemorial quest, <br />
  Protagonist of the mysterious play <br />
  In which the Unknown pursues himself through forms <br />
  And limits his eternity by the hours <br />
  And the blind Void struggles to live and see, <br />
  A thinker and toiler in the ideal&#8217;s air, <br />
  Brought down to earth&#8217;s dumb need her radiant power. <br />
  His was a spirit that stooped from larger spheres <br />
  Into our province of ephemeral sight, <br />
  A colonist from immortality. <br />
  A pointing beam on earth&#8217;s uncertain roads, <br />
  His birth held up a symbol and a sign; <br />
  His human self like a translucent cloak <br />
  Covered the All-Wise who leads the unseeing world. <br />
  Affiliated to cosmic Space and Time <br />
  And paying here God&#8217;s debt to earth and man <br />
  A greater sonship was his divine right. <br />
  Although consenting to mortal ignorance, <br />
  His knowledge shared the Light ineffable. <br />
  A strength of the original Permanence <br />
  Entangled in the moment and its flow, <br />
  He kept the vision of the Vasts behind: <br />
  A power was in him from the Unknowable. <br />
  An archivist of the symbols of the Beyond, <br />
  A treasurer of superhuman dreams, <br />
  He bore the stamp of mighty memories <br />
  And shed their grandiose ray on human life. <br />
  His days were a long growth to the Supreme. <br />
  A skyward being nourishing its roots</p>

<p>On sustenance from occult spiritual founts <br />
  Climbed through white rays to meet an unseen Sun. <br />
  His soul lived as eternity&#8217;s delegate, <br />
  His mind was like a fire assailing heaven, <br />
  His will a hunter in the trails of light. <br />
  An ocean impulse lifted every breath; <br />
  Each action left the footprints of a god, <br />
  Each moment was a beat of puissant wings. <br />
  The little plot of our mortality <br />
  Touched by this tenant from the heights became <br />
  A playground of the living Infinite. <br />
  This bodily appearance is not all; <br />
  The form deceives, the person is a mask; <br />
  Hid deep in man celestial powers can dwell. <br />
  His fragile ship conveys through the sea of years <br />
  An incognito of the Imperishable. <br />
  A spirit that is a flame of God abides, <br />
  A fiery portion of the Wonderful, <br />
  Artist of his own beauty and delight, <br />
  Immortal in our mortal poverty. <br />
  This sculptor of the forms of the Infinite, <br />
  This screened unrecognised Inhabitant, <br />
  Initiate of his own veiled mysteries, <br />
  Hides in a small dumb seed his cosmic thought. <br />
  In the mute strength of the occult Idea <br />
  Determining predestined shape and act, <br />
  Passenger from life to life, from scale to scale, <br />
  Changing his imaged self from form to form, <br />
  He regards the icon growing by his gaze <br />
  And in the worm foresees the coming god. <br />
  At last the traveller in the paths of Time <br />
  Arrives on the frontiers of eternity. <br />
  In the transient symbol of humanity draped, <br />
  He feels his substance of undying self <br />
  And loses his kinship to mortality. <br />
  A beam of the Eternal smites his heart,</p>

<p>His thought stretches into infinitude; <br />
  All in him turns to spirit vastnesses. <br />
  His soul breaks out to join the Oversoul, <br />
  His life is oceaned by that superlife. <br />
  He has drunk from the breasts of the Mother of the worlds; <br />
  A topless Supernature fills his frame: <br />
  She adopts his spirit&#8217;s everlasting ground <br />
  As the security of her changing world <br />
  And shapes the figure of her unborn mights. <br />
  Immortally she conceives herself in him, <br />
  In the creature the unveiled Creatrix works: <br />
  Her face is seen through his face, her eyes through his eyes; <br />
  Her being is his through a vast identity. <br />
  Then is revealed in man the overt Divine. <br />
  A static Oneness and dynamic Power <br />
  Descend in him, the integral Godhead&#8217;s seals; <br />
  His soul and body take that splendid stamp. <br />
  A long dim preparation is man&#8217;s life, <br />
  A circle of toil and hope and war and peace <br />
  Tracked out by Life on Matter&#8217;s obscure ground. <br />
  In his climb to a peak no feet have ever trod, <br />
  He seeks through a penumbra shot with flame <br />
  A veiled reality half-known, ever missed, <br />
  A search for something or someone never found, <br />
  Cult of an ideal never made real here, <br />
  An endless spiral of ascent and fall <br />
  Until at last is reached the giant point <br />
  Through which his Glory shines for whom we were made <br />
  And we break into the infinity of God. <br />
  Across our nature&#8217;s border line we escape <br />
  Into Supernature&#8217;s arc of living light. <br />
  This now was witnessed in that son of Force; <br />
  In him that high transition laid its base. <br />
  Original and supernal Immanence <br />
  Of which all Nature&#8217;s process is the art, <br />
  The cosmic Worker set his secret hand</p>

<p>To turn this frail mud-engine to heaven-use. <br />
  A Presence wrought behind the ambiguous screen: <br />
  It beat his soil to bear a Titan&#8217;s weight, <br />
  Refining half-hewn blocks of natural strength <br />
  It built his soul into a statued god. <br />
  The Craftsman of the magic stuff of self <br />
  Who labours at his high and difficult plan <br />
  In the wide workshop of the wonderful world, <br />
  Modelled in inward Time his rhythmic parts. <br />
  Then came the abrupt transcendent miracle: <br />
  The masked immaculate Grandeur could outline, <br />
  At travail in the occult womb of life, <br />
  His dreamed magnificence of things to be. <br />
  A crown of the architecture of the worlds, <br />
  A mystery of married Earth and Heaven <br />
  Annexed divinity to the mortal scheme. <br />
  A Seer was born, a shining Guest of Time. <br />
  For him mind&#8217;s limiting firmament ceased above. <br />
  In the griffin forefront of the Night and Day <br />
  A gap was rent in the all-concealing vault; <br />
  The conscious ends of being went rolling back: <br />
  The landmarks of the little person fell, <br />
  The island ego joined its continent. <br />
  Overpassed was this world of rigid limiting forms: <br />
  Life&#8217;s barriers opened into the Unknown. <br />
  Abolished were conception&#8217;s covenants <br />
  And, striking off subjection&#8217;s rigorous clause, <br />
  Annulled the soul&#8217;s treaty with Nature&#8217;s nescience. <br />
  All the grey inhibitions were torn off <br />
  And broken the intellect&#8217;s hard and lustrous lid; <br />
  Truth unpartitioned found immense sky-room; <br />
  An empyrean vision saw and knew; <br />
  The bounded mind became a boundless light, <br />
  The finite self mated with infinity. <br />
  His march now soared into an eagle&#8217;s flight. <br />
  Out of apprenticeship to Ignorance</p>

  And made him an archmason of the soul, <br />
  A builder of the Immortal&#8217;s secret house, <br />
  An aspirant to supernal Timelessness: <br />
  Freedom and empire called to him from on high; <br />
  Above mind&#8217;s twilight and life&#8217;s star-led night <br />
  There gleamed the dawn of a spiritual day. </p>
<p>As so he grew into his larger self, <br />
  Humanity framed his movements less and less; <br />
  A greater being saw a greater world. <br />
  A fearless will for knowledge dared to erase <br />
  The lines of safety Reason draws that bar <br />
  Mind&#8217;s soar, soul&#8217;s dive into the Infinite. <br />
  Even his first steps broke our small earth-bounds <br />
  And loitered in a vaster freer air.&nbsp; <br />
  In hands sustained by a transfiguring Might <br />
  He caught up lightly like a giant&#8217;s bow <br />
  Left slumbering in a sealed and secret cave <br />
  The powers that sleep unused in man within.&nbsp; <br />
  He made of miracle a normal act <br />
  And turned to a common part of divine works,&nbsp; <br />
  Magnificently natural at this height,&nbsp; <br />
  Efforts that would shatter the strength of mortal hearts, <br />
  Pursued in a royalty of mighty ease <br />
  Aims too sublime for Nature&#8217;s daily will:&nbsp; <br />
  The gifts of the spirit crowding came to him;&nbsp; <br />
  They were his life&#8217;s pattern and his privilege.&nbsp; <br />
  A pure perception lent its lucent joy: <br />
  Its intimate vision waited not to think; <br />
  It enveloped all Nature in a single glance, <br />
  It looked into the very self of things; <br />
  Deceived no more by form he saw the soul. <br />
  In beings it knew what lurked to them unknown; <br />
  It seized the idea in mind, the wish in the heart; <br />
  It plucked out from grey folds of secrecy</p>

  Invade him with their happiness and their grief; <br />
  Their love, their anger, their unspoken hopes <br />
  Entered in currents or in pouring waves <br />
  Into the immobile ocean of his calm. <br />
  He heard the inspired sound of his own thoughts <br />
  Re-echoed in the vault of other minds; <br />

  His inner self grew near to others&#8217; selves <br />
  And bore a kinship&#8217;s weight, a common tie, <br />
  Yet stood untouched, king of itself, alone. <br />
  A magical accord quickened and attuned <br />
  To ethereal symphonies the old earthy strings; <br />
  It raised the servitors of mind and life <br />
  To be happy partners in the soul&#8217;s response, <br />
  Tissue and nerve were turned to sensitive chords, <br />
  Records of lustre and ecstasy; it made <br />
  The body&#8217;s means the spirit&#8217;s acolytes. <br />
  A heavenlier function with a finer mode <br />
  Lit with its grace man&#8217;s outward earthliness; <br />
  The soul&#8217;s experience of its deeper sheaths <br />
  No more slept drugged by Matter&#8217;s dominance. <br />
  In the dead wall closing us from wider self, <br />
  Into a secrecy of apparent sleep, <br />
  The mystic tract beyond our waking thoughts, <br />
  A door parted, built in by Matter&#8217;s force, <br />
  Releasing things unseized by earthly sense: <br />
  A world unseen, unknown by outward mind <br />
  Appeared in the silent spaces of the soul. <br />
  He sat in secret chambers looking out <br />
  Into the luminous countries of the unborn <br />
  Where all things dreamed by the mind are seen and true <br />
  And all that the life longs for is drawn close. <br />
  He saw the Perfect in their starry homes <br />
  Wearing the glory of a deathless form,</p>

  Rapt in the heart-beats of God-ecstasy. <br />
  He lived in the mystic space where thought is born <br />
  And will is nursed by an ethereal Power <br />
  And fed on the white milk of the Eternal&#8217;s strengths <br />
  Till it grows into the likeness of a god. <br />
  In the Witness&#8217;s occult rooms with mind-built walls <br />
  On hidden interiors, lurking passages <br />
  Opened the windows of the inner sight. <br />
  He owned the house of undivided Time. <br />
  Lifting the heavy curtain of the flesh <br />
  He stood upon a threshold serpent-watched, <br />
  And peered into gleaming endless corridors, <br />
  Silent and listening in the silent heart <br />
  For the coming of the new and the unknown. <br />
  He gazed across the empty stillnesses <br />
  And heard the footsteps of the undreamed Idea <br />
  In the far avenues of the Beyond. <br />
  He heard the secret Voice, the Word that knows, <br />
  And saw the secret face that is our own. <br />
  The inner planes uncovered their crystal doors; <br />
  Strange powers and influences touched his life. <br />
  A vision came of higher realms than ours, <br />
  A consciousness of brighter fields and skies, <br />
  Of beings less circumscribed than brief-lived men <br />
  And subtler bodies than these passing frames, <br />
  Objects too fine for our material grasp, <br />
  Acts vibrant with a superhuman light <br />
  And movements pushed by a superconscient force, <br />
  And joys that never flowed through mortal limbs, <br />
  And lovelier scenes than earth&#8217;s and happier lives. <br />
  A consciousness of beauty and of bliss, <br />
  A knowledge which became what it perceived, <br />
  Replaced the separated sense and heart <br />
  And drew all Nature into its embrace. <br />
  The mind leaned out to meet the hidden worlds:</p>

  In the nostrils quivered celestial fragrances, <br />
  On the tongue lingered the honey of paradise. <br />
  A channel of universal harmony, <br />
  Hearing was a stream of magic audience, <br />
  A bed for occult sounds earth cannot hear. <br />
  Out of a covert tract of slumber self <br />
  The voice came of a truth submerged, unknown <br />
  That flows beneath the cosmic surfaces, <br />
  Only mid an omniscient silence heard, <br />
  Held by intuitive heart and secret sense. <br />
  It caught the burden of secrecies sealed and dumb, <br />
  It voiced the unfulfilled demand of earth <br />
  And the song of promise of unrealised heavens <br />
  And all that hides in an omnipotent Sleep. <br />
  In the unceasing drama carried by Time <br />
  On its long listening flood that bears the world&#8217;s <br />
  Insoluble doubt on a pilgrimage without goal, <br />
  A laughter of sleepless pleasure foamed and spumed <br />
  And murmurings of desire that cannot die: <br />
  A cry came of the world&#8217;s delight to be, <br />
  The grandeur and greatness of its will to live, <br />
  Recall of the soul&#8217;s adventure into space, <br />
  A traveller through the magic centuries <br />
  And being&#8217;s labour in Matter&#8217;s universe, <br />
  Its search for the mystic meaning of its birth <br />
  And joy of high spiritual response, <br />
  Its throb of satisfaction and content <br />
  In all the sweetness of the gifts of life, <br />
  Its large breath and pulse and thrill of hope and fear, <br />
  Its taste of pangs and tears and ecstasy, <br />
  Its rapture&#8217;s poignant beat of sudden bliss, <br />
  The sob of its passion and unending pain. <br />
  The murmur and whisper of the unheard sounds <br />
  Which crowd around our hearts but find no window <br />
  To enter, swelled into a canticle</p>

<p>Of all that suffers to be still unknown <br />
  And all that labours vainly to be born <br />
  And all the sweetness none will ever taste <br />
  And all the beauty that will never be. <br />
  Inaudible to our deaf mortal ears <br />
  The wide world-rhythms wove their stupendous chant <br />
  To which life strives to fit our rhyme-beats here, <br />
  Melting our limits in the illimitable, <br />
  Tuning the finite to infinity. <br />
  A low muttering rose from the subconscient caves, <br />
  The stammer of the primal ignorance; <br />
  Answer to that inarticulate questioning, <br />
  There stooped with lightning neck and thunder&#8217;s wings <br />
  A radiant hymn to the Inexpressible <br />
  And the anthem of the superconscient light. <br />
  All was revealed there none can here express; <br />
  Vision and dream were fables spoken by truth <br />
  Or symbols more veridical than fact, <br />
  Or were truths enforced by supernatural seals. <br />
  Immortal eyes approached and looked in his, <br />
  And beings of many kingdoms neared and spoke: <br />
  The ever-living whom we name as dead <br />
  Could leave their glory beyond death and birth <br />
  To utter the wisdom which exceeds all phrase: <br />
  The kings of evil and the kings of good, <br />
  Appellants at the reason&#8217;s judgment seat, <br />
  Proclaimed the gospel of their opposites, <br />
  And all believed themselves spokesmen of God: <br />
  The gods of light and titans of the dark <br />
  Battled for his soul as for a costly prize. <br />
  In every hour loosed from the quiver of Time <br />
  There rose a song of new discovery, <br />
  A bow-twang&#8217;s hum of young experiment. <br />
  Each day was a spiritual romance, <br />
  As if he was born into a bright new world; <br />
  Adventure leaped an unexpected friend,</p>

  Each happening was a deep experience. <br />
  There were high encounters, epic colloquies, <br />
  And counsels came couched in celestial speech, <br />
  And honeyed pleadings breathed from occult lips <br />
  To help the heart to yield to rapture&#8217;s call, <br />
  And sweet temptations stole from beauty&#8217;s realms <br />
  And sudden ecstasies from a world of bliss. <br />

  And passed the zone where thought replaces life. <br />
  Out of this world of signs suddenly he came <br />
  Into a silent self where world was not <br />
  And looked beyond into a nameless vast. <br />
  These symbol figures lost their right to live, <br />
  All tokens dropped our sense can recognise; <br />
  There the heart beat no more at body&#8217;s touch, <br />
  There the eyes gazed no more on beauty&#8217;s shape. <br />
  In rare and lucent intervals of hush <br />
  Into a signless region he could soar <br />
  Packed with the deep contents of formlessness <br />
  Where world was into a single being rapt <br />
  And all was known by the light of identity <br />
  And Spirit was its own self-evidence. <br />
  The Supreme&#8217;s gaze looked out through human eyes <br />
  And saw all things and creatures as itself <br />
  And knew all thought and word as its own voice. <br />

  And oneness is the soul of multitude. <br />

  And all ideas rejoin Reality. <br />
  There knowing herself by her own termless self, <br />
  Wisdom supernal, wordless, absolute <br />
  Sat uncompanioned in the eternal Calm, <br />
  All-seeing, motionless, sovereign and alone. <br />

  Idea, seeking a house in boundlessness, <br />
  Weary of its homeless immortality, <br />
  Asks not in thought&#8217;s carved brilliant cell to rest <br />
  Whose single window&#8217;s clipped outlook on things <br />
  Sees only a little arc of God&#8217;s vast sky. <br />
  The boundless with the boundless there consorts; <br />

  Into a living that surpasses life, <br />

  The voice that only by speech can move the mind <br />
  Became a silent knowledge in the soul; <br />
  The strength that only in action feels its truth <br />
  Was lodged now in a mute omnipotent peace. <br />
  A leisure in the labour of the worlds, <br />
  A pause in the joy and anguish of the search <br />
  Restored the stress of Nature to God&#8217;s calm. <br />
  A vast unanimity ended life&#8217;s debate. <br />
  The war of thoughts that fathers the universe, <br />
  The clash of forces struggling to prevail <br />
  In the tremendous shock that lights a star <br />

  And, curtained by the darkness, does his work, <br />
  A subtle and all-knowing guest and guide, <br />
  Till they too feel the need and will to change. <br />
  All here must learn to obey a higher law, <br />
  Our body&#8217;s cells must hold the Immortal&#8217;s flame. <br />

  His greater consciousness withdrew behind; <br />

<p>Made whole the fragment-being we are here. <br />
  At last was won a firm spiritual poise, <br />
  A constant lodging in the Eternal&#8217;s realm, <br />
  A safety in the Silence and the Ray, <br />
  A settlement in the Immutable. <br />
  His heights of being lived in the still Self; <br />
  His mind could rest on a supernal ground <br />
  And look down on the magic and the play <br />
  Where the God-child lies on the lap of Night and Dawn <br />
  And the Everlasting puts on Time&#8217;s disguise. <br />
  To the still heights and to the troubled depths <br />
  His equal spirit gave its vast assent: <br />
  A poised serenity of tranquil strength, <br />
  A wide unshaken look on Time&#8217;s unrest <br />
  Faced all experience with unaltered peace. <br />
  Indifferent to the sorrow and delight, <br />
  Untempted by the marvel and the call, <br />
  Immobile it beheld the flux of things, <br />
  Calm and apart supported all that is: <br />
  His spirit&#8217;s stillness helped the toiling world. <br />
  Inspired by silence and the closed eyes&#8217; sight <br />
  His force could work with a new luminous art <br />
  On the crude material from which all is made <br />
  And the refusal of Inertia&#8217;s mass <br />
  And the grey front of the world&#8217;s Ignorance <br />
  And nescient Matter and the huge error of life. <br />
  As a sculptor chisels a deity out of stone <br />
  He slowly chipped off the dark envelope, <br />
  Line of defence of Nature&#8217;s ignorance, <br />
  The illusion and mystery of the Inconscient <br />
  In whose black pall the Eternal wraps his head <br />
  That he may act unknown in cosmic Time. <br />
  A splendour of self-creation from the peaks, <br />
  A transfiguration in the mystic depths, <br />
  A happier cosmic working could begin <br />
  And fashion the world-shape in him anew,</p>

<p>God found in Nature, Nature fulfilled in God. <br />
  Already in him was seen that task of Power: <br />
  Life made its home on the high tops of self; <br />
  His soul, mind, heart became a single sun; <br />
  Only life&#8217;s lower reaches remained dim. <br />
  But there too, in the uncertain shadow of life, <br />
  There was a labour and a fiery breath; <br />
  The ambiguous cowled celestial puissance worked <br />
  Watched by the inner Witness&#8217;s moveless peace. <br />
  Even on the struggling Nature left below <br />
  Strong periods of illumination came: <br />
  Lightnings of glory after glory burned, <br />
  Experience was a tale of blaze and fire, <br />
  Air rippled round the argosies of the Gods, <br />
  Strange riches sailed to him from the Unseen; <br />
  Splendours of insight filled the blank of thought, <br />
  Knowledge spoke to the inconscient stillnesses, <br />
  Rivers poured down of bliss and luminous force, <br />
  Visits of beauty, storm-sweeps of delight <br />
  Rained from the all-powerful Mystery above. <br />
  Thence stooped the eagles of Omniscience. <br />
  A dense veil was rent, a mighty whisper heard; <br />
  Repeated in the privacy of his soul, <br />
  A wisdom-cry from rapt transcendences <br />
  Sang on the mountains of an unseen world; <br />
  The voices that an inner listening hears <br />
  Conveyed to him their prophet utterances, <br />
  And flame-wrapped outbursts of the immortal Word <br />
  And flashes of an occult revealing Light <br />
  Approached him from the unreachable Secrecy. <br />
  An inspired Knowledge sat enthroned within <br />
  Whose seconds illumined more than reason&#8217;s years: <br />
  An ictus of revealing lustre fell <br />
  As if a pointing accent upon Truth, <br />
  And like a sky-flare showing all the ground <br />
  A swift intuitive discernment shone.</p>

  Or raise its rapid torch-fire in the dark <br />
  To check the claimants crowding through mind&#8217;s gates <br />
  Covered by the forged signatures of the gods, <br />
  Detect the magic bride in her disguise <br />
  Or scan the apparent face of thought and life. </p>
<p>Oft inspiration with her lightning feet, <br />
  A sudden messenger from the all-seeing tops, <br />
  Traversed the soundless corridors of his mind <br />
  Bringing her rhythmic sense of hidden things. <br />
  A music spoke transcending mortal speech. <br />
  As if from a golden phial of the All-Bliss, <br />
  A joy of light, a joy of sudden sight, <br />
  A rapture of the thrilled undying Word <br />
  Poured into his heart as into an empty cup, <br />
  A repetition of God&#8217;s first delight <br />
  Creating in a young and virgin Time. <br />
  In a brief moment caught, a little space, <br />
  All-Knowledge packed into great wordless thoughts <br />
  Lodged in the expectant stillness of his depths <br />
  A crystal of the ultimate Absolute, <br />
  A portion of the inexpressible Truth <br />
  Revealed by silence to the silent soul. <br />
  The intense creatrix in his stillness wrought; <br />
  Her power fallen speechless grew more intimate; <br />
  She looked upon the seen and the unforeseen, <br />
  Unguessed domains she made her native field. <br />
  All-vision gathered into a single ray, <br />
  As when the eyes stare at an invisible point <br />
  Till through the intensity of one luminous spot <br />
  An apocalypse of a world of images <br />
  Enters into the kingdom of the seer. <br />
  A great nude arm of splendour suddenly rose; <br />
  It rent the gauze opaque of Nescience: <br />
  Her lifted finger&#8217;s keen unthinkable tip</p>

  An eye awake in voiceless heights of trance, <br />
  A mind plucking at the unimaginable, <br />
  Overleaping with a sole and perilous bound <br />
  The high black wall hiding superconscience, <br />
  She broke in with inspired speech for scythe <br />
  And plundered the Unknowable&#8217;s vast estate. <br />
  A gleaner of infinitesimal grains of Truth, <br />

  Or she gathered the lost secrets dropped by Time <br />
  In the dust and crannies of his mounting route <br />
  Mid old forsaken dreams of hastening Mind <br />
  And buried remnants of forgotten space. <br />
  A traveller between summit and abyss, <br />

  A reporter and scribe of hidden wisdom talk, <br />
  Her shining minutes of celestial speech, <br />

  The ways that lead to endless happiness</p>

  Disclosed stood up in a gold moment&#8217;s blaze <br />
  White sun-steppes in the pathless Infinite. <br />
  Along a naked curve in bourneless Self <br />
  The points that run through the closed heart of things <br />
  Shadowed the indeterminable line <br />
  That carries the Everlasting through the years. <br />
  The magician order of the cosmic Mind <br />
  Coercing the freedom of infinity <br />
  With the stark array of Nature&#8217;s symbol facts <br />
  And life&#8217;s incessant signals of event, <br />

  Of the spirit&#8217;s dance with Matter as its mask <br />
  The balance of the world&#8217;s design grew clear, <br />
  Its symmetry of self-arranged effects <br />
  Managed in the deep perspectives of the soul, <br />
  And the realism of its illusive art, <br />
  Its logic of infinite intelligence, <br />
  Its magic of a changing eternity. <br />
  A glimpse was caught of things for ever unknown: <br />
  The letters stood out of the unmoving Word: <br />
  In the immutable nameless Origin <br />
  Was seen emerging as from fathomless seas <br />
  The trail of the Ideas that made the world, <br />
  And, sown in the black earth of Nature&#8217;s trance, <br />
  The seed of the Spirit&#8217;s blind and huge desire <br />
  From which the tree of cosmos was conceived <br />
  And spread its magic arms through a dream of space. <br />
  Immense realities took on a shape: <br />
  There looked out from the shadow of the Unknown <br />
  The bodiless Namelessness that saw God born <br />
  And tries to gain from the mortal&#8217;s mind and soul <br />
  A deathless body and a divine name. <br />

<p>The visage masked by superconscient Sleep, <br />
  The eyes with their closed lids that see all things, <br />
  Appeared of the Architect who builds in trance. <br />
  The original Desire born in the Void <br />
  Peered out; he saw the hope that never sleeps, <br />
  The feet that run behind a fleeting fate, <br />
  The ineffable meaning of the endless dream. <br />
  Hardly for a moment glimpsed viewless to Mind, <br />
  As if a torch held by a power of God, <br />

  Lent a vibrant cry to the unuttered vasts, <br />
  And through great shoreless, voiceless, starless breadths <br />
  Bore earthward fragments of revealing thought <br />
  Hewn from the silence of the Ineffable. <br />
  A Voice in the heart uttered the unspoken Name, <br />
  A dream of seeking Thought wandering through Space <br />
  Entered the invisible and forbidden house: <br />
  The treasure was found of a supernal Day. <br />
  In the deep subconscient glowed her jewel-lamp;</p>

  Where, by the miser traffickers of sense <br />
  Unused, guarded beneath Night&#8217;s dragon paws, <br />
  In folds of velvet darkness draped they sleep <br />
  Whose priceless value could have saved the world. <br />
  A darkness carrying morning in its breast <br />

  And rescue of the lost herds of the Sun. <br />
  In a splendid extravagance of the waste of God <br />

  Hoarded from touch and view and thought&#8217;s desire, <br />
  Locked in blind antres of the ignorant flood, <br />

  A vision lightened on the viewless heights, <br />

  A grand reversal of the Night and Day; <br />
  All the world&#8217;s values changed heightening life&#8217;s aim; <br />
  A wiser word, a larger thought came in <br />

  A secret sense awoke that could perceive <br />
  A Presence and a Greatness everywhere. <br />
  The universe was not now this senseless whirl <br />
  Borne round inert on an immense machine; <br />
  It cast away its grandiose lifeless front, <br />
  A mechanism no more or work of Chance, <br />
  But a living movement of the body of God. <br />
  A spirit hid in forces and in forms <br />
  Was the spectator of the mobile scene: <br />
  The beauty and the ceaseless miracle <br />
  Let in a glow of the Unmanifest: <br />
  The formless Everlasting moved in it</p>

  A secret knowledge masked as Ignorance; <br />
  Fate covered with an unseen necessity <br />
  The game of chance of an omnipotent Will. <br />
  A glory and a rapture and a charm, <br />

  A heavenly impetus quickened all his breast; <br />
  The trudge of Time changed to a splendid march; <br />

  Earth grew too narrow for his victory. <br />
  Once only registering the heavy tread <br />

  All now suppressed in us began to emerge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus came his soul&#8217;s release from Ignorance, <br />
  His mind and body&#8217;s first spiritual change. <br />
  A wide God-knowledge poured down from above, <br />
  A new world-knowledge broadened from within: <br />

  His grasp surprised her mightiest energies&#8217; springs; <br />
  He spoke with the unknown Guardians of the worlds, <br />
  Forms he descried our mortal eyes see not. <br />
  His wide eyes bodied viewless entities, <br />
  He saw the cosmic forces at their work <br />

  Time&#8217;s secrets were to him an oft-read book; <br />

  One and harmonious by the Maker&#8217;s skill, <br />
  The human in him paced with the divine; <br />
  His acts betrayed not the interior flame. <br />
  This forged the greatness of his front to earth. <br />
  A genius heightened in his body&#8217;s cells <br />
  That knew the meaning of his fate-hedged works <br />
  Akin to the march of unaccomplished Powers <br />
  Beyond life&#8217;s arc in spirit&#8217;s immensities. <br />
  Apart he lived in his mind&#8217;s solitude, <br />
  A demigod shaping the lives of men: <br />
  One soul&#8217;s ambition lifted up the race; <br />
  A Power worked, but none knew whence it came. <br />
  The universal strengths were linked with his; <br />
  Filling earth&#8217;s smallness with their boundless breadths,</p>
