<p>Then suddenly there rose a sacred stir. <br />
  Amid the lifeless silence of the Void <br />
  In a solitude and an immensity <br />
  A sound came quivering like a loved footfall <br />
  Heard in the listening spaces of the soul; <br />
  A touch perturbed his fibres with delight. <br />
  An Influence had approached the mortal range, <br />
  A boundless Heart was near his longing heart, <br />
  A mystic Form enveloped his earthly shape. <br />
  All at her contact broke from silence&#8217; seal; <br />
  Spirit and body thrilled identified, <br />
  Linked in the grasp of an unspoken joy; <br />
  Mind, members, life were merged in ecstasy. <br />
  Intoxicated as with nectarous rain <br />
  His nature&#8217;s passioning stretches flowed to her, <br />
  Flashing with lightnings, mad with luminous wine. <br />
  All was a limitless sea that heaved to the moon. <br />
  A divinising stream possessed his veins, <br />
  His body&#8217;s cells awoke to spirit sense, <br />
  Each nerve became a burning thread of joy: <br />
  Tissue and flesh partook beatitude. <br />
  Alight, the dun unplumbed subconscient caves <br />
  Thrilled with the prescience of her longed-for tread <br />
  And filled with flickering crests and praying tongues. <br />
  Even lost in slumber, mute, inanimate <br />
  His very body answered to her power. <br />
  The One he worshipped was within him now: <br />
  Flame-pure, ethereal-tressed, a mighty Face <br />
  Appeared and lips moved by immortal words; <br />
  Lids, Wisdom&#8217;s leaves, drooped over rapture&#8217;s orbs. <br />
  A marble monument of ponderings, shone</p>

<p>A forehead, sight&#8217;s crypt, and large like ocean&#8217;s gaze <br />
  Towards Heaven, two tranquil eyes of boundless thought <br />
  Looked into man&#8217;s and saw the god to come. <br />
  A Shape was seen on threshold Mind, a Voice <br />
  Absolute and wise in the heart&#8217;s chambers spoke: <br />
  &#8220;O Son of Strength who climbst creation&#8217;s peaks, <br />
  No soul is thy companion in the light; <br />
  Alone thou standest at the eternal doors. <br />
  What thou hast won is thine, but ask no more. <br />
  O Spirit aspiring in an ignorant frame, <br />
  O Voice arisen from the Inconscient&#8217;s world, <br />
  How shalt thou speak for men whose hearts are dumb, <br />
  Make purblind earth the soul&#8217;s seer-vision&#8217;s home <br />
  Or lighten the burden of the senseless globe? <br />
  I am the Mystery beyond reach of mind, <br />
  I am the goal of the travail of the suns; <br />
  My fire and sweetness are the cause of life. <br />
  But too immense my danger and my joy. <br />
  Awake not the immeasurable descent, <br />
  Speak not my secret name to hostile Time; <br />
  Man is too weak to bear the Infinite&#8217;s weight. <br />
  Truth born too soon might break the imperfect earth. <br />
  Leave the all-seeing Power to hew its way: <br />
  In thy single vast achievement reign apart <br />
  Helping the world with thy great lonely days. <br />
  I ask thee not to merge thy heart of flame <br />
  In the Immobile&#8217;s wide uncaring bliss, <br />
  Turned from the fruitless motion of the years, <br />
  Deserting the fierce labour of the worlds, <br />
  Aloof from beings, lost in the Alone. <br />
  How shall thy mighty spirit brook repose <br />
  While Death is still unconquered on the earth <br />
  And Time a field of suffering and pain? <br />
  Thy soul was born to share the laden Force; <br />
  Obey thy nature and fulfil thy fate: <br />
  Accept the difficulty and godlike toil,</p>

<p>For the slow-paced omniscient purpose live. <br />
  The Enigma&#8217;s knot is tied in humankind. <br />
  A lightning from the heights that think and plan, <br />
  Ploughing the air of life with vanishing trails, <br />
  Man, sole awake in an unconscious world, <br />
  Aspires in vain to change the cosmic dream. <br />
  Arrived from some half-luminous Beyond <br />
  He is a stranger in the mindless vasts; <br />
  A traveller in his oft-shifting home <br />
  Amid the tread of many infinities, <br />
  He has pitched a tent of life in desert Space. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s fixed regard beholds him from above, <br />
  In the house of Nature a perturbing guest, <br />
  A voyager twixt Thought&#8217;s inconstant shores, <br />
  A hunter of unknown and beautiful Powers, <br />
  A nomad of the far mysterious Light, <br />
  In the wide ways a little spark of God. <br />
  Against his spirit all is in dire league, <br />
  A Titan influence stops his Godward gaze. <br />
  Around him hungers the unpitying Void, <br />
  The eternal Darkness seeks him with her hands, <br />
  Inscrutable Energies drive him and deceive, <br />
  Immense implacable deities oppose. <br />
  An inert Soul and a somnambulist Force <br />
  Have made a world estranged from life and thought; <br />
  The Dragon of the dark foundations keeps <br />
  Unalterable the law of Chance and Death; <br />
  On his long way through Time and Circumstance <br />
  The grey-hued riddling nether shadow-Sphinx, <br />
  Her dreadful paws upon the swallowing sands, <br />
  Awaits him armed with the soul-slaying word: <br />
  Across his path sits the dim camp of Night. <br />
  His day is a moment in perpetual Time; <br />
  He is the prey of the minutes and the hours. <br />
  Assailed on earth and unassured of heaven, <br />
  Descended here unhappy and sublime,</p>

<p>A link between the demigod and the beast, <br />
  He knows not his own greatness nor his aim; <br />
  He has forgotten why he has come and whence. <br />
  His spirit and his members are at war; <br />
  His heights break off too low to reach the skies, <br />
  His mass is buried in the animal mire. <br />
  A strange antinomy is his nature&#8217;s rule. <br />
  A riddle of opposites is made his field: <br />
  Freedom he asks but needs to live in bonds, <br />
  He has need of darkness to perceive some light <br />
  And need of grief to feel a little bliss; <br />
  He has need of death to find a greater life. <br />
  All sides he sees and turns to every call; <br />
  He has no certain light by which to walk; <br />
  His life is a blind-man&#8217;s-buff, a hide-and-seek; <br />
  He seeks himself and from himself he runs; <br />
  Meeting himself, he thinks it other than he. <br />
  Always he builds, but finds no constant ground, <br />
  Always he journeys, but nowhere arrives; <br />
  He would guide the world, himself he cannot guide; <br />
  He would save his soul, his life he cannot save. <br />
  The light his soul had brought his mind has lost; <br />
  All he has learned is soon again in doubt; <br />
  A sun to him seems the shadow of his thoughts, <br />
  Then all is shadow again and nothing true: <br />
  Unknowing what he does or whither he tends <br />
  He fabricates signs of the Real in Ignorance. <br />
  He has hitched his mortal error to Truth&#8217;s star. <br />
  Wisdom attracts him with her luminous masks, <br />
  But never has he seen the face behind: <br />
  A giant Ignorance surrounds his lore. <br />
  Assigned to meet the cosmic mystery <br />
  In the dumb figure of a material world, <br />
  His passport of entry false and his personage, <br />
  He is compelled to be what he is not; <br />
  He obeys the Inconscience he had come to rule</p>

<p>And sinks in Matter to fulfil his soul. <br />
  Awakened from her lower driven forms <br />
  The Earth-Mother gave her forces to his hands <br />
  And painfully he guards the heavy trust; <br />
  His mind is a lost torch-bearer on her roads. <br />
  Illumining breath to think and plasm to feel, <br />
  He labours with his slow and sceptic brain <br />
  Helped by the reason&#8217;s vacillating fires, <br />
  To make his thought and will a magic door <br />
  For knowledge to enter the darkness of the world <br />
  And love to rule a realm of strife and hate. <br />
  A mind impotent to reconcile heaven and earth <br />
  And tied to Matter with a thousand bonds, <br />
  He lifts himself to be a conscious god. <br />
  Even when a glory of wisdom crowns his brow, <br />
  When mind and spirit shed a grandiose ray <br />
  To exalt this product of the sperm and gene, <br />
  This alchemist&#8217;s miracle from plasm and gas, <br />
  And he who shared the animal&#8217;s run and crawl <br />
  Lifts his thought-stature to the Immortal&#8217;s heights, <br />
  His life still keeps the human middle way; <br />
  His body he resigns to death and pain, <br />
  Abandoning Matter, his too heavy charge. <br />
  A thaumaturge sceptic of miracles, <br />
  A spirit left sterile of its occult power <br />
  By an unbelieving brain and credulous heart, <br />
  He leaves the world to end where it began: <br />
  His work unfinished he claims a heavenly prize. <br />
  Thus has he missed creation&#8217;s absolute. <br />
  Half-way he stops his star of destiny: <br />
  A vast and vain long-tried experiment, <br />
  An ill-served high conception doubtfully done, <br />
  The world&#8217;s life falters on not seeing its goal,&#8211; <br />
  A zigzag towards unknown dangerous ground <br />
  Ever repeating its habitual walk, <br />
  Ever retreating after marches long</p>

<p>And hardiest victories without sure result, <br />
  Drawn endlessly an inconclusive game. <br />
  In an ill-fitting and voluminous robe <br />
  A radiant purpose still conceals its face, <br />
  A mighty blindness stumbles hoping on, <br />
  Feeding its strength on gifts of luminous Chance. <br />
  Because the human instrument has failed, <br />
  The Godhead frustrate sleeps within its seed, <br />
  A spirit entangled in the forms it made. <br />
  His failure is not failure whom God leads; <br />
  Through all the slow mysterious march goes on: <br />
  An immutable Power has made this mutable world; <br />
  A self-fulfilling transcendence treads man&#8217;s road; <br />
  The driver of the soul upon its path, <br />
  It knows its steps, its way is inevitable, <br />
  And how shall the end be vain when God is guide? <br />
  However man&#8217;s mind may tire or fail his flesh, <br />
  A will prevails cancelling his conscious choice: <br />
  The goal recedes, a bourneless vastness calls <br />
  Retreating into an immense Unknown; <br />
  There is no end to the world&#8217;s stupendous march, <br />
  There is no rest for the embodied soul. <br />
  It must live on, describe all Time&#8217;s huge curve. <br />
  An Influx presses from the closed Beyond <br />
  Forbidding to him rest and earthly ease, <br />
  Till he has found himself he cannot pause. <br />
  A Light there is that leads, a Power that aids; <br />
  Unmarked, unfelt it sees in him and acts: <br />
  Ignorant, he forms the All-Conscient in his depths, <br />
  Human, looks up to superhuman peaks: <br />
  A borrower of Supernature&#8217;s gold, <br />
  He paves his road to Immortality. <br />
  The high gods look on man and watch and choose <br />
  Today&#8217;s impossibles for the future&#8217;s base. <br />
  His transience trembles with the Eternal&#8217;s touch, <br />
  His barriers cede beneath the Infinite&#8217;s tread;</p>

  He lays his hands sometimes on the Unknown; <br />
  He communes sometimes with Eternity. <br />
  A strange and grandiose symbol was his birth <br />
  And immortality and spirit-room <br />
  And pure perfection and a shadowless bliss <br />
  Are this afflicted creature&#8217;s mighty fate. <br />
  In him the Earth-Mother sees draw near the change <br />
  Foreshadowed in her dumb and fiery depths, <br />
  A godhead drawn from her transmuted limbs, <br />
  An alchemy of Heaven on Nature&#8217;s base. <br />
  Adept of the self-born unfailing line, <br />
  Leave not the light to die the ages bore, <br />
  Help still humanity&#8217;s blind and suffering life: <br />
  Obey thy spirit&#8217;s wide omnipotent urge. <br />
  A witness to God&#8217;s parley with the Night, <br />
  It leaned compassionate from immortal calm <br />
  And housed desire, the troubled seed of things. <br />
  Assent to thy high self, create, endure. <br />
  Cease not from knowledge, let thy toil be vast. <br />
  No more can earthly limits pen thy force; <br />
  Equal thy work with long unending Time&#8217;s. <br />

  Where is the thunder of thy victory&#8217;s wings? <br />

<p>A plan in the occult eternal Mind <br />
  Mapped out to backward and prophetic sight, <br />
  The aeons ever repeat their changeless round, <br />
  The cycles all rebuild and ever aspire. <br />
  All we have done is ever still to do. <br />
  All breaks and all renews and is the same. <br />
  Huge revolutions of life&#8217;s fruitless gyre, <br />

  Too little the strength that now with us is born, <br />
  Too faint the light that steals through Nature&#8217;s lids, <br />
  Too scant the joy with which she buys our pain. <br />
  In a brute world that knows not its own sense, <br />
  Thought-racked upon the wheel of birth we live, <br />
  The instruments of an impulse not our own <br />
  Moved to achieve with our heart&#8217;s blood for price <br />
  Half-knowledge, half-creations that soon tire. <br />
  A foiled immortal soul in perishing limbs, <br />
  Baffled and beaten back we labour still; <br />
  Annulled, frustrated, spent, we still survive. <br />
  In anguish we labour that from us may rise <br />

  A golden vessel of the incarnate Truth, <br />

  For even through the mists of mortal thought <br />
  Infallible are thy mysterious steps, <br />
  And, though Necessity dons the garb of Chance, <br />
  Hidden in the blind shifts of Fate she keeps <br />
  The slow calm logic of Infinity&#8217;s pace <br />
  And the inviolate sequence of its will. <br />
  All life is fixed in an ascending scale <br />

  Come crowding down the amber stairs of birth; <br />
  Forerunners of a divine multitude, <br />
  Out of the paths of the morning star they came <br />
  Into the little room of mortal life. <br />
  I saw them cross the twilight of an age, <br />

  The great creators with wide brows of calm,</p>

  Of Nature and wing back to hidden shores. <br />
  The eternal seeker in the aeonic field <br />
  Besieged by the intolerant press of hours <br />
  Again was strong for great swift-footed deeds.</p>

  He saw the unnumbered people of the stars <br />
  And heard the questioning of the unsatisfied flood <br />
  And toiled with the form-maker, measuring Mind. <br />
  A wanderer from the occult invisible suns <br />
  Accomplishing the fate of transient things, <br />
  A god in the figure of the arisen beast, <br />
  He raised his brow of conquest to the heavens <br />
  Establishing the empire of the soul <br />
  On Matter and its bounded universe <br />
  As on a solid rock in infinite seas. <br />
  The Lord of Life resumed his mighty rounds <br />
  In the scant field of the ambiguous globe. </p>
