<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A mightier task remained than all he had done. <br />
  To That he turned from which all being comes, <br />
  A sign attending from the Secrecy <br />
  Which knows the Truth ungrasped behind our thoughts <br />
  And guards the world with its all-seeing gaze. <br />
  In the unapproachable stillness of his soul, <br />
  Intense, one-pointed, monumental, lone, <br />
  Patient he sat like an incarnate hope <br />
  Motionless on a pedestal of prayer. <br />
  A strength he sought that was not yet on earth, <br />
  Help from a Power too great for mortal will, <br />
  The light of a Truth now only seen afar, <br />
  A sanction from his high omnipotent Source. <br />
  But from the appalling heights there stooped no voice; <br />
  The timeless lids were closed; no opening came. <br />
  A neutral helpless void oppressed the years. <br />
  In the texture of our bound humanity <br />
  He felt the stark resistance huge and dumb <br />
  Of our inconscient and unseeing base, <br />
  The stubborn mute rejection in life&#8217;s depths, <br />
  The ignorant No in the origin of things. <br />
  A veiled collaboration with the Night <br />
  Even in himself survived and hid from his view: <br />
  Still something in his earthly being kept <br />
  Its kinship with the Inconscient whence it came. <br />
  A shadowy unity with a vanished past <br />
  Treasured in an old-world frame was lurking there, <br />
  Secret, unnoted by the illumined mind, <br />
  And in subconscious whispers and in dream <br />
  Still murmured at the mind&#8217;s and spirit&#8217;s choice. <br />
  Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains</td>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">
<p>Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall, <br />
  And old ideal voices wandering moaned <br />
  And pleaded for a heavenly leniency <br />
  To the gracious imperfections of our earth <br />
  And the sweet weaknesses of our mortal state. <br />
  This now he willed to discover and exile, <br />
  The element in him betraying God. <br />
  All Nature&#8217;s recondite spaces were stripped bare, <br />
  All her dim crypts and corners searched with fire <br />
  Where refugee instincts and unshaped revolts <br />
  Could shelter find in darkness&#8217; sanctuary <br />
  Against the white purity of heaven&#8217;s cleansing flame. <br />
  All seemed to have perished that was undivine: <br />
  Yet some minutest dissident might escape <br />
  And still a centre lurk of the blind force. <br />
  For the Inconscient too is infinite; <br />
  The more its abysses we insist to sound, <br />
  The more it stretches, stretches endlessly. <br />
  Then lest a human cry should spoil the Truth <br />
  He tore desire up from its bleeding roots <br />
  And offered to the gods the vacant place. <br />
  Thus could he bear the touch immaculate. <br />
  A last and mightiest transformation came. <br />
  His soul was all in front like a great sea <br />
  Flooding the mind and body with its waves; <br />
  His being, spread to embrace the universe, <br />
  United the within and the without <br />
  To make of life a cosmic harmony, <br />
  An empire of the immanent Divine. <br />
  In this tremendous universality <br />
  Not only his soul-nature and mind-sense <br />
  Included every soul and mind in his, <br />
  But even the life of flesh and nerve was changed <br />
  And grew one flesh and nerve with all that lives; <br />
  He felt the joy of others as his joy, <br />
  He bore the grief of others as his grief;</p>

<p>His universal sympathy upbore, <br />
  Immense like ocean, the creation&#8217;s load <br />
  As earth upbears all beings&#8217; sacrifice, <br />
  Thrilled with the hidden Transcendent&#8217;s joy and peace. <br />
  There was no more division&#8217;s endless scroll; <br />
  One grew the Spirit&#8217;s secret unity, <br />
  All Nature felt again the single bliss. <br />
  There was no cleavage between soul and soul, <br />
  There was no barrier between world and God. <br />
  Overpowered were form and memory&#8217;s limiting line; <br />
  The covering mind was seized and torn apart; <br />
  It was dissolved and now no more could be, <br />
  The one Consciousness that made the world was seen; <br />
  All now was luminosity and force. <br />
  Abolished in its last thin fainting trace <br />
  The circle of the little self was gone; <br />
  The separate being could no more be felt; <br />
  It disappeared and knew itself no more, <br />
  Lost in the spirit&#8217;s wide identity. <br />
  His nature grew a movement of the All, <br />
  Exploring itself to find that all was He, <br />
  His soul was a delegation of the All <br />
  That turned from itself to join the one Supreme. <br />
  Transcended was the human formula; <br />
  Man&#8217;s heart that had obscured the Inviolable <br />
  Assumed the mighty beating of a god&#8217;s; <br />
  His seeking mind ceased in the Truth that knows; <br />
  His life was a flow of the universal life. <br />
  He stood fulfilled on the world&#8217;s highest line <br />
  Awaiting the ascent beyond the world, <br />
  Awaiting the descent the world to save. <br />
  A Splendour and a Symbol wrapped the earth, <br />
  Serene epiphanies looked and hallowed vasts <br />
  Surrounded, wise infinitudes were close <br />
  And bright remotenesses leaned near and kin. <br />
  Sense failed in that tremendous lucency;</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Ephemeral voices from his hearing fell <br />
  And Thought potent no more sank large and pale <br />
  Like a tired god into mysterious seas. <br />
  The robes of mortal thinking were cast down <br />
  Leaving his knowledge bare to absolute sight; <br />
  Fate&#8217;s driving ceased and Nature&#8217;s sleepless spur: <br />
  The athlete heavings of the will were stilled <br />
  In the Omnipotent&#8217;s unmoving peace. <br />
  Life in his members lay down vast and mute; <br />
  Naked, unwalled, unterrified it bore <br />
  The immense regard of Immortality. <br />
  The last movement died and all at once grew still. <br />
  A weight that was the unseen Transcendent&#8217;s hand <br />
  Laid on his limbs the Spirit&#8217;s measureless seal, <br />
  Infinity swallowed him into shoreless trance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As one who sets his sail towards mysteried shores <br />
  Driven through huge oceans by the breath of God, <br />
  The fathomless below, the unknown around, <br />
  His soul abandoned the blind star-field, Space. <br />
  Afar from all that makes the measured world, <br />
  Plunging to hidden eternities it withdrew <br />
  Back from mind&#8217;s foaming surface to the Vasts <br />
  Voiceless within us in omniscient sleep. <br />
  Above the imperfect reach of word and thought, <br />
  Beyond the sight that seeks support of form, <br />
  Lost in deep tracts of superconscient Light, <br />
  Or voyaging in blank featureless Nothingness, <br />
  Sole in the trackless Incommensurable, <br />
  Or past not-self and self and selflessness, <br />
  Transgressing the dream-shores of conscious mind <br />
  He reached at last his sempiternal base. <br />
  On sorrowless heights no winging cry disturbs, <br />
  Pure and untouched above this mortal play <br />
  Is spread the spirit&#8217;s hushed immobile air. <br />
  There no beginning is and there no end;</p>

<p>There is the stable force of all that moves; <br />
  There the aeonic labourer is at rest. <br />
  There turns no keyed creation in the void, <br />
  No giant mechanism watched by a soul; <br />
  There creaks no fate-turned huge machinery; <br />
  The marriage of evil with good within one breast, <br />
  The clash of strife in the very clasp of love, <br />
  The dangerous pain of life&#8217;s experiment <br />
  In the values of Inconsequence and Chance, <br />
  The peril of mind&#8217;s gamble, throwing our lives <br />
  As stake in a wager of indifferent gods <br />
  And the shifting lights and shadows of the idea <br />
  Falling upon the surface consciousness, <br />
  And in the dream of a mute witness soul <br />
  Creating the error of a half-seen world <br />
  Where knowledge is a seeking ignorance, <br />
  Life&#8217;s steps a stumbling series without suit, <br />
  Its aspect of fortuitous design, <br />
  Its equal measure of the true and false <br />
  In that immobile and immutable realm <br />
  Find no access, no cause, no right to live: <br />
  There only reigns the spirit&#8217;s motionless power <br />
  Poised in itself through still eternity <br />
  And its omniscient and omnipotent peace. <br />
  Thought clashes not with thought and truth with truth, <br />
  There is no war of right with rival right; <br />
  There are no stumbling and half-seeing lives <br />
  Passing from chance to unexpected chance, <br />
  No suffering of hearts compelled to beat <br />
  In bodies of the inert Inconscient&#8217;s make. <br />
  Armed with the immune occult unsinking Fire <br />
  The guardians of Eternity keep its law <br />
  For ever fixed upon Truth&#8217;s giant base <br />
  In her magnificent and termless home. <br />
  There Nature on her dumb spiritual couch <br />
  Immutably transcendent knows her source</p>

  Existence found its truth on Oneness&#8217; breast <br />
  And each became the self and space of all. <br />
  The great world-rhythms were heart-beats of one Soul, <br />
  To feel was a flame-discovery of God, <br />
  All mind was a single harp of many strings, <br />
  All life a song of many meeting lives; <br />
  For worlds were many, but the Self was one. <br />

  Incalculable outflowing infinitudes <br />

  Lived their innumerable unity; <br />
  Worlds where the being is unbound and wide <br />
  Bodied unthinkably the egoless Self; <br />
  Rapture of beatific energies <br />
  Joined Time to the Timeless, poles of a single joy; <br />
  White vasts were seen where all is wrapped in all. <br />
  There were no contraries, no sundered parts, <br />
  All by spiritual links were joined to all <br />
  And bound indissolubly to the One: <br />
  Each was unique, but took all lives as his own, <br />
  And, following out these tones of the Infinite, <br />
  Recognised in himself the universe. <br />
  A splendid centre of infinity&#8217;s whirl <br />
  Pushed to its zenith&#8217;s height, its last expanse, <br />
  Felt the divinity of its own self-bliss <br />
  Repeated in its numberless other selves: <br />

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">And on it left like a lost dream&#8217;s vain mould, <br />
  A fragile copy of the spirit&#8217;s shell, <br />
  His body gathered into mystic sleep. <br />
  A foreign shape it seemed, a mythic shade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alien now seemed that dim far universe, <br />
  Self and eternity alone were true. <br />
  Then memory climbed to him from the striving planes <br />
  Bringing a cry from once-loved cherished things, <br />
  And to the cry as to its own lost call <br />
  A ray replied from the occult Supreme. <br />
  For even there the boundless Oneness dwells. <br />
  To its own sight unrecognisable, <br />
  It lived still sunk in its own tenebrous seas, <br />
  Upholding the world&#8217;s inconscient unity <br />
  Hidden in Matter&#8217;s insentient multitude. <br />
  This seed-self sown in the Indeterminate <br />
  Forfeits its glory of divinity, <br />
  Concealing the omnipotence of its Force, <br />
  Concealing the omniscience of its Soul; <br />
  An agent of its own transcendent Will, <br />
  It merges knowledge in the inconscient deep; <br />
  Accepting error, sorrow, death and pain, <br />
  It pays the ransom of the ignorant Night, <br />
  Redeeming by its substance Nature&#8217;s fall. <br />
  Himself he knew and why his soul had gone <br />
  Into earth&#8217;s passionate obscurity <br />
  To share the labour of an errant Power <br />
  Which by division hopes to find the One. <br />
  Two beings he was, one wide and free above, <br />
  One struggling, bound, intense, its portion here. <br />
  A tie between them still could bridge two worlds; <br />
  There was a dim response, a distant breath; <br />
  All had not ceased in the unbounded hush. <br />
  His heart lay somewhere conscious and alone <br />
  Far down below him like a lamp in night;</p>

<p>Abandoned it lay, alone, imperishable, <br />
  Immobile with excess of passionate will, <br />
  His living, sacrificed and offered heart <br />
  Absorbed in adoration mystical, <br />
  Turned to its far-off fount of light and love. <br />
  In the luminous stillness of its mute appeal <br />
  It looked up to the heights it could not see; <br />
  It yearned from the longing depths it could not leave. <br />
  In the centre of his vast and fateful trance <br />
  Half-way between his free and fallen selves, <br />
  Interceding twixt God&#8217;s day and the mortal&#8217;s night, <br />
  Accepting worship as its single law, <br />
  Accepting bliss as the sole cause of things, <br />
  Refusing the austere joy which none can share, <br />
  Refusing the calm that lives for calm alone, <br />
  To her it turned for whom it willed to be. <br />
  In the passion of its solitary dream <br />
  It lay like a closed soundless oratory <br />
  Where sleeps a consecrated argent floor <br />
  Lit by a single and untrembling ray <br />
  And an invisible Presence kneels in prayer. <br />
  On some deep breast of liberating peace <br />
  All else was satisfied with quietude; <br />
  This only knew there was a truth beyond. <br />
  All other parts were dumb in centred sleep <br />
  Consenting to the slow deliberate Power <br />
  Which tolerates the world&#8217;s error and its grief, <br />
  Consenting to the cosmic long delay, <br />
  Timelessly waiting through the patient years <br />
  Her coming they had asked for earth and men; <br />
  This was the fiery point that called her now. <br />
  Extinction could not quench that lonely fire; <br />
  Its seeing filled the blank of mind and will; <br />
  Thought dead, its changeless force abode and grew. <br />
  Armed with the intuition of a bliss <br />
  To which some moved tranquillity was the key,</p>
