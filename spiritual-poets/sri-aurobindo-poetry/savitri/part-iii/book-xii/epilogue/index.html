<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Out of abysmal trance her spirit woke. <br />
  Lain on the earth-mother&#8217;s calm inconscient breast <br />
  She saw the green-clad branches lean above <br />
  Guarding her sleep with their enchanted life, <br />
  And overhead a blue-winged ecstasy <br />
  Fluttered from bough to bough with high-pitched call. <br />
  Into the magic secrecy of the woods <br />
  Peering through an emerald lattice-window of leaves, <br />
  In indolent skies reclined, the thinning day <br />
  Turned to its slow fall into evening&#8217;s peace. <br />
  She pressed the living body of Satyavan: <br />
  On her body&#8217;s wordless joy to be and breathe <br />
  She bore the blissful burden of his head <br />
  Between her breasts&#8217; warm labour of delight, <br />
  The waking gladness of her members felt <br />
  The weight of heaven in his limbs, a touch <br />
  Summing the whole felicity of things, <br />
  And all her life was conscious of his life <br />
  And all her being rejoiced enfolding his. <br />
  The immense remoteness of her trance had passed; <br />
  Human she was once more, earth&#8217;s Savitri, <br />
  Yet felt in her illimitable change. <br />
  A power dwelt in her soul too great for earth, <br />
  A bliss lived in her heart too large for heaven; <br />
  Light too intense for thought and love too boundless <br />
  For earth&#8217;s emotions lit her skies of mind <br />
  And spread through her deep and happy seas of soul. <br />
  All that is sacred in the world drew near <br />
  To her divine passivity of mood. <br />
  A marvellous voice of silence breathed its thoughts. <br />
  All things in Time and Space she had taken for hers;&nbsp;</td>

<p>In her they moved, by her they lived and were, <br />
  The whole wide world clung to her for delight, <br />
  Created for her rapt embrace of love. <br />
  Now in her spaceless self released from bounds <br />
  Unnumbered years seemed moments long drawn out, <br />
  The brilliant time-flakes of eternity. <br />
  Outwingings of a bird from its bright home, <br />
  Her earthly morns were radiant flights of joy. <br />
  Boundless she was, a form of infinity. <br />
  Absorbed no longer by the moment&#8217;s beat <br />
  Her spirit the unending future felt <br />
  And lived with all the unbeginning past. <br />
  Her life was a dawn&#8217;s victorious opening, <br />
  The past and unborn days had joined their dreams, <br />
  Old vanished eves and far arriving noons <br />
  Hinted to her a vision of prescient hours. <br />
  Supine in musing bliss she lay awhile <br />
  Given to the wonder of a waking trance; <br />
  Half-risen then she sent her gaze around, <br />
  As if to recover old sweet trivial threads, <br />
  Old happy thoughts, small treasured memories, <br />
  And weave them into one immortal day. <br />
  Ever she held on the paradise of her breast <br />
  Her lover charmed into a fathomless sleep, <br />
  Lain like an infant spirit unaware <br />
  Lulled on the verge of two consenting worlds. <br />
  But soon she leaned down over her loved to call <br />
  His mind back to her with her travelling touch <br />
  On his closed eyelids; settled was her still look <br />
  Of strong delight, not yearning now, but large <br />
  With limitless joy or sovereign last content, <br />
  Pure, passionate with the passion of the gods. <br />
  Desire stirred not its wings; for all was made <br />
  An overarching of celestial rays <br />
  Like the absorbed control of sky on plain, <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s leaning down to embrace from all sides earth,</p>

<p>A quiet rapture, a vast security. <br />
  Then sighing to her touch the soft-winged sleep <br />
  Rose hovering from his flowerlike lids and flew <br />
  Murmurous away. Awake, he found her eyes <br />
  Waiting for his, and felt her hands, and saw <br />
  The earth his home given back to him once more <br />
  And her made his again, his passion&#8217;s all. <br />
  With his arms&#8217; encircling hold around her locked, <br />
  A living knot to make possession close, <br />
  He murmured with hesitating lips her name, <br />
  And vaguely recollecting wonder cried, <br />
  &#8220;Whence hast thou brought me captive back, love-chained, <br />
  To thee and sunlight&#8217;s walls, O golden beam <br />
  And casket of all sweetness, Savitri, <br />
  Godhead and woman, moonlight of my soul? <br />
  For surely I have travelled in strange worlds <br />
  By thee companioned, a pursuing spirit, <br />
  Together we have disdained the gates of night. <br />
  I have turned away from the celestials&#8217; joy <br />
  And heaven&#8217;s insufficient without thee. <br />
  Where now has passed that formidable Shape <br />
  Which rose against us, the Spirit of the Void, <br />
  Claiming the world for Death and Nothingness, <br />
  Denying God and soul? Or was all a dream <br />
  Or a vision seen in a spiritual sleep, <br />
  A symbol of the oppositions of Time <br />
  Or a mind-lit beacon of significance <br />
  In some stress of darkness lighting on the Way <br />
  Or guiding a swimmer through the straits of Death, <br />
  Or finding with the succour of its ray <br />
  In a gully mid the crowded streets of Chance <br />
  The soul that into the world-adventure came, <br />
  A scout and voyager from Eternity?&#8221; <br />
  But she replied, &#8220;Our parting was the dream; <br />
  We are together, we live, O Satyavan. <br />
  Look round thee and behold, glad and unchanged</p>

  And a new flame of worship in his eyes: <br />
  &#8220;What high change is in thee, O Savitri? Bright <br />
  Ever thou wast, a goddess still and pure, <br />
  Yet dearer to me by thy sweet human parts <br />
  Earth gave thee making thee yet more divine. <br />
  My adoration mastered, my desire <br />
  Bent down to make its subject, my daring clasped, <br />
  Claiming by body and soul my life&#8217;s estate, <br />
  Rapture&#8217;s possession, love&#8217;s sweet property, <br />
  A statue of silence in my templed spirit, <br />
  A yearning godhead and a golden bride. <br />
  But now thou seemst almost too high and great <br />
  For mortal worship; Time lies below thy feet <br />
  And the whole world seems only a part of thee, <br />
  Thy presence the hushed heaven I inhabit, <br />
  And thou lookst on me in the gaze of the stars, <br />
  Yet art the earthly keeper of my soul, <br />
  My life a whisper of thy dreaming thoughts, <br />
  My morns a gleaming of thy spirit&#8217;s wings, <br />
  And day and night are of thy beauty part.</p>

<p>Hast thou not taken my heart to treasure it <br />
  In the secure environment of thy breast? <br />
  Awakened from the silence and the sleep, <br />
  I have consented for thy sake to be. <br />
  By thee I have greatened my mortal arc of life, <br />
  But now far heavens, unmapped infinitudes <br />
  Thou hast brought me, thy illimitable gift! <br />
  If to fill these thou lift thy sacred flight, <br />
  My human earth will still demand thy bliss. <br />
  Make still my life through thee a song of joy <br />
  And all my silence wide and deep with thee.&#8221; <br />
  A heavenly queen consenting to his will, <br />
  She clasped his feet, by her enshrining hair <br />
  Enveloped in a velvet cloak of love, <br />
  And answered softly like a murmuring lute: <br />
  &#8220;All now is changed, yet all is still the same. <br />
  Lo, we have looked upon the face of God, <br />
  Our life has opened with divinity. <br />
  We have borne identity with the Supreme <br />
  And known his meaning in our mortal lives. <br />
  Our love has grown greater by that mighty touch <br />
  And learned its heavenly significance, <br />
  Yet nothing is lost of mortal love&#8217;s delight. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s touch fulfils but cancels not our earth: <br />
  Our bodies need each other in the same last; <br />
  Still in our breasts repeat heavenly secret rhythm <br />
  Our human heart-beats passionately close. <br />
  Still am I she who came to thee mid the murmur <br />
  Of sunlit leaves upon this forest verge; <br />
  I am the Madran, I am Savitri. <br />
  All that I was before, I am to thee still, <br />
  Close comrade of thy thoughts and hopes and toils, <br />
  All happy contraries I would join for thee. <br />
  All sweet relations marry in our life; <br />
  I am thy kingdom even as thou art mine, <br />
  The sovereign and the slave of thy desire,</p>

<p>Thy prone possessor, sister of thy soul <br />
  And mother of thy wants; thou art my world, <br />
  The earth I need, the heaven my thoughts desire, <br />
  The world I inhabit and the god I adore. <br />
  Thy body is my body&#8217;s counterpart <br />
  Whose every limb my answering limb desires, <br />
  Whose heart is key to all my heart-beats,&#8211;this <br />
  I am and thou to me, O Satyavan. <br />
  Our wedded walk through life begins anew, <br />
  No gladness lost, no depth of mortal joy. <br />
  Let us go through this new world that is the same, <br />
  For it is given back, but it is known, <br />
  A playing-ground and dwelling-house of God <br />
  Who hides himself in bird and beast and man <br />
  Sweetly to find himself again by love, <br />
  By oneness. His presence leads the rhythms of life <br />
  That seek for mutual joy in spite of pain. <br />
  We have each other found, O Satyavan, <br />
  In the great light of the discovered soul. <br />
  Let us go back, for eve is in the skies. <br />
  Now grief is dead and serene bliss remains <br />
  The heart of all our days for evermore. <br />
  Lo, all these beings in this wonderful world! <br />
  Let us give joy to all, for joy is ours. <br />
  For not for ourselves alone our spirits came <br />
  Out of the veil of the Unmanifest, <br />
  Out of the deep immense Unknowable <br />
  Upon the ignorant breast of dubious earth, <br />
  Into the ways of labouring, seeking men, <br />
  Two fires that burn towards that parent Sun, <br />
  Two rays that travel to the original Light. <br />
  To lead man&#8217;s soul towards truth and God we are born, <br />
  To draw the chequered scheme of mortal life <br />
  Into some semblance of the Immortal&#8217;s plan, <br />
  To shape it closer to an image of God, <br />
  A little nearer to the Idea divine.&#8221;</p>

  As if to keep him on her bosom worn <br />
  For ever through the journeying of the years. <br />
  So for a while they stood entwined, their kiss <br />
  And passion-tranced embrace a meeting-point <br />
  In their commingling spirits one for ever, <br />
  Two-souled, two-bodied for the joys of Time. <br />
  Then hand in hand they left that solemn place <br />
  Full now of mute unusual memories, <br />
  To the green distance of their sylvan home <br />
  Returning slowly through the forest&#8217;s heart. <br />
  Round them the afternoon to evening changed; <br />
  Light slipped down to the brightly sleeping verge, <br />
  And the birds came back winging to their nests, <br />
  And day and night leaned to each other&#8217;s arms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the dusk shadowy trees stood close around <br />
  Like dreaming spirits and, delaying night, <br />
  The grey-eyed pensive evening heard their steps, <br />
  And from all points the cries and movements came <br />
  Of the four-footed wanderers of the night <br />
  Approaching. Then a human rumour rose <br />
  Long alien to their solitary days, <br />
  Invading the charmed wilderness of leaves <br />
  Once sacred to secluded loneliness <br />
  With violent breaking of its virgin sleep. <br />
  Through the screened dusk it deepened still and there neared <br />
  Floating of many voices and the sound <br />
  Of many feet, till on their sight broke in <br />
  As if a coloured wave upon the eye <br />
  The brilliant strenuous crowded days of man. <br />
  Topped by a flaring multitude of lights <br />
  A great resplendent company arrived. <br />
  Life in its ordered tumult wavering came <br />
  Bringing its stream of unknown faces, thronged <br />
  With gold-fringed headdresses, gold-broidered robes,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Glittering of ornaments, fluttering of hems, <br />
  Hundreds of hands parted the forest-boughs, <br />
  Hundreds of eyes searched the entangled glades. <br />
  Calm white-clad priests their grave-eyed sweetness brought, <br />
  Strong warriors in their glorious armour shone, <br />
  The proud-hooved steeds came trampling through the wood. <br />
  In front King Dyumatsena walked, no more <br />
  Blind, faltering-limbed, but his far-questing eyes <br />
  Restored to all their confidence in light <br />
  Took seeingly this imaged outer world; <br />
  Firmly he trod with monarch step the soil. <br />
  By him that queen and mother&#8217;s anxious face <br />
  Came changed from its habitual burdened look <br />
  Which in its drooping strength of tired toil <br />
  Had borne the fallen life of those she loved. <br />
  Her patient paleness wore a pensive glow <br />
  Like evening&#8217;s subdued gaze of gathered light <br />
  Departing, which foresees sunrise her child. <br />
  Sinking in quiet splendours of her sky, <br />
  She lives awhile to muse upon that hope, <br />
  The brilliance of her rich receding gleam <br />
  A thoughtful prophecy of lyric dawn. <br />
  Her eyes were first to find her children&#8217;s forms. <br />
  But at the vision of the beautiful twain <br />
  The air awoke perturbed with scaling cries, <br />
  And the swift parents hurrying to their child,&#8211; <br />
  Their cause of life now who had given him breath,&#8211; <br />
  Possessed him with their arms. Then tenderly <br />
  Cried Dyumatsena chiding Satyavan: <br />
  &#8220;The fortunate gods have looked on me today, <br />
  A kingdom seeking came and heaven&#8217;s rays. <br />
  But where wast thou? Thou hast tormented gladness <br />
  With fear&#8217;s dull shadow, O my child, my life. <br />
  What danger kept thee for the darkening woods? <br />
  Or how could pleasure in her ways forget <br />
  That useless orbs without thee are my eyes</p>

<p>Which only for thy sake rejoice at light? <br />
  Not like thyself was this done, Savitri, <br />
  Who ledst not back thy husband to our arms, <br />
  Knowing with him beside me only is taste <br />
  In food and for his touch evening and morn <br />
  I live content with my remaining days.&#8221; <br />
  But Satyavan replied with smiling lips, <br />
  &#8220;Lay all on her; she is the cause of all. <br />
  With her enchantments she has twined me round. <br />
  Behold, at noon leaving this house of clay <br />
  I wandered in far-off eternities, <br />
  Yet still, a captive in her golden hands, <br />
  I tread your little hillock called green earth <br />
  And in the moments of your transient sun <br />
  Live glad among the busy works of men.&#8221; <br />
  Then all eyes turned their wondering looks where stood, <br />
  A deepening redder gold upon her cheeks, <br />
  With lowered lids the noble lovely child, <br />
  And one consenting thought moved every breast. <br />
  &#8220;What gleaming marvel of the earth or skies <br />
  Stands silently by human Satyavan <br />
  To mark a brilliance in the dusk of eve? <br />
  If this is she of whom the world has heard, <br />
  Wonder no more at any happy change. <br />
  Each easy miracle of felicity <br />
  Of her transmuting heart the alchemy is.&#8221; <br />
  Then one spoke there who seemed a priest and sage: <br />
  &#8220;O woman soul, what light, what power revealed, <br />
  Working the rapid marvels of this day, <br />
  Opens for us by thee a happier age?&#8221; <br />
  Her lashes fluttering upwards gathered in <br />
  To a vision which had scanned immortal things, <br />
  Rejoicing, human forms for their delight. <br />
  They claimed for their deep childlike motherhood <br />
  The life of all these souls to be her life, <br />
  Then falling veiled the light. Low she replied,&nbsp;</p>

  Wondering at her and her too luminous words <br />
  Westward they turned in the fast-gathering night. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the entangling verges freed they came <br />
  Into a dimness of the sleeping earth <br />
  And travelled through her faint and slumbering plains. <br />
  Murmur and movement and the tread of men <br />
  Broke the night&#8217;s solitude; the neigh of steeds <br />
  Rose from that indistinct and voiceful sea <br />
  Of life and all along its marchings swelled <br />
  The rhyme of hooves, the chariot&#8217;s homeward voice. <br />
  Drawn by white manes upon a high-roofed car <br />
  In flare of the unsteady torches went <br />
  With linked hands Satyavan and Savitri, <br />
  Hearing a marriage march and nuptial hymn, <br />
  Where waited them the many-voiced human world. <br />
  Numberless the stars swam on their shadowy field <br />
  Describing in the gloom the ways of light. <br />
  Then while they skirted yet the southward verge, <br />
  Lost in the halo of her musing brows <br />
  Night, splendid with the moon dreaming in heaven <br />
  In silver peace, possessed her luminous reign. <br />
  She brooded through her stillness on a thought <br />
  Deep-guarded by her mystic folds of light, <br />
  And in her bosom nursed a greater dawn.</p>
