  On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection&#8217;s home, <br />
  Magical unfoldings of the Eternal&#8217;s smile <br />
  Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight. <br />
  God&#8217;s everlasting day surrounded her, <br />
  Domains appeared of sempiternal light <br />
  Invading all Nature with the Absolute&#8217;s joy. <br />
  Her body quivered with eternity&#8217;s touch, <br />
  Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite. <br />
  Infinity&#8217;s finite fronts she lived in, new <br />
  For ever to an everliving sight. <br />
  Eternity multiplied its vast self-look <br />
  Translating its endless mightiness and joy <br />
  Into delight souls playing with Time could share <br />
  In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths, <br />
  In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights, <br />
  In passionate heart-beats of an undying love, <br />
  In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade. <br />
  Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes, <br />
  In serene arches of translucent calm <br />
  From Wonder&#8217;s dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down <br />
  An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes <br />
  Which suffered without pain the absolute ray <br />
  And saw immortal clarities of form. <br />
  Twilight and mist were exiles from that air, <br />
  Night was impossible to such radiant heavens. <br />
  Firm in the bosom of immensity <br />
  Spiritual breadths were seen, sublimely born <br />
  From a still beauty of creative joy; <br />
  Embodied thoughts to sweet dimensions held

<p>To please some carelessness of divine peace, <br />
  Answered the deep demand of an infinite sense <br />
  And its need of forms to house its bodiless thrill. <br />
  A march of universal powers in Time, <br />
  The harmonic order of self&#8217;s vastitudes <br />
  In cyclic symmetries and metric planes <br />
  Harboured a cosmic rapture&#8217;s revelry, <br />
  An endless figuring of the spirit in things <br />
  Planned by the artist who has dreamed the worlds; <br />
  Of all the beauty and the marvel here, <br />
  Of all Time&#8217;s intricate variety <br />
  Eternity was the substance and the source; <br />
  Not from a plastic mist of Matter made, <br />
  They offered the suggestion of their depths <br />
  And opened the great series of their powers. <br />
  Arisen beneath a triple mystic heaven <br />
  The seven immortal earths were seen, sublime: <br />
  Homes of the blest released from death and sleep <br />
  Where grief can never come nor any pang <br />
  Arriving from self-lost and seeking worlds <br />
  Alter Heaven-nature&#8217;s changeless quietude <br />
  And mighty posture of eternal calm, <br />
  Its pose of ecstasy immutable. <br />
  Plains lay that seemed the expanse of God&#8217;s wide sleep, <br />
  Thought&#8217;s wings climbed up towards heaven&#8217;s vast repose <br />
  Lost in blue deeps of immortality. <br />
  A changed earth-nature felt the breath of peace. <br />
  Air seemed an ocean of felicity <br />
  Or the couch of the unknown spiritual rest, <br />
  A vast quiescence swallowing up all sound <br />
  Into a voicelessness of utter bliss; <br />
  Even Matter brought a close spiritual touch, <br />
  All thrilled with the immanence of one divine. <br />
  The lowest of these earths was still a heaven <br />
  Translating into the splendour of things divine <br />
  The beauty and brightness of terrestrial scenes.</p>

<p>Eternal mountains ridge on gleaming ridge <br />
  Whose lines were graved as on a sapphire plate <br />
  And etched the borders of heaven&#8217;s lustrous noon <br />
  Climbed like piled temple stairs and from their heads <br />
  Of topless meditation heard below <br />
  The approach of a blue pilgrim multitude <br />
  And listened to a great arriving voice <br />
  Of the wide travel hymn of timeless seas. <br />
  A chanting crowd from mountain bosoms slipped <br />
  Past branches fragrant with a sigh of flowers <br />
  Hurrying through sweetnesses with revel leaps; <br />
  The murmurous rivers of felicity <br />
  Divinely rippled honey-voiced desires, <br />
  Mingling their sister eddies of delight, <br />
  Then, widening to a pace of calm-lipped muse, <br />
  Down many-glimmered estuaries of dream <br />
  Went whispering into lakes of liquid peace. <br />
  On a brink held of senseless ecstasy <br />
  And guarding an eternal poise of thought <br />
  Sat sculptured souls dreaming by rivers of sound <br />
  In changeless attitudes of marble bliss. <br />
  Around her lived the children of God&#8217;s day <br />
  In an unspeakable felicity, <br />
  A happiness never lost, the immortal&#8217;s ease, <br />
  A glad eternity&#8217;s blissful multitude. <br />
  Around, the deathless nations moved and spoke, <br />
  Souls of a luminous celestial joy, <br />
  Faces of stark beauty, limbs of the moulded Ray; <br />
  In cities cut like gems of conscious stone <br />
  And wonderful pastures and on gleaming coasts <br />
  Bright forms were seen, eternity&#8217;s luminous tribes. <br />
  Above her rhythming godheads whirled the spheres, <br />
  Rapt mobile fixities here blindly sought <br />
  By the huge erring orbits of our stars. <br />
  Ecstatic voices smote at hearing&#8217;s chords, <br />
  Each movement found a music all its own;</p>

  The colours of whose plumage had been caught <br />
  From the rainbow of imagination&#8217;s wings. <br />

  In groves that seemed moved bosoms and trembling depths <br />

  Eternised to Heaven&#8217;s ever-wakeful sight <br />
  The crowding petal-glow of marvel&#8217;s tints <br />
  Which float across the curtained lids of dream. <br />
  Immortal harmonies filled her listening ear; <br />
  A great spontaneous utterance of the heights <br />
  On Titan wings of rhythmic grandeur borne <br />
  Poured from some deep spiritual heart of sound, <br />
  Strains trembling with the secrets of the gods. <br />
  A spirit wandered happily in the wind, <br />
  A spirit brooded in the leaf and stone; <br />
  The voices of thought-conscious instruments <br />
  Along a living verge of silence strayed, <br />
  And from some deep, a wordless tongue of things <br />
  Unfathomed, inexpressible, chantings rose <br />
  Translating into a voice the Unknown. <br />
  A climber on the invisible stair of sound, <br />
  Music not with these few and striving steps <br />
  Aspired that wander upon transient strings, <br />
  But changed its ever new uncounted notes <br />
  In a passion of unforeseeing discovery, <br />
  And kept its old unforgotten ecstasies <br />
  A growing treasure in the mystic heart. <br />
  A consciousness that yearned through every cry <br />
  Of unexplored attraction and desire, <br />
  It found and searched again the unsatisfied deeps <br />
  Hunting as if in some deep secret heart</p>

<p>To find some lost or missed felicity. <br />
  In those far-lapsing symphonies she could hear, <br />
  Breaking through enchantments of the ravished sense, <br />
  The lyric voyage of a divine soul <br />
  Mid spume and laughter tempting with its prow <br />
  The charm of innocent Circean isles, <br />
  Adventures without danger beautiful <br />
  In lands where siren Wonder sings its lures <br />
  From rhythmic rocks in ever-foaming seas. <br />
  In the harmony of an original sight <br />
  Delivered from our limiting ray of thought, <br />
  And the reluctance of our blinded hearts <br />
  To embrace the Godhead in whatever guise, <br />
  She saw all Nature marvellous without fault. <br />
  Invaded by beauty&#8217;s universal revel <br />
  Her being&#8217;s fibre reached out vibrating <br />
  And claimed deep union with its outer selves, <br />
  And on the heart&#8217;s chords made pure to seize all tones <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s subtleties of touch unwearying forced <br />
  More vivid raptures than earth&#8217;s life can bear. <br />
  What would be suffering here, was fiery bliss. <br />
  All here but passionate hint and mystic shade <br />
  Divined by the inner prophet who perceives <br />
  The spirit of delight in sensuous things, <br />
  Turned to more sweetness than can now be dreamed. <br />
  The mighty signs of which earth fears the stress, <br />
  Trembling because she cannot understand, <br />
  And must keep obscure in forms strange and sublime, <br />
  Were here the first lexicon of an infinite mind <br />
  Translating the language of eternal bliss. <br />
  Here rapture was a common incident; <br />
  The lovelinesses of whose captured thrill <br />
  Our human pleasure is a fallen thread, <br />
  Lay, symbol shapes, a careless ornament, <br />
  Sewn on the rich brocade of Godhead&#8217;s dress. <br />
  Things fashioned were the imaged homes where mind</p>

<p>Arrived to fathom a deep physical joy; <br />
  The heart was a torch lit from infinity, <br />
  The limbs were trembling densities of soul. <br />
  These were the first domains, the outer courts <br />
  Immense but least in range and least in price, <br />
  The slightest ecstasies of the undying gods. <br />
  Higher her swing of vision swept and knew, <br />

  Into the wideness of a light beyond, <br />

  Where finite and the infinite are one, <br />
  Immune she beheld the strong immortals&#8217; seats <br />
  Who live for a celestial joy and rule, <br />
  The middle regions of the unfading Ray. <br />
  Great forms of deities sat in deathless tiers, <br />

  Shapes of entrancing sweetness spilling bliss, <br />

  A tangle of bright bodies, of moved souls <br />
  Tracing the close and intertwined delight, <br />
  The harmonious tread of lives for ever joined <br />
  In the passionate oneness of a mystic joy <br />
  As if sunbeams made living and divine, <br />
  The golden-bosomed Apsara goddesses, <br />
  In groves flooded from an argent disk of bliss <br />
  That floated through a luminous sapphire dream, <br />
  In a cloud of raiment lit with golden limbs <br />
  And gleaming footfalls treading faery swards, <br />
  Virgin motions of bacchant innocences</p>

  Whirled linked in moonlit revels of the heart. <br />
  Impeccable artists of unerring forms, <br />
  Magician builders of sound and rhythmic words, <br />
  Wind-haired Gandharvas chanted to the ear <br />
  The odes that shape the universal thought, <br />
  The lines that tear the veil from Deity&#8217;s face, <br />
  The rhythms that bring the sounds of wisdom&#8217;s sea. <br />
  Immortal figures and illumined brows, <br />

  High seers, moved poets saw the eternal thoughts <br />
  That, travellers from on high, arrive to us <br />
  Deformed by our search, tricked by costuming mind, <br />
  Like gods disfigured by the pangs of birth, <br />
  Seized the great words which now are frail sounds caught <br />
  By difficult rapture on a mortal tongue. <br />
  The strong who stumble and sin were calm proud gods. <br />

  Beyond what tongue can utter or mind dream: <br />
  Worlds of an infinite reach crowned Nature&#8217;s stir. <br />
  There was a greater tranquil sweetness there, <br />
  A subtler and profounder ether&#8217;s field <br />
  And mightier scheme than heavenliest sense can give. <br />
  There breath carried a stream of seeing mind, <br />
  Form was a tenuous raiment of the soul: <br />

  Shapes seen half immaterial by the gaze</p>

  The labour of the stars a circuit vain <br />
  And death the end of every human road <br />
  And grief and pain the wages of man&#8217;s toil. <br />
  One whom her soul had faced as Death and Night <br />
  A sum of all sweetness gathered into his limbs <br />

<p>Transfigured was the formidable shape. <br />
  His darkness and his sad destroying might <br />
  Abolishing for ever and disclosing <br />
  The mystery of his high and violent deeds, <br />
  A secret splendour rose revealed to sight <br />
  Where once the vast embodied Void had stood. <br />
  Night the dim mask had grown a wonderful face. <br />
  The vague infinity was slain whose gloom <br />
  Had outlined from the terrible unknown <br />
  The obscure disastrous figure of a god, <br />
  Fled was the error that arms the hands of grief, <br />
  And lighted the ignorant gulf whose hollow deeps <br />
  Had given to nothingness a dreadful voice. <br />

  A golden blaze of thought inscribed within, <br />
  A marvellous form responded to her gaze <br />
  Whose sweetness justified life&#8217;s blindest pain; <br />
  All Nature&#8217;s struggle was its easy price, <br />
  The universe and its agony seemed worth while. <br />
  As if the choric calyx of a flower <br />
  Aerial, visible on music&#8217;s waves, <br />
  A lotus of light-petalled ecstasy <br />
  Took shape out of the tremulous heart of things. <br />

  There was no more the dark pretence of hate, <br />
  The cruel rictus on Love&#8217;s altered face. <br />
  Hate was the grip of a dreadful amour&#8217;s strife; <br />
  A ruthless love intent only to possess <br />
  Has here replaced the sweet original god. <br />
  Forgetting the Will-to-love that gave it birth, <br />
  The passion to lock itself in and to unite, <br />
  It would swallow all into one lonely self, <br />
  Devouring the soul that it had made its own,</p>

  A Will that without sense or motive acts, <br />
  An Intelligence needing not to think or plan, <br />
  The world creates itself invincibly; <br />

  Meanwhile you two shall serve the dual law <br />
  Which only now the scouts of vision glimpse <br />
  Who pressing through the forest of their thoughts <br />
  Have found the narrow bridges of the gods. <br />
  Wait patient of the brittle bars of form <br />
  Making division your delightful means <br />
  Of happy oneness rapturously enhanced <br />
  By attraction in the throbbing air between.</p>

<p>Yet if thou wouldst abandon the vexed world, <br />
  Careless of the dark moan of things below, <br />
  Tread down the isthmus, overleap the flood, <br />
  Cancel thy contract with the labouring Force; <br />
  Renounce the tie that joins thee to earth-kind, <br />
  Cast off thy sympathy with mortal hearts. <br />
  Arise, vindicate thy spirit&#8217;s conquered right: <br />
  Relinquishing thy charge of transient breath, <br />
  Under the cold gaze of the indifferent stars <br />
  Leaving thy borrowed body on the sod, <br />
  Ascend, O soul, into thy blissful home. <br />
  Here in the playground of the eternal Child <br />
  Or in domains the wise Immortals tread <br />
  Roam with thy comrade splendour under skies <br />
  Spiritual lit by an unsetting sun, <br />
  As godheads live who care not for the world <br />
  And share not in the toil of Nature&#8217;s powers: <br />
  Absorbed in their self-ecstasy they dwell. <br />
  Cast off the ambiguous myth of earth&#8217;s desire, <br />
  O immortal, to felicity arise.&#8221; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Savitri listening in her tranquil heart <br />
  To the harmony of the ensnaring voice <br />
  A joy exceeding earth&#8217;s and heaven&#8217;s poured down, <br />
  The bliss of an unknown eternity, <br />
  A rapture from some waiting Infinite. <br />
  A smile came rippling out in her wide eyes, <br />
  Its confident felicity&#8217;s messenger <br />
  As if the first beam of the morning sun <br />
  Rippled along two wakened lotus-pools. <br />
  &#8220;O besetter of man&#8217;s soul with life and death <br />
  And the world&#8217;s pleasure and pain and Day and Night, <br />
  Tempting his heart with the far lure of heaven, <br />
  Testing his strength with the close touch of hell, <br />
  I climb not to thy everlasting Day, <br />
  Even as I have shunned thy eternal Night. <br />
  To me who turn not from thy terrestrial Way,</p>

<p>Give back the other self my nature asks. <br />
  Thy spaces need him not to help their joy; <br />
  Earth needs his beautiful spirit made by thee <br />
  To fling delight down like a net of gold. <br />
  Earth is the chosen place of mightiest souls; <br />
  Earth is the heroic spirit&#8217;s battlefield, <br />
  The forge where the Archmason shapes his works. <br />
  Thy servitudes on earth are greater, King, <br />
  Than all the glorious liberties of heaven. <br />
  The heavens were once to me my natural home, <br />
  I too have wandered in star-jewelled groves, <br />
  Paced sun-gold pastures and moon-silver swards <br />
  And heard the harping laughter of their streams <br />
  And lingered under branches dropping myrrh; <br />
  I too have revelled in the fields of light <br />
  Touched by the ethereal raiment of the winds, <br />
  Thy wonder-rounds of music I have trod, <br />
  Lived in the rhyme of bright unlabouring thoughts, <br />
  I have beat swift harmonies of rapture vast, <br />
  Danced in spontaneous measures of the soul <br />
  The great and easy dances of the gods. <br />
  O fragrant are the lanes thy children walk <br />
  And lovely is the memory of their feet <br />
  Amid the wonder-flowers of Paradise: <br />
  A heavier tread is mine, a mightier touch. <br />
  There where the gods and demons battle in night <br />
  Or wrestle on the borders of the Sun, <br />
  Taught by the sweetness and the pain of life <br />
  To bear the uneven strenuous beat that throbs <br />
  Against the edge of some divinest hope, <br />
  To dare the impossible with these pangs of search, <br />
  In me the spirit of immortal love <br />
  Stretches its arms out to embrace mankind. <br />
  Too far thy heavens for me from suffering men. <br />
  Imperfect is the joy not shared by all. <br />
  O to spread forth, O to encircle and seize</p>

  O life, the life beneath the wheeling stars! <br />
  For victory in the tournament with death, <br />
  For bending of the fierce and difficult bow, <br />
  For flashing of the splendid sword of God! <br />
  O thou who soundst the trumpet in the lists, <br />
  Part not the handle from the untried steel, <br />
  Take not the warrior with his blow unstruck. <br />
  Are there not still a million fights to wage? <br />
  O king-smith, clang on still thy toil begun, <br />
  Weld us to one in thy strong smithy of life. <br />
  Thy fine-curved jewelled hilt call Savitri, <br />
  Thy blade&#8217;s exultant smile name Satyavan. <br />
  Fashion to beauty, point us through the world. <br />
  Break not the lyre before the song is found; <br />
  Are there not still unnumbered chants to weave? <br />
  O subtle-souled musician of the years, <br />
  Play out what thou hast fluted on my stops; <br />
  Arise from the strain their first wild plaint divined <br />
  And that discover which is yet unsung. <br />
  I know that I can lift man&#8217;s soul to God, <br />
  I know that he can bring the Immortal down. <br />
  Our will labours permitted by thy will <br />
  And without thee an empty roar of storm, <br />
  A senseless whirlwind is the Titan&#8217;s force <br />
  And without thee a snare the strength of gods. <br />
  Let not the inconscient gulf swallow man&#8217;s race <br />
  That through earth&#8217;s ignorance struggles towards thy Light. <br />
  O Thunderer with the lightnings of the soul, <br />
  Give not to darkness and to death thy sun, <br />
  Achieve thy wisdom&#8217;s hidden firm decree <br />
  And the mandate of thy secret world-wide love.&#8221; <br />
  Her words failed lost in thought&#8217;s immensities <br />
  Which seized them at the limits of their cry <br />
  And hid their meaning in the distances <br />
  That stir to more than ever speech has won</p>

  And the Ineffable from whom all words come. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with a smile august as noonday heavens <br />
  The godhead of the vision wonderful: <br />
  &#8220;How shall earth-nature and man&#8217;s nature rise <br />
  To the celestial levels, yet earth abide? <br />
  Heaven and earth towards each other gaze <br />
  Across a gulf that few can cross, none touch, <br />
  Arriving through a vague ethereal mist <br />
  Out of which all things form that move in space, <br />
  The shore that all can see but never reach. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s light visits sometimes the mind of earth; <br />
  Its thoughts burn in her sky like lonely stars; <br />
  In her heart there move celestial seekings soft <br />
  And beautiful like fluttering wings of birds, <br />
  Visions of joy that she can never win <br />
  Traverse the fading mirror of her dreams. <br />
  Faint seeds of light and bliss bear sorrowful flowers, <br />
  Faint harmonies caught from a half-heard song <br />
  Fall swooning mid the wandering voices&#8217; jar, <br />
  Foam from the tossing luminous seas where dwells <br />
  The beautiful and far delight of gods, <br />
  Raptures unknown, a miracled happiness <br />
  Thrill her and pass half-shaped to mind and sense. <br />
  Above her little finite steps she feels, <br />
  Careless of knot or pause, worlds which weave out <br />
  A strange perfection beyond law and rule, <br />
  A universe of self-found felicity, <br />
  An inexpressible rhythm of timeless beats, <br />
  The many-movemented heart-beats of the One, <br />
  Magic of the boundless harmonies of self, <br />
  Order of the freedom of the infinite, <br />
  The wonder-plastics of the Absolute. <br />
  There is the All-Truth and there the timeless bliss. <br />

<p>Hers are but careless visits of the gods. <br />
  They are a Light that fails, a Word soon hushed <br />
  And nothing they mean can stay for long on earth. <br />
  There are high glimpses, not the lasting sight. <br />
  A few can climb to an unperishing sun, <br />
  Or live on the edges of the mystic moon <br />
  And channel to earth-mind the wizard ray. <br />
  The heroes and the demigods are few <br />
  To whom the close immortal voices speak <br />
  And to their acts the heavenly clan are near. <br />
  Few are the silences in which Truth is heard, <br />
  Unveiling the timeless utterance in her deeps; <br />
  Few are the splendid moments of the seers. <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s call is rare, rarer the heart that heeds; <br />
  The doors of light are sealed to common mind <br />
  And earth&#8217;s needs nail to earth the human mass, <br />
  Only in an uplifting hour of stress <br />
  Men answer to the touch of greater things: <br />
  Or, raised by some strong hand to breathe heaven-air, <br />
  They slide back to the mud from which they climbed; <br />
  In the mud of which they are made, whose law they know <br />
  They joy in safe return to a friendly base, <br />
  And, though something in them weeps for glory lost <br />
  And greatness murdered, they accept their fall. <br />
  To be the common man they think the best, <br />
  To live as others live is their delight. <br />
  For most are built on Nature&#8217;s early plan <br />
  And owe small debt to a superior plane; <br />
  The human average is their level pitch, <br />
  A thinking animal&#8217;s material range. <br />
  In the long ever-mounting hierarchy, <br />
  In the stark economy of cosmic life <br />
  Each creature to its appointed task and place <br />
  Is bound by his nature&#8217;s form, his spirit&#8217;s force. <br />
  If this were easily disturbed, it would break <br />
  The settled balance of created things;</p>

<p>The perpetual order of the universe <br />
  Would tremble, and a gap yawn in woven Fate. <br />
  If men were not and all were brilliant gods, <br />
  The mediating stair would then be lost <br />
  By which the spirit awake in Matter winds <br />
  Accepting the circuits of the middle Way, <br />
  By heavy toil and slow aeonic steps <br />
  Reaching the bright miraculous fringe of God, <br />
  Into the glory of the Oversoul. <br />
  My will, my call is there in men and things; <br />
  But the Inconscient lies at the world&#8217;s grey back <br />
  And draws to its breast of Night and Death and Sleep. <br />
  Imprisoned in its dark and dumb abyss <br />
  A little consciousness it lets escape <br />
  But jealous of the growing light holds back <br />
  Close to the obscure edges of its cave <br />
  As if a fond ignorant mother kept her child <br />
  Tied to her apron strings of Nescience. <br />
  The Inconscient could not read without man&#8217;s mind <br />
  The mystery of the world its sleep has made: <br />
  Man is its key to unlock a conscious door. <br />
  But still it holds him dangled in its grasp: <br />
  It draws its giant circle round his thoughts, <br />
  It shuts his heart to the supernal Light. <br />
  A high and dazzling limit shines above, <br />
  A black and blinding border rules below: <br />
  His mind is closed between two firmaments. <br />
  He seeks through words and images the Truth, <br />
  And, poring on surfaces and brute outsides <br />
  Or dipping cautious feet in shallow seas, <br />
  Even his Knowledge is an Ignorance. <br />
  He is barred out from his own inner depths; <br />
  He cannot look on the face of the Unknown. <br />
  How shall he see with the Omniscient&#8217;s eyes, <br />
  How shall he will with the Omnipotent&#8217;s force? <br />
  O too compassionate and eager Dawn,</p>

  Lift up the fallen heart of love which flutters <br />
  Cast down desire&#8217;s abyss into the gulfs. <br />
  For ever rescued out of Nature&#8217;s shapes <br />
  Discover what the aimless cycles want, <br />
  There intertwined with all thy life has meant, <br />
  Here vainly sought in a terrestrial form. <br />
  Break into eternity thy mortal mould; <br />

  Even the charm of thy alluring voice, <br />

  I sacrifice not earth to happier worlds. <br />

  Set Nature to a huge and meaningless task <br />

  What force condemned to birth and death and tears <br />
  These conscious creatures crawling on the globe? <br />
  If earth can look up to the light of heaven <br />
  And hear an answer to her lonely cry, <br />

<p>To be is not a senseless paradox; <br />
  Since God has made earth, earth must make in her God; <br />
  What hides within her breast she must reveal. <br />

  If man lives bound by his humanity, <br />
  If he is tied for ever to his pain, <br />

  It looks through veiling forms at veilless truth; <br />
  It pushes back the curtain of the gods; <br />
  It climbs towards its own eternity.&#8221; <br />

  Pushing the bound and slumbering god in man <br />
  Awakened mid the ineffable silences <br />
  Into endless vistas of the unknown and unseen, <br />
  Across the last confines of the limiting Mind <br />
  And the Superconscient&#8217;s perilous border line <br />

  It alters not the steps of the Unseen. <br />
  If thou must indeed deliver man and earth <br />
  On the spiritual heights look down on life, <br />
  Discover the truth of God and man and world;</p>

<p>Then do thy task knowing and seeing all. <br />
  Ascend, O soul, into thy timeless self; <br />
  Choose destiny&#8217;s curve and stamp thy will on Time.&#8221; <br />
  He ended and upon the falling sound <br />
  A power went forth that shook the founded spheres <br />
  And loosed the stakes that hold the tents of form. <br />
  Absolved from vision&#8217;s grip and the folds of thought, <br />
  Rapt from her sense like disappearing scenes <br />
  In the stupendous theatre of Space <br />
  The heaven-worlds vanished in spiritual light. <br />
  A movement was abroad, a cry, a word, <br />
  Beginningless in its vast discovery, <br />
  Momentless in its unthinkable return: <br />
  Choired in calm seas she heard the eternal Thought <br />
  Rhythming itself abroad unutterably <br />
  In spaceless orbits and on timeless roads. <br />
  In an ineffable world she lived fulfilled. <br />
  An energy of the triune Infinite, <br />
  In a measureless Reality she dwelt, <br />
  A rapture and a being and a force, <br />
  A linked and myriad-motioned plenitude, <br />
  A virgin unity, a luminous spouse, <br />
  Housing a multitudinous embrace <br />
  To marry all in God&#8217;s immense delight, <br />
  Bearing the eternity of every spirit, <br />
  Bearing the burden of universal love, <br />
  A wonderful mother of unnumbered souls. <br />
  All things she knew, all things imagined or willed: <br />
  Her ear was opened to ideal sound, <br />
  Shape the convention bound no more her sight, <br />
  A thousand doors of oneness was her heart. <br />
  A crypt and sanctuary of brooding light <br />
  Appeared, the last recess of things beyond. <br />
  Then in its rounds the enormous fiat paused, <br />
  Silence gave back to the Unknowable <br />
  All it had given. Still was her listening thought.</p>

<p>The form of things had ceased within her soul. <br />
  Invisible that perfect godhead now. <br />
  Around her some tremendous spirit lived, <br />
  Mysterious flame around a melting pearl, <br />
  And in the phantom of abolished Space <br />
  There was a voice unheard by ears that cried: <br />
  &#8220;Choose, spirit, thy supreme choice not given again; <br />
  For now from my highest being looks at thee <br />
  The nameless formless peace where all things rest. <br />

  End of the trouble of thy wandering thoughts, <br />
  Close of the journeying of thy pilgrim soul. <br />
  Accept, O music, weariness of thy notes, <br />
  O stream, wide breaking of thy channel banks.&#8221; <br />
  The moments fell into eternity. <br />
  But someone yearned within a bosom unknown <br />
  And silently the woman&#8217;s heart replied: <br />
  &#8220;Thy peace, O Lord, a boon within to keep <br />
  Amid the roar and ruin of wild Time <br />
  For the magnificent soul of man on earth. <br />
  Thy calm, O Lord, that bears thy hands of joy.&#8221; <br />
  Limitless like ocean round a lonely isle <br />
  A second time the eternal cry arose: <br />
  &#8220;Wide open are the ineffable gates in front. <br />
  My spirit leans down to break the knot of earth, <br />
  Amorous of oneness without thought or sign <br />
  To cast down wall and fence, to strip heaven bare, <br />
  See with the large eye of infinity, <br />
  Unweave the stars and into silence pass.&#8221; <br />
  In an immense and world-destroying pause <br />
  She heard a million creatures cry to her. <br />
  Through the tremendous stillness of her thoughts</p>

  A music beat of winged uniting souls, <br />

  Thy joy, O Lord, in which all creatures breathe, <br />
  Thy magic flowing waters of deep love, <br />
  Thy sweetness give to me for earth and men.&#8221; </p>

  Earth shall be my work-chamber and my house, <br />
  My garden of life to plant a seed divine. <br />
  When all thy work in human time is done <br />

  And the glory of my sun-lift in their thoughts <br />
  And feel in their hearts the sweetness of my love <br />
  And in their acts my Power&#8217;s miraculous drive. <br />
  My will shall be the meaning of their days; <br />
  Living for me, by me, in me they shall live. <br />
  In the heart of my creation&#8217;s mystery <br />
  I will enact the drama of thy soul, <br />
  Inscribe the long romance of Thee and Me. <br />
  I will pursue thee across the centuries; <br />
  Thou shalt be hunted through the world by love, <br />
  Naked of ignorance&#8217; protecting veil <br />
  And without covert from my radiant gods. <br />
  No shape shall screen thee from my divine desire, <br />
  Nowhere shalt thou escape my living eyes. <br />
  In the nudity of thy discovered self, <br />
  In a bare identity with all that is, <br />
  Disrobed of thy covering of humanity, <br />
  Divested of the dense veil of human thought, <br />
  Made one with every mind and body and heart, <br />
  Made one with all Nature and with Self and God, <br />
  Summing in thy single soul my mystic world <br />
  I will possess in thee my universe, <br />
  The universe find all I am in thee. <br />
  Thou shalt bear all things that all things may change, <br />
  Thou shalt fill all with my splendour and my bliss, <br />
  Thou shalt meet all with thy transmuting soul.</p>

  Abandoning the dubious middle Way, <br />
  A few shall glimpse the miraculous Origin <br />
  And some shall feel in you the secret Force <br />
  And they shall turn to meet a nameless tread, <br />
  Adventurers into a mightier Day. <br />
  Ascending out of the limiting breadths of mind, <br />
  They shall discover the world&#8217;s huge design <br />
  And step into the Truth, the Right, the Vast. <br />
  You shall reveal to them the hidden eternities, <br />
  The breath of infinitudes not yet revealed, <br />
  Some rapture of the bliss that made the world, <br />
  Some rush of the force of God&#8217;s omnipotence, <br />
  Some beam of the omniscient Mystery.</p>

<p>But when the hour of the Divine draws near <br />
  The Mighty Mother shall take birth in Time <br />
  And God be born into the human clay <br />
  In forms made ready by your human lives. <br />
  Then shall the Truth supreme be given to men: <br />
  There is a being beyond the being of mind, <br />
  An Immeasurable cast into many forms, <br />
  A miracle of the multitudinous One, <br />
  There is a consciousness mind cannot touch, <br />
  Its speech cannot utter nor its thought reveal. <br />
  It has no home on earth, no centre in man, <br />
  Yet is the source of all things thought and done, <br />
  The fount of the creation and its works, <br />
  It is the origin of all truth here, <br />
  The sun-orb of mind&#8217;s fragmentary rays, <br />
  Infinity&#8217;s heaven that spills the rain of God, <br />
  The Immense that calls to man to expand the Spirit, <br />
  The wide Aim that justifies his narrow attempts, <br />
  A channel for the little he tastes of bliss. <br />
  Some shall be made the glory&#8217;s receptacles <br />
  And vehicles of the Eternal&#8217;s luminous power. <br />
  These are the high forerunners, the heads of Time, <br />
  The great deliverers of earth-bound mind, <br />
  The high transfigurers of human clay, <br />
  The first-born of a new supernal race. <br />
  The incarnate dual Power shall open God&#8217;s door, <br />
  Eternal supermind touch earthly Time. <br />
  The superman shall wake in mortal man <br />
  And manifest the hidden demigod <br />
  Or grow into the God-Light and God-Force <br />
  Revealing the secret deity in the cave. <br />
  Then shall the earth be touched by the Supreme, <br />
  His bright unveiled Transcendence shall illumine <br />
  The mind and heart and force the life and act <br />
  To interpret his inexpressible mystery <br />
  In a heavenly alphabet of Divinity&#8217;s signs.</p>
