<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">There came a slope that slowly downward sank; <br />
  It slipped towards a stumbling grey descent. <br />
  The dim-heart marvel of the ideal was lost; <br />
  Its crowding wonder of bright delicate dreams <br />
  And vague half-limned sublimities she had left: <br />
  Thought fell towards lower levels; hard and tense <br />
  It passioned for some crude reality. <br />
  The twilight floated still but changed its hues <br />
  And heavily swathed a less delightful dream; <br />
  It settled in tired masses on the air; <br />
  Its symbol colours tuned with duller reds <br />
  And almost seemed a lurid mist of day. <br />
  A straining taut and dire besieged her heart; <br />
  Heavy her sense grew with a dangerous load, <br />
  And sadder, greater sounds were in her ears, <br />
  And through stern breakings of the lambent glare <br />
  Her vision caught a hurry of driving plains <br />
  And cloudy mountains and wide tawny streams, <br />
  And cities climbed in minarets and towers <br />
  Towards an unavailing changeless sky: <br />
  Long quays and ghauts and harbours white with sails <br />
  Challenged her sight awhile and then were gone. <br />
  Amidst them travailed toiling multitudes <br />
  In ever shifting perishable groups, <br />
  A foiled cinema of lit shadowy shapes <br />
  Enveloped in the grey mantle of a dream. <br />
  Imagining meanings in life&#8217;s heavy drift, <br />
  They trusted in the uncertain environment <br />
  And waited for death to change their spirit&#8217;s scene. <br />
  A savage din of labour and a tramp <br />
  Of armoured life and the monotonous hum</td>

<p>Of thoughts and acts that ever were the same, <br />
  As if the dull reiterated drone <br />
  Of a great brute machine, beset her soul,&#8211; <br />
  A grey dissatisfied rumour like a ghost <br />
  Of the moaning of a loud unquiet sea. <br />
  A huge inhuman cyclopean voice, <br />
  A Babel-builders&#8217; song towering to heaven, <br />
  A throb of engines and the clang of tools <br />
  Brought the deep undertone of labour&#8217;s pain. <br />
  As when pale lightnings tear a tortured sky, <br />
  High overhead a cloud-rimmed series flared <br />
  Chasing like smoke from a red funnel driven, <br />
  The forced creations of an ignorant Mind: <br />
  Drifting she saw like pictured fragments flee <br />
  Phantoms of human thought and baffled hopes, <br />
  The shapes of Nature and the arts of man, <br />
  Philosophies and disciplines and laws, <br />
  And the dead spirit of old societies, <br />
  Constructions of the Titan and the worm. <br />
  As if lost remnants of forgotten light, <br />
  Before her mind there fled with trailing wings <br />
  Dimmed revelations and delivering words, <br />
  Emptied of their mission and their strength to save, <br />
  The messages of the evangelist gods, <br />
  Voices of prophets, scripts of vanishing creeds. <br />
  Each in its hour eternal claimed went by: <br />
  Ideals, systems, sciences, poems, crafts <br />
  Tireless there perished and again recurred, <br />
  Sought restlessly by some creative Power; <br />
  But all were dreams crossing an empty vast. <br />
  Ascetic voices called of lonely seers <br />
  On mountain summits or by river banks <br />
  Or from the desolate heart of forest glades <br />
  Seeking heaven&#8217;s rest or the spirit&#8217;s worldless peace, <br />
  Or in bodies motionless like statues, fixed <br />
  In tranced cessations of their sleepless thought</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Sat sleeping souls, and this too was a dream. <br />
  All things the past has made and slain were there, <br />
  Its lost forgotten forms that once had lived, <br />
  And all the present loves as new-revealed <br />
  And all the hopes the future brings had failed <br />
  Already, caught and spent in efforts vain, <br />
  Repeated fruitlessly age after age. <br />
  Unwearied all returned insisting still <br />
  Because of joy in the anguish of pursuit <br />
  And joy to labour and to win and lose <br />
  And joy to create and keep and joy to kill. <br />
  The rolling cycles passed and came again, <br />
  Brought the same toils and the same barren end, <br />
  Forms ever new and ever old, the long <br />
  Appalling revolutions of the world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more arose the great destroying Voice: <br />
  Across the fruitless labour of the worlds <br />
  His huge denial&#8217;s all-defeating might <br />
  Pursued the ignorant march of dolorous Time. <br />
  &#8220;Behold the figures of this symbol realm, <br />
  Its solid outlines of creative dream <br />
  Inspiring the great concrete tasks of earth. <br />
  In its motion-parable of human life <br />
  Here thou canst trace the outcome Nature gives <br />
  To the sin of being and the error in things <br />
  And the desire that compels to live <br />
  And man&#8217;s incurable malady of hope. <br />
  In an immutable order&#8217;s hierarchy <br />
  Where Nature changes not, man cannot change: <br />
  Ever he obeys her fixed mutation&#8217;s law; <br />
  In a new version of her oft-told tale <br />
  In ever-wheeling cycles turns the race. <br />
  His mind is pent in circling boundaries: <br />
  For mind is man, beyond thought he cannot soar. <br />
  If he could leave his limits he would be safe:</p>

<p>He sees but cannot mount to his greater heavens; <br />
  Even winged, he sinks back to his native soil. <br />
  He is a captive in his net of mind <br />
  And beats soul-wings against the walls of life. <br />
  In vain his heart lifts up its yearning prayer, <br />
  Peopling with brilliant Gods the formless Void; <br />
  Then disappointed to the Void he turns <br />
  And in its happy nothingness asks release, <br />
  The calm Nirvana of his dream of self: <br />
  The Word in silence ends, in Nought the name. <br />
  Apart amid the mortal multitudes, <br />
  He calls the Godhead incommunicable <br />
  To be the lover of his lonely soul <br />
  Or casts his spirit into its void embrace. <br />
  Or he finds his copy in the impartial All; <br />
  He imparts to the Immobile his own will, <br />
  Attributes to the Eternal wrath and love <br />
  And to the Ineffable lends a thousand names. <br />
  Hope not to call God down into his life. <br />
  How shalt thou bring the Everlasting here? <br />
  There is no house for him in hurrying Time. <br />
  Vainly thou seekst in Matter&#8217;s world an aim; <br />
  No aim is there, only a will to be. <br />
  All walk by Nature bound for ever the same. <br />
  Look on these forms that stay awhile and pass, <br />
  These lives that long and strive, then are no more, <br />
  These structures that have no abiding truth, <br />
  The saviour creeds that cannot save themselves, <br />
  But perish in the strangling hands of the years, <br />
  Discarded from man&#8217;s thought, proved false by Time, <br />
  Philosophies that strip all problems bare <br />
  But nothing ever have solved since earth began, <br />
  And sciences omnipotent in vain <br />
  By which men learn of what the suns are made, <br />
  Transform all forms to serve their outward needs, <br />
  Ride through the sky and sail beneath the sea,</p>

  These polities, architectures of man&#8217;s brain, <br />
  That, bricked with evil and good, wall in man&#8217;s spirit <br />
  And, fissured houses, palace at once and jail, <br />
  Rot while they reign and crumble before they crash; <br />
  These revolutions, demon or drunken god, <br />
  Convulsing the wounded body of mankind <br />
  Only to paint in new colours an old face; <br />
  These wars, carnage triumphant, ruin gone mad, <br />
  The work of centuries vanishing in an hour, <br />
  The blood of the vanquished and the victor&#8217;s crown <br />
  Which men to be born must pay for with their pain, <br />
  The hero&#8217;s face divine on satyr&#8217;s limbs, <br />
  The demon&#8217;s grandeur mixed with the demigod&#8217;s, <br />
  The glory and the beasthood and the shame; <br />
  Why is it all, the labour and the din, <br />
  The transient joys, the timeless sea of tears, <br />
  The longing and the hoping and the cry, <br />
  The battle and the victory and the fall, <br />
  The aimless journey that can never pause, <br />
  The waking toil, the incoherent sleep, <br />
  Song, shouts and weeping, wisdom and idle words, <br />
  The laughter of men, the irony of the gods? <br />
  Where leads the march, whither the pilgrimage? <br />
  Who keeps the map of the route or planned each stage? <br />
  Or else self-moved the world walks its own way, <br />
  Or nothing is there but only a Mind that dreams: <br />
  The world is a myth that happened to come true, <br />
  A legend told to itself by conscious Mind, <br />
  Imaged and played on a feigned Matter&#8217;s ground <br />
  On which it stands in an unsubstantial Vast. <br />
  Mind is the author, spectator, actor, stage: <br />
  Mind only is and what it thinks is seen. <br />
  If Mind is all, renounce the hope of bliss; <br />
  If Mind is all, renounce the hope of Truth. <br />
  For Mind can never touch the body of Truth</p>

<p>And Mind can never see the soul of God; <br />
  Only his shadow it grasps nor hears his laugh <br />
  As it turns from him to the vain seeming of things. <br />
  Mind is a tissue woven of light and shade <br />
  Where right and wrong have sewn their mingled parts; <br />
  Or Mind is Nature&#8217;s marriage of convenance <br />
  Between truth and falsehood, between joy and pain: <br />
  This struggling pair no court can separate. <br />
  Each thought is a gold coin with bright alloy <br />
  And error and truth are its obverse and reverse: <br />
  This is the imperial mintage of the brain <br />
  And of this kind is all its currency. <br />
  Think not to plant on earth the living Truth <br />
  Or make of Matter&#8217;s world the home of God; <br />
  Truth comes not there but only the thought of Truth, <br />
  God is not there but only the name of God. <br />
  If Self there is it is bodiless and unborn; <br />
  It is no one and it is possessed by none. <br />
  On what shalt thou then build thy happy world? <br />
  Cast off thy life and mind, then art thou Self, <br />
  An all-seeing omnipresence stark, alone. <br />
  If God there is he cares not for the world; <br />
  All things he sees with calm indifferent gaze, <br />
  He has doomed all hearts to sorrow and desire, <br />
  He has bound all life with his implacable laws; <br />
  He answers not the ignorant voice of prayer. <br />
  Eternal while the ages toil beneath, <br />
  Unmoved, untouched by aught that he has made, <br />
  He sees as minute details mid the stars <br />
  The animal&#8217;s agony and the fate of man: <br />
  Immeasurably wise, he exceeds thy thought; <br />
  His solitary joy needs not thy love. <br />
  His truth in human thinking cannot dwell: <br />
  If thou desirest Truth, then still thy mind <br />
  For ever, slain by the dumb unseen Light. <br />
  Immortal bliss lives not in human air:</p>

<p>How shall the mighty Mother her calm delight <br />
  Keep fragrant in this narrow fragile vase, <br />
  Or lodge her sweet unbroken ecstasy <br />
  In hearts which earthly sorrow can assail <br />
  And bodies careless Death can slay at will? <br />
  Dream not to change the world that God has planned, <br />
  Strive not to alter his eternal law. <br />
  If heavens there are whose gates are shut to grief, <br />
  There seek the joy thou couldst not find on earth; <br />
  Or in the imperishable hemisphere <br />
  Where Light is native and Delight is king <br />
  And Spirit is the deathless ground of things, <br />
  Choose thy high station, child of Eternity. <br />
  If thou art Spirit and Nature is thy robe, <br />
  Cast off thy garb and be thy naked self <br />
  Immutable in its undying truth, <br />
  Alone for ever in the mute Alone. <br />
  Turn then to God, for him leave all behind; <br />
  Forgetting love, forgetting Satyavan, <br />
  Annul thyself in his immobile peace. <br />
  O soul, drown in his still beatitude. <br />
  For thou must die to thyself to reach God&#8217;s height: <br />
  I, Death, am the gate of immortality.&#8221; <br />

  &#8220;Once more wilt thou call Light to blind Truth&#8217;s eyes, <br />
  Make Knowledge a catch of the snare of Ignorance <br />
  And the Word a dart to slay my living soul? <br />
  Offer, O King, thy boons to tired spirits <br />
  And hearts that could not bear the wounds of Time, <br />
  Let those who were tied to body and to mind, <br />
  Tear off those bonds and flee into white calm <br />
  Crying for a refuge from the play of God. <br />
  Surely thy boons are great since thou art He! <br />
  But how shall I seek rest in endless peace <br />
  Who house the mighty Mother&#8217;s violent force, <br />

<p>Her will tempered in the blaze of Wisdom&#8217;s sun <br />
  And the flaming silence of her heart of love? <br />
  The world is a spiritual paradox <br />
  Invented by a need in the Unseen, <br />
  A poor translation to the creature&#8217;s sense <br />
  Of That which for ever exceeds idea and speech, <br />
  A symbol of what can never be symbolised, <br />
  A language mispronounced, misspelt, yet true. <br />
  Its powers have come from the eternal heights <br />
  And plunged into the inconscient dim Abyss <br />
  And risen from it to do their marvellous work. <br />
  The soul is a figure of the Unmanifest, <br />
  The mind labours to think the Unthinkable, <br />
  The life to call the Immortal into birth, <br />
  The body to enshrine the Illimitable. <br />
  The world is not cut off from Truth and God. <br />
  In vain thou hast dug the dark unbridgeable gulf, <br />
  In vain thou hast built the blind and doorless wall: <br />
  Man&#8217;s soul crosses through thee to Paradise, <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s sun forces its way through death and night; <br />
  Its light is seen upon our being&#8217;s verge. <br />
  My mind is a torch lit from the eternal sun, <br />
  My life a breath drawn by the immortal Guest, <br />
  My mortal body is the Eternal&#8217;s house. <br />
  Already the torch becomes the undying ray, <br />
  Already the life is the Immortal&#8217;s force, <br />
  The house grows of the householder part and one. <br />
  How sayst thou Truth can never light the human mind <br />
  And Bliss can never invade the mortal&#8217;s heart <br />
  Or God descend into the world he made? <br />
  If in the meaningless Void creation rose, <br />
  If from a bodiless Force Matter was born, <br />
  If Life could climb in the unconscious tree, <br />
  Its green delight break into emerald leaves <br />
  And its laughter of beauty blossom in the flower, <br />
  If sense could wake in tissue, nerve and cell</p>

  And soul peep from its secrecy through the flesh, <br />
  How shall the nameless Light not leap on men, <br />
  And unknown powers emerge from Nature&#8217;s sleep? <br />
  Even now hints of a luminous Truth like stars <br />
  Arise in the mind-mooned splendour of Ignorance; <br />
  Even now the deathless Lover&#8217;s touch we feel: <br />
  If the chamber&#8217;s door is even a little ajar, <br />
  What then can hinder God from stealing in <br />
  Or who forbid his kiss on the sleeping soul? <br />
  Already God is near, the Truth is close: <br />
  Because the dark atheist body knows him not, <br />
  Must the sage deny the Light, the seer his soul? <br />
  I am not bound by thought or sense or shape; <br />
  I live in the glory of the Infinite, <br />
  I am near to the Nameless and Unknowable, <br />
  The Ineffable is now my household mate. <br />
  But standing on Eternity&#8217;s luminous brink <br />
  I have discovered that the world was He; <br />
  I have met Spirit with spirit, Self with self, <br />
  But I have loved too the body of my God. <br />
  I have pursued him in his earthly form. <br />

  As if beneath its weight of sterile law <br />
  Oppressed by its own obstinate meaningless will, <br />
  Disdainful, weary and compassionate, <br />
  It kept no more its old intolerant sound, <br />
  But seemed like life&#8217;s in her unnumbered paths <br />
  Toiling for ever and achieving nought <br />
  Because of birth and change, her mortal powers <br />
  By which she lasts, around the term-posts fixed</p>

  Whose course for ever speeds and is the same. <br />
  In its long play with Fate and Chance and Time <br />
  Assured of the game&#8217;s vanity lost or won, <br />
  Crushed by its load of ignorance and doubt <br />
  Which knowledge seems to increase and growth to enlarge, <br />
  The earth-mind sinks and it despairs and looks <br />
  Old, weary and discouraged on its work. <br />
  Yet was all nothing then or vainly achieved? <br />
  Some great thing has been done, some light, some power <br />
  Delivered from the huge Inconscient&#8217;s grasp: <br />
  It has emerged from night; it sees its dawns <br />
  Circling for ever though no dawn can stay. <br />
  This change was in the godhead&#8217;s far-flung voice; <br />
  His form of dread was altered and admitted <br />
  Our transient effort at eternity, <br />
  Yet flung vast doubts of what might else have been <br />
  On grandiose hints of an impossible day. <br />
  The great voice surging cried to Savitri: <br />
  &#8220;Because thou knowst the wisdom that transcends <br />
  Both veil of forms and the contempt of forms, <br />
  Arise delivered by the seeing gods. <br />
  If free thou hadst kept thy mind from life&#8217;s fierce stress, <br />
  Thou mightst have been like them omniscient, calm. <br />
  But the violent and passionate heart forbids. <br />
  It is the storm bird of an anarch Power <br />
  That would upheave the world and tear from it <br />
  The indecipherable scroll of Fate, <br />
  Death&#8217;s rule and Law and the unknowable Will. <br />
  Hasteners to action, violators of God <br />
  Are these great spirits who have too much love, <br />
  And they who formed like thee, for both art thou, <br />
  Have come into the narrow bounds of life <br />
  With too large natures overleaping time. <br />
  Worshippers of force who know not her recoil, <br />
  Their giant wills compel the troubled years.</p>

  Rise ceaselessly towards their unreached sky, <br />
  Seated on their unchanging base, their heads <br />
  Dreamless in heaven&#8217;s immutable domain. <br />
  On their aspiring tops, sublime and still, <br />
  Lifting half-way to heaven the climbing soul <br />
  The mighty mediators stand content <br />

  Motionlessly moving with the might of earth, <br />
  They see the ages pass and are the same. <br />
  The wise think with the cycles, they hear the tread <br />

  Their dangerous wisdom in their depths restrained, <br />
  Lest man&#8217;s frail days into the unknown should sink <br />
  Dragged like a ship by bound leviathan <br />

  Lo, how all shakes when the gods tread too near! <br />
  All moves, is in peril, anguished, torn, upheaved. <br />

  Sanctions and consecrates his nature&#8217;s choice, <br />
  The heart&#8217;s wish donning knowledge as its robe, <br />
  The cherished idea elect among the elect, <br />
  Thought&#8217;s favourite mid the children of half-light <br />
  Who high-voiced crowd the playgrounds of the mind <br />
  Or people its dormitories in infant sleep? <br />
  All things hang here between God&#8217;s yes and no,</p>

<p>Two Powers real but to each other untrue, <br />
  Two consort stars in the mooned night of mind <br />
  That towards two opposite horizons gaze, <br />
  The white head and black tail of the mystic drake, <br />
  The swift and the lame foot, wing strong, wing broken <br />
  Sustaining the body of the uncertain world, <br />
  A great surreal dragon in the skies. <br />
  Too dangerously thy high proud truth must live <br />
  Entangled in Matter&#8217;s mortal littleness. <br />
  All in this world is true, yet all is false: <br />
  Its thoughts into an eternal cipher run, <br />
  Its deeds swell to Time&#8217;s rounded zero sum. <br />
  Thus man at once is animal and god, <br />
  A disparate enigma of God&#8217;s make <br />
  Unable to free the Godhead&#8217;s form within, <br />
  A being less than himself, yet something more, <br />
  The aspiring animal, the frustrate god <br />
  Yet neither beast nor deity but man, <br />
  But man tied to the kind earth&#8217;s labour strives to exceed <br />
  Climbing the stairs of God to higher things. <br />
  Objects are seemings and none knows their truth, <br />
  Ideas are guesses of an ignorant god. <br />
  Truth has no home in earth&#8217;s irrational breast: <br />
  Yet without reason life is a tangle of dreams, <br />
  But reason is poised above a dim abyss <br />
  And stands at last upon a plank of doubt. <br />
  Eternal truth lives not with mortal men. <br />
  Or if she dwells within thy mortal heart, <br />
  Show me the body of the living Truth <br />
  Or draw for me the outline of her face <br />
  That I too may obey and worship her. <br />
  Then will I give thee back thy Satyavan. <br />
  But here are only facts and steel-bound Law. <br />
  This truth I know that Satyavan is dead <br />
  And even thy sweetness cannot lure him back. <br />
  No magic Truth can bring the dead to life,</p>

<p>No power of earth cancel the thing once done, <br />
  No joy of the heart can last surviving death, <br />
  No bliss persuade the past to live again. <br />
  But Life alone can solace the mute Void <br />
  And fill with thought the emptiness of Time. <br />
  Leave then thy dead, O Savitri, and live.&#8221; <br />
  The Woman answered to the mighty Shade, <br />
  And as she spoke, mortality disappeared; <br />
  Her Goddess self grew visible in her eyes, <br />
  Light came, a dream of heaven, into her face. <br />
  &#8220;O Death, thou too art God and yet not He, <br />
  But only his own black shadow on his path <br />
  As leaving the Night he takes the upward Way <br />
  And drags with him its clinging inconscient Force. <br />
  Of God unconscious thou art the dark head, <br />
  Of his Ignorance thou art the impenitent sign, <br />
  Of its vast tenebrous womb the natural child, <br />
  On his immortality the sinister bar. <br />
  All contraries are aspects of God&#8217;s face. <br />
  The Many are the innumerable One, <br />
  The One carries the multitude in his breast; <br />
  He is the Impersonal, inscrutable, sole, <br />
  He is the one infinite Person seeing his world; <br />
  The Silence bears the Eternal&#8217;s great dumb seal, <br />
  His light inspires the eternal Word; <br />
  He is the Immobile&#8217;s deep and deathless hush, <br />
  Its white and signless blank negating calm, <br />
  Yet stands the creator Self, the almighty Lord <br />
  And watches his will done by the forms of Gods <br />
  And the desire that goads half-conscious man <br />
  And the reluctant and unseeing Night. <br />
  These wide divine extremes, these inverse powers <br />
  Are the right and left side of the body of God; <br />
  Existence balanced twixt two mighty arms <br />
  Confronts the mind with unsolved abysms of Thought. <br />
  Darkness below, a fathomless Light above,</p>

<p>In Light are joined, but sundered by severing Mind <br />
  Stand face to face, opposite, inseparable, <br />
  Two contraries needed for his great World-task, <br />
  Two poles whose currents wake the immense World-Force. <br />
  In the stupendous secrecy of his Self, <br />
  Above the world brooding with equal wings, <br />
  He is both in one, beginningless, without end: <br />
  Transcending both, he enters the Absolute. <br />
  His being is a mystery beyond mind, <br />
  His ways bewilder mortal ignorance; <br />
  The finite in its little sections parked, <br />
  Amazed, credits not God&#8217;s audacity <br />
  Who dares to be the unimagined All <br />
  And see and act as might one Infinite. <br />
  Against human reason this is his offence, <br />
  Being known to be for ever unknowable, <br />
  To be all and yet transcend the mystic whole, <br />
  Absolute, to lodge in a relative world of Time, <br />
  Eternal and all-knowing, to suffer birth, <br />
  Omnipotent, to sport with Chance and Fate, <br />
  Spirit, yet to be Matter and the Void, <br />
  Illimitable, beyond form or name, <br />
  To dwell within a body, one and supreme <br />
  To be animal and human and divine: <br />
  A still deep sea, he laughs in rolling waves; <br />
  Universal, he is all,&#8211;transcendent, none. <br />
  To man&#8217;s righteousness this is his cosmic crime, <br />
  Almighty beyond good and evil to dwell <br />
  Leaving the good to their fate in a wicked world <br />
  And evil to reign in this enormous scene. <br />
  All opposition seems and strife and chance, <br />
  An aimless labour with but scanty sense, <br />
  To eyes that see a part and miss the whole; <br />
  The surface men scan, the depths refuse their search: <br />
  A hybrid mystery challenges the view, <br />
  Or a discouraging sordid miracle.</p>

<p>Yet in the exact Inconscient&#8217;s stark conceit, <br />
  In the casual error of the world&#8217;s ignorance <br />
  A plan, a hidden Intelligence is glimpsed. <br />
  There is a purpose in each stumble and fall; <br />
  Nature&#8217;s most careless lolling is a pose <br />
  Preparing some forward step, some deep result. <br />
  Ingenious notes plugged into a motived score, <br />
  These million discords dot the harmonious theme <br />
  Of the evolution&#8217;s huge orchestral dance. <br />
  A Truth supreme has forced the world to be; <br />
  It has wrapped itself in Matter as in a shroud, <br />
  A shroud of Death, a shroud of Ignorance. <br />
  It compelled the suns to burn through silent Space, <br />
  Flame-signs of its uncomprehended Thought <br />
  In a wide brooding ether&#8217;s formless muse: <br />
  It made of Knowledge a veiled and struggling light, <br />
  Of Being a substance nescient, dense and dumb, <br />
  Of Bliss the beauty of an insentient world. <br />
  In finite things the conscious Infinite dwells: <br />
  Involved it sleeps in Matter&#8217;s helpless trance, <br />
  It rules the world from its sleeping senseless Void; <br />
  Dreaming it throws out mind and heart and soul <br />
  To labour crippled, bound, on the hard earth; <br />
  A broken whole it works through scattered points; <br />
  Its gleaming shards are Wisdom&#8217;s diamond thoughts, <br />
  Its shadowy reflex our ignorance. <br />
  It starts from the mute mass in countless jets, <br />
  It fashions a being out of brain and nerve, <br />
  A sentient creature from its pleasures and pangs. <br />
  A pack of feelings obscure, a dot of sense <br />
  Survives awhile answering the shocks of life, <br />
  Then, crushed or its force spent, leaves the dead form, <br />
  Leaves the huge universe in which it lived <br />
  An insignificant unconsidered guest. <br />
  But the soul grows concealed within its house; <br />
  It gives to the body its strength and magnificence;</p>

<p>It follows aims in an ignorant aimless world, <br />
  It lends significance to earth&#8217;s meaningless life. <br />
  A demigod animal, came thinking man; <br />
  He wallows in mud, yet heavenward soars in thought; <br />
  He plays and ponders, laughs and weeps and dreams, <br />
  Satisfies his little longings like the beast; <br />
  He pores upon life&#8217;s book with student eyes. <br />
  Out of this tangle of intellect and sense, <br />
  Out of the narrow scope of finite thought <br />

  A high liberty begins and luminous room: <br />
  He glimpses eternity, touches the infinite, <br />
  He meets the gods in great and sudden hours, <br />
  He feels the universe as his larger self, <br />
  Makes Space and Time his opportunity <br />
  To join the heights and depths of being in light, <br />
  In the heart&#8217;s cave speaks secretly with God. <br />
  But these are touches and high moments lived; <br />
  Fragments of Truth supreme have lit his soul, <br />
  Reflections of the sun in waters still. <br />
  A few have dared the last supreme ascent <br />
  And break through borders of blinding light above, <br />
  And feel a breath around of mightier air, <br />
  Receive a vaster being&#8217;s messages <br />
  And bathe in its immense intuitive Ray. <br />
  On summit Mind are radiant altitudes <br />
  Exposed to the lustre of Infinity, <br />
  Outskirts and dependencies of the house of Truth, <br />
  Upraised estates of Mind and measureless. <br />
  There man can visit but there he cannot live. <br />
  A cosmic Thought spreads out its vastitudes; <br />
  Its smallest parts are here philosophies <br />
  Challenging with their detailed immensity, <br />
  Each figuring an omniscient scheme of things. <br />
  But higher still can climb the ascending light; <br />
  There are vasts of vision and eternal suns,</p>

  Ideas are phalanxed like a group of suns, <br />
  Each marshalling his company of rays. <br />
  Thought crowds in masses seized by one regard; <br />
  All Time is one body, Space a single look: <br />
  There is the Godhead&#8217;s universal gaze <br />
  And there the boundaries of immortal Mind:</p>

  Or who could hope to bring her down to men <br />
  And persuade to tread the harsh globe with wounded feet <br />
  Leaving her unapproachable glory and bliss, <br />
  Wasting her splendour on pale earthly air? <br />
  Is thine that strength, O beauty of mortal limbs, <br />
  O soul who flutterest to escape my net? <br />

<p>And all wide space was but its outer robe. <br />
  A curve of the calm hauteur of far heaven <br />
  Descending into earth&#8217;s humility, <br />
  Her forehead&#8217;s span vaulted the Omniscient&#8217;s gaze, <br />
  Her eyes were two stars that watched the universe. <br />
  The Power that from her being&#8217;s summit reigned, <br />
  The Presence chambered in lotus secrecy, <br />
  Came down and held the centre in her brow <br />
  Where the mind&#8217;s Lord in his control-room sits; <br />
  There throned on concentration&#8217;s native seat <br />
  He opens that third mysterious eye in man, <br />
  The Unseen&#8217;s eye that looks at the unseen, <br />
  When Light with a golden ecstasy fills his brain <br />
  And the Eternal&#8217;s wisdom drives his choice <br />
  And eternal Will seizes the mortal&#8217;s will. <br />
  It stirred in the lotus of her throat of song, <br />
  And in her speech throbbed the immortal Word, <br />
  Her life sounded with the steps of the world-soul <br />
  Moving in harmony with the cosmic Thought. <br />
  As glides God&#8217;s sun into the mystic cave <br />
  Where hides his light from the pursuing gods, <br />
  It glided into the lotus of her heart <br />
  And woke in it the Force that alters Fate. <br />
  It poured into her navel&#8217;s lotus depth, <br />
  Lodged in the little life-nature&#8217;s narrow home, <br />
  On the body&#8217;s longings grew heaven-rapture&#8217;s flower <br />
  And made desire a pure celestial flame, <br />
  Broke into the cave where coiled World-Energy sleeps <br />
  And smote the thousand-hooded serpent Force <br />
  That blazing towered and clasped the World-Self above, <br />
  Joined Matter&#8217;s dumbness to the Spirit&#8217;s hush <br />
  And filled earth&#8217;s acts with the Spirit&#8217;s silent power. <br />
  Thus changed she waited for the Word to speak. <br />
  Eternity looked into the eyes of Death <br />
  And Darkness saw God&#8217;s living Reality. <br />
  Then a Voice was heard that seemed the stillness&#8217; self</p>

<p>Or the low calm utterance of infinity <br />
  When it speaks to the silence in the heart of sleep. <br />
  &#8220;I hail thee, almighty and victorious Death, <br />
  Thou grandiose Darkness of the Infinite. <br />
  O Void that makest room for all to be, <br />
  Hunger that gnawest at the universe <br />
  Consuming the cold remnants of the suns <br />
  And eatst the whole world with thy jaws of fire, <br />
  Waster of the energy that has made the stars, <br />
  Inconscience, carrier of the seeds of thought, <br />
  Nescience in which All-Knowledge sleeps entombed <br />
  And slowly emerges in its hollow breast <br />
  Wearing the mind&#8217;s mask of bright Ignorance. <br />
  Thou art my shadow and my instrument. <br />
  I have given thee thy awful shape of dread <br />
  And thy sharp sword of terror and grief and pain <br />
  To force the soul of man to struggle for light <br />
  On the brevity of his half-conscious days. <br />
  Thou art his spur to greatness in his works, <br />
  The whip to his yearning for eternal bliss, <br />
  His poignant need of immortality. <br />
  Live, Death, awhile, be still my instrument. <br />
  One day man too shall know thy fathomless heart <br />
  Of silence and the brooding peace of Night <br />
  And grave obedience to eternal Law <br />
  And the calm inflexible pity in thy gaze. <br />
  But now, O timeless Mightiness, stand aside <br />
  And leave the path of my incarnate Force. <br />
  Relieve the radiant God from thy black mask: <br />
  Release the soul of the world called Satyavan <br />
  Freed from thy clutch of pain and ignorance <br />
  That he may stand master of life and fate, <br />
  Man&#8217;s representative in the house of God, <br />
  The mate of Wisdom and the spouse of Light, <br />
  The eternal bridegroom of the eternal bride.&#8221; <br />
  She spoke; Death unconvinced resisted still,</p>

<p>Although he knew refusing still to know, <br />
  Although he saw refusing still to see. <br />
  Unshakable he stood claiming his right. <br />
  His spirit bowed; his will obeyed the law <br />
  Of its own nature binding even on Gods. <br />
  The Two opposed each other face to face. <br />
  His being like a huge fort of darkness towered; <br />
  Around it her light grew, an ocean&#8217;s siege. <br />
  Awhile the Shade survived defying heaven: <br />
  Assailing in front, oppressing from above, <br />
  A concrete mass of conscious power, he bore <br />
  The tyranny of her divine desire. <br />
  A pressure of intolerable force <br />
  Weighed on his unbowed head and stubborn breast; <br />
  Light like a burning tongue licked up his thoughts, <br />
  Light was a luminous torture in his heart, <br />
  Light coursed, a splendid agony, through his nerves; <br />
  His darkness muttered perishing in her blaze. <br />
  Her mastering Word commanded every limb <br />
  And left no room for his enormous will <br />
  That seemed pushed out into some helpless space <br />
  And could no more re-enter but left him void. <br />
  He called to Night but she fell shuddering back, <br />
  He called to Hell but sullenly it retired: <br />
  He turned to the Inconscient for support, <br />
  From which he was born, his vast sustaining self; <br />
  It drew him back towards boundless vacancy <br />
  As if by himself to swallow up himself: <br />
  He called to his strength, but it refused his call. <br />
  His body was eaten by light, his spirit devoured. <br />
  At last he knew defeat inevitable <br />
  And left crumbling the shape that he had worn, <br />
  Abandoning hope to make man&#8217;s soul his prey <br />
  And force to be mortal the immortal spirit. <br />
  Afar he fled shunning her dreaded touch <br />
  And refuge took in the retreating Night.</p>

  The dire universal Shadow disappeared <br />
  Vanishing into the Void from which it came. <br />
  As if deprived of its original cause, <br />
  The twilight realm passed fading from their souls, <br />
  And Satyavan and Savitri were alone. <br />

  A mute invisible and translucent wall. <br />
