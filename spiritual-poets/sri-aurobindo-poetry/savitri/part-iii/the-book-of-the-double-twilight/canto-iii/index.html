<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A sad destroying cadence the voice sank; <br />
  It seemed to lead the advancing march of Life <br />
  Into some still original Inane. <br />
  But Savitri answered to almighty Death: <br />
  &#8220;O dark-browed sophist of the universe <br />
  Who veilst the Real with its own Idea, <br />
  Hiding with brute objects Nature&#8217;s living face, <br />
  Masking eternity with thy dance of death, <br />
  Thou hast woven the ignorant mind into a screen <br />
  And made of Thought error&#8217;s purveyor and scribe, <br />
  And a false witness of mind&#8217;s servant sense. <br />
  An aesthete of the sorrow of the world, <br />
  Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy <br />
  Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light <br />
  And called in Truth to vindicate a lie. <br />
  A lying reality is falsehood&#8217;s crown <br />
  And a perverted truth her richest gem. <br />
  O Death, thou speakest truth but truth that slays, <br />
  I answer to thee with the Truth that saves. <br />
  A traveller new-discovering himself, <br />
  One made of Matter&#8217;s world his starting-point, <br />
  He made of Nothingness his living-room <br />
  And Night a process of the eternal light <br />
  And death a spur towards immortality. <br />
  God wrapped his head from sight in Matter&#8217;s cowl, <br />
  His consciousness dived into inconscient depths, <br />
  All-Knowledge seemed a huge dark Nescience; <br />
  Infinity wore a boundless zero&#8217;s form. <br />
  His abysms of bliss became insensible deeps, <br />
  Eternity a blank spiritual Vast. <br />
  Annulling an original nullity

<p>The Timeless took its ground in emptiness <br />
  And drew the figure of a universe, <br />
  That the spirit might adventure into Time <br />
  And wrestle with adamant Necessity <br />
  And the soul pursue a cosmic pilgrimage. <br />
  A spirit moved in black immensities <br />
  And built a Thought in ancient Nothingness; <br />
  A soul was lit in God&#8217;s tremendous Void, <br />
  A secret labouring glow of nascent fire. <br />
  In Nihil&#8217;s gulf his mighty Puissance wrought; <br />
  She swung her formless motion into shapes, <br />
  Made Matter the body of the Bodiless. <br />
  Infant and dim the eternal Mights awoke. <br />
  In inert Matter breathed a slumbering Life, <br />
  In a subconscient Life Mind lay asleep; <br />
  In waking Life it stretched its giant limbs <br />
  To shake from it the torpor of its drowse; <br />
  A senseless substance quivered into sense, <br />
  The world&#8217;s heart commenced to beat, its eyes to see, <br />
  In the crowded dumb vibrations of a brain <br />
  Thought fumbled in a ring to find itself, <br />
  Discovered speech and fed the new-born Word <br />
  That bridged with spans of light the world&#8217;s ignorance. <br />
  In waking Mind, the Thinker built his house. <br />
  A reasoning animal willed and planned and sought; <br />
  He stood erect among his brute compeers, <br />
  He built life new, measured the universe, <br />
  Opposed his fate and wrestled with unseen Powers, <br />
  Conquered and used the laws that rule the world, <br />
  And hoped to ride the heavens and reach the stars, <br />
  A master of his huge environment. <br />
  Now through Mind&#8217;s windows stares the demigod <br />
  Hidden behind the curtains of man&#8217;s soul: <br />
  He has seen the Unknown, looked on Truth&#8217;s veilless face; <br />
  A ray has touched him from the eternal sun; <br />
  Motionless, voiceless in foreseeing depths,</p>

<p>He stands awake in Supernature&#8217;s light <br />
  And sees a glory of arisen wings <br />
  And sees the vast descending might of God. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;O Death, thou lookst on an unfinished world <br />
  Assailed by thee and of its road unsure, <br />
  Peopled by imperfect minds and ignorant lives, <br />
  And sayest God is not and all is vain. <br />
  How shall the child already be the man? <br />
  Because he is infant, shall he never grow? <br />
  Because he is ignorant, shall he never learn? <br />
  In a small fragile seed a great tree lurks, <br />
  In a tiny gene a thinking being is shut; <br />
  A little element in a little sperm, <br />
  It grows and is a conqueror and a sage. <br />
  Then wilt thou spew out, Death, God&#8217;s mystic truth, <br />
  Deny the occult spiritual miracle? <br />
  Still wilt thou say there is no spirit, no God? <br />
  A mute material Nature wakes and sees; <br />
  She has invented speech, unveiled a will. <br />
  Something there waits beyond towards which she strives, <br />
  Something surrounds her into which she grows: <br />
  To uncover the spirit, to change back into God, <br />
  To exceed herself is her transcendent task. <br />
  In God concealed the world began to be, <br />
  Tardily it travels towards manifest God: <br />
  Our imperfection towards perfection toils, <br />
  The body is the chrysalis of a soul: <br />
  The infinite holds the finite in its arms, <br />
  Time travels towards revealed eternity. <br />
  A miracle structure of the eternal Mage, <br />
  Matter its mystery hides from its own eyes, <br />
  A scripture written out in cryptic signs, <br />
  An occult document of the All-Wonderful&#8217;s art. <br />
  All here bears witness to his secret might, <br />
  In all we feel his presence and his power. <br />
  A blaze of his sovereign glory is the sun,</p>

<p>A glory is the gold and glimmering moon, <br />
  A glory is his dream of purple sky. <br />
  A march of his greatness are the wheeling stars. <br />
  His laughter of beauty breaks out in green trees, <br />
  His moments of beauty triumph in a flower; <br />
  The blue sea&#8217;s chant, the rivulet&#8217;s wandering voice <br />

  By means we slight as small, obscure or base, <br />
  A greatness founded upon little things, <br />
  He has built a world in the unknowing Void. <br />
  His forms he has massed from infinitesimal dust; <br />
  His marvels are built from insignificant things. <br />
  If mind is crippled, life untaught and crude, <br />
  If brutal masks are there and evil acts, <br />
  They are incidents of his vast and varied plot, <br />
  His great and dangerous drama&#8217;s needed steps; <br />
  He makes with these and all his passion-play, <br />
  A play and yet no play but the deep scheme <br />
  Of a transcendent Wisdom finding ways <br />
  To meet her Lord in the shadow and the Night: <br />
  Above her is the vigil of the stars; <br />
  Watched by a solitary Infinitude <br />
  She embodies in dumb Matter the Divine, <br />
  In symbol minds and lives the Absolute. <br />
  A miracle-monger her mechanical craft; <br />
  Matter&#8217;s machine worked out the laws of thought, <br />
  Life&#8217;s engines served the labour of a soul: <br />
  The Mighty Mother her creation wrought, <br />
  A huge caprice self-bound by iron laws, <br />
  And shut God into an enigmatic world: <br />
  She lulled the Omniscient into nescient sleep, <br />
  Omnipotence on Inertia&#8217;s back she drove, <br />
  Trod perfectly with divine unconscious steps</p>

<p>The enormous circle of her wonder-works. <br />
  Immortality assured itself by death; <br />
  The Eternal&#8217;s face was seen through drifts of Time. <br />
  His knowledge he disguised as Ignorance, <br />
  His Good he sowed in Evil&#8217;s monstrous bed, <br />
  Made error a door by which Truth could enter in, <br />
  His plant of bliss watered with Sorrow&#8217;s tears. <br />
  A thousand aspects point back to the One; <br />
  A dual Nature covered the Unique. <br />
  In this meeting of the Eternal&#8217;s mingling masques, <br />
  This tangle-dance of passionate contraries <br />
  Locking like lovers in a forbidden embrace <br />
  The quarrel of their lost identity, <br />
  Through this wrestle and wrangle of the extremes of Power <br />
  Earth&#8217;s million roads struggled towards deity. <br />
  All stumbled on behind a stumbling Guide, <br />
  Yet every stumble is a needed pace <br />
  On unknown routes to an unknowable goal. <br />
  All blundered and straggled towards the One Divine. <br />
  As if transmuted by a titan spell <br />
  The eternal Powers assumed a dubious face: <br />
  Idols of an oblique divinity, <br />
  They wore the heads of animal or troll, <br />
  Assumed ears of the faun, the satyr&#8217;s hoof, <br />
  Or harboured the demoniac in their gaze: <br />
  A crooked maze they made of thinking mind, <br />
  They suffered a metamorphosis of the heart, <br />
  Admitting bacchant revellers from the Night <br />
  Into its sanctuary of delights, <br />
  As in a Dionysian masquerade. <br />
  On the highways, in the gardens of the world <br />
  They wallowed oblivious of their divine parts, <br />
  As drunkards of a dire Circean wine <br />
  Or a child who sprawls and sports in Nature&#8217;s mire. <br />
  Even wisdom, hewer of the roads of God, <br />
  Is a partner in the deep disastrous game:</p>

  Safe from the little sounding leads of mind, <br />
  Too far for the puny diver&#8217;s shallow plunge. <br />
  Our mortal vision peers with ignorant eyes; <br />

  Our knowledge walks leaning on Error&#8217;s staff, <br />
  A worshipper of false dogmas and false gods, <br />
  Or fanatic of a fierce intolerant creed <br />
  Or a seeker doubting every truth he finds, <br />
  A sceptic facing Light with adamant No <br />
  Or chilling the heart with dry ironic smile, <br />
  A cynic stamping out the god in man; <br />
  A darkness wallows in the paths of Time <br />
  Or lifts its giant head to blot the stars; <br />
  It makes a cloud of the interpreting mind <br />
  And intercepts the oracles of the Sun. <br />
  Yet Light is there; it stands at Nature&#8217;s doors: <br />
  It holds a torch to lead the traveller in. <br />
  It waits to be kindled in our secret cells; <br />
  It is a star lighting an ignorant sea, <br />
  A lamp upon our poop piercing the night. <br />
  As knowledge grows Light flames up from within: <br />
  It is a shining warrior in the mind, <br />
  An eagle of dreams in the divining heart, <br />
  An armour in the fight, a bow of God. <br />
  Then larger dawns arrive and Wisdom&#8217;s pomps</p>

  Whose fire burns in the eyes of seer and sage; <br />
  A lightning flash of visionary sight, <br />
  It plays upon an inward verge of mind: <br />
  Thought silenced gazes into a brilliant Void. <br />
  A voice comes down from mystic unseen peaks: <br />
  A cry of splendour from a mouth of storm, <br />
  It is the voice that speaks to night&#8217;s profound, <br />
  It is the thunder and the flaming call. <br />
  Above the planes that climb from nescient earth, <br />
  A hand is lifted towards the Invisible&#8217;s realm, <br />
  Beyond the superconscient&#8217;s blinding line <br />

  It hears the Word to which our hearts were deaf, <br />
  It sees through the blaze in which our thoughts grew blind; <br />
  It drinks from the naked breasts of glorious Truth, <br />
  It learns the secrets of eternity. <br />
  Thus all was plunged into the riddling Night, <br />
  Thus all is raised to meet a dazzling Sun. <br />
  O Death, this is the mystery of thy reign. <br />
  In earth&#8217;s anomalous and magic field <br />
  Carried in its aimless journey by the sun <br />
  Mid the forced marches of the great dumb stars, <br />
  A darkness occupied the fields of God, <br />
  And Matter&#8217;s world was governed by thy shape.</p>

<p>Thy mask has covered the Eternal&#8217;s face, <br />
  The Bliss that made the world has fallen asleep. <br />
  Abandoned in the Vast she slumbered on: <br />
  An evil transmutation overtook <br />
  Her members till she knew herself no more. <br />
  Only through her creative slumber flit <br />
  Frail memories of the joy and beauty meant <br />
  Under the sky&#8217;s blue laugh mid green-scarfed trees <br />
  And happy squanderings of scents and hues, <br />
  In the field of the golden promenade of the sun <br />
  And the vigil of the dream-light of the stars, <br />
  Amid high meditating heads of hills, <br />
  On the bosom of voluptuous rain-kissed earth <br />
  And by the sapphire tumblings of the sea. <br />
  But now the primal innocence is lost <br />
  And Death and Ignorance govern the mortal world <br />
  And Nature&#8217;s visage wears a greyer hue. <br />
  Earth still has kept her early charm and grace, <br />
  The grandeur and the beauty still are hers, <br />
  But veiled is the divine Inhabitant. <br />
  The souls of men have wandered from the Light <br />
  And the great Mother turns away her face. <br />
  The eyes of the creatrix Bliss are closed <br />
  And sorrow&#8217;s touch has found her in her dreams. <br />
  As she turns and tosses on her bed of Void, <br />
  Because she cannot wake and find herself <br />
  And cannot build again her perfect shape, <br />
  Oblivious of her nature and her state, <br />
  Forgetting her instinct of felicity, <br />
  Forgetting to create a world of joy, <br />
  She weeps and makes her creatures&#8217; eyes to weep; <br />
  Testing with sorrow&#8217;s edge her children&#8217;s breasts, <br />
  She spends on life&#8217;s vain waste of hope and toil <br />
  The poignant luxury of grief and tears. <br />

  Tortured herself and torturing by her touch,</p>

  Wearing a hard and cruel mask of pain. <br />
  Our nature twisted by the abortive birth <br />
  Returns wry answers to life&#8217;s questioning shocks, <br />
  An acrid relish finds in the world&#8217;s pangs, <br />
  Drinks the sharp wine of grief&#8217;s perversity. <br />
  A curse is laid on the pure joy of life: <br />
  Delight, God&#8217;s sweetest sign and Beauty&#8217;s twin, <br />
  Dreaded by aspiring saint and austere sage, <br />
  Is shunned, a dangerous and ambiguous cheat, <br />
  A specious trick of an infernal Power <br />
  It tempts the soul to its self-hurt and fall. <br />
  A puritan God made pleasure a poisonous fruit, <br />
  Or red drug in the market-place of Death, <br />
  And sin the child of Nature&#8217;s ecstasy. <br />
  Yet every creature hunts for happiness, <br />
  Buys with harsh pangs or tears by violence <br />
  From the dull breast of the inanimate globe <br />
  Some fragment or some broken shard of bliss. <br />
  Even joy itself becomes a poisonous draught; <br />
  Its hunger is made a dreadful hook of Fate. <br />
  All means are held good to catch a single beam, <br />
  Eternity sacrificed for a moment&#8217;s bliss: <br />
  Yet for joy and not for sorrow earth was made <br />
  And not as a dream in endless suffering Time. <br />
  Although God made the world for his delight, <br />
  An ignorant Power took charge and seemed his Will <br />
  And Death&#8217;s deep falsity has mastered Life. <br />
  All grew a play of Chance simulating Fate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;A secret air of pure felicity <br />
  Deep like a sapphire heaven our spirits breathe; <br />
  Our hearts and bodies feel its obscure call, <br />
  Our senses grope for it and touch and lose. <br />
  If this withdrew, the world would sink in the Void; <br />
  If this were not, nothing could move or live.</p>

<p>A hidden Bliss is at the root of things. <br />
  A mute Delight regards Time&#8217;s countless works: <br />
  To house God&#8217;s joy in things Space gave wide room, <br />
  To house God&#8217;s joy in self our souls were born. <br />
  This universe an old enchantment guards; <br />
  Its objects are carved cups of World-Delight <br />
  Whose charmed wine is some deep soul&#8217;s rapture-drink: <br />
  The All-Wonderful has packed heaven with his dreams, <br />
  He has made blank ancient Space his marvel-house; <br />
  He spilled his spirit into Matter&#8217;s signs: <br />
  His fires of grandeur burn in the great sun, <br />
  He glides through heaven shimmering in the moon; <br />
  He is beauty carolling in the fields of sound; <br />
  He chants the stanzas of the odes of Wind; <br />
  He is silence watching in the stars at night; <br />
  He wakes at dawn and calls from every bough, <br />
  Lies stunned in the stone and dreams in flower and tree. <br />
  Even in this labour and dolour of Ignorance, <br />
  On the hard perilous ground of difficult earth, <br />
  In spite of death and evil circumstance <br />
  A will to live persists, a joy to be. <br />
  There is a joy in all that meets the sense, <br />
  A joy in all experience of the soul, <br />
  A joy in evil and a joy in good, <br />
  A joy in virtue and a joy in sin: <br />
  Indifferent to the threat of Karmic law, <br />
  Joy dares to grow upon forbidden soil, <br />
  Its sap runs through the plant and flowers of Pain: <br />
  It thrills with the drama of fate and tragic doom, <br />
  It tears its food from sorrow and ecstasy, <br />
  On danger and difficulty whets its strength; <br />
  It wallows with the reptile and the worm <br />
  And lifts its head, an equal of the stars; <br />
  It shares the faeries&#8217; dance, dines with the gnome: <br />
  It basks in the light and heat of many suns, <br />
  The sun of Beauty and the sun of Power</p>

  And dim fragments of the glory of Paradise. <br />

  But not for ever endures this danger game: <br />
  Beyond the earth, but meant for delivered earth, <br />
  Wisdom and joy prepare their perfect crown; <br />
  Truth superhuman calls to thinking man. <br />
  At last the soul turns to eternal things, <br />
  In every shrine it cries for the clasp of God. <br />
  Then is there played the crowning Mystery, <br />
  Then is achieved the longed-for miracle.</p>

  A made-up self in a constructed world. <br />
  Thy words are large murmurs in a mystic dream. <br />
  For how in the soiled heart of man could dwell <br />
  The immaculate grandeur of thy dream-built God, <br />
  Or who can see a face and form divine <br />
  In the naked two-legged worm thou callest man? <br />
  O human face, put off mind-painted masks: <br />
  The animal be, the worm that Nature meant; <br />
  Accept thy futile birth, thy narrow life. <br />
  For truth is bare like stone and hard like death; <br />
  Bare in the bareness, hard with truth&#8217;s hardness live.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied to the dire God: <br />
  &#8220;Yes, I am human. Yet shall man by me, <br />
  Since in humanity waits his hour the God, <br />
  Trample thee down to reach the immortal heights, <br />
  Transcending grief and pain and fate and death. <br />
  Yes, my humanity is a mask of God: <br />
  He dwells in me, the mover of my acts, <br />
  Turning the great wheel of his cosmic work. <br />
  I am the living body of his light, <br />
  I am the thinking instrument of his power, <br />
  I incarnate Wisdom in an earthly breast, <br />
  I am his conquering and unslayable will. <br />
  The formless Spirit drew in me its shape; <br />
  In me are the Nameless and the secret Name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Death from the incredulous Darkness sent its cry: <br />
  &#8220;O priestess in Imagination&#8217;s house, <br />
  Persuade first Nature&#8217;s fixed immutable laws <br />
  And make the impossible thy daily work. <br />
  How canst thou force to wed two eternal foes? <br />
  Irreconcilable in their embrace <br />
  They cancel the glory of their pure extremes: <br />
  An unhappy wedlock maims their stunted force. <br />
  How shall thy will make one the true and false? <br />
  Where Matter is all, there Spirit is a dream: <br />
  If all are the Spirit, Matter is a lie, <br />
  And who was the liar who forged the universe? <br />
  The Real with the unreal cannot mate. <br />
  He who would turn to God, must leave the world; <br />
  He who would live in the Spirit, must give up life; <br />
  He who has met the Self, renounces self. <br />
  The voyagers of the million routes of mind <br />
  Who have travelled through Existence to its end, <br />
  Sages exploring the world-ocean&#8217;s vasts, <br />
  Have found extinction the sole harbour safe. <br />
  Two only are the doors of man&#8217;s escape, <br />
  Death of his body Matter&#8217;s gate to peace, <br />
  Death of his soul his last felicity. <br />
  In me all take refuge, for I, Death, am God.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied to mighty Death: <br />
  &#8220;My heart is wiser than the Reason&#8217;s thoughts, <br />
  My heart is stronger than thy bonds, O Death. <br />
  It sees and feels the one Heart beat in all, <br />
  It feels the high Transcendent&#8217;s sunlike hands, <br />
  It sees the cosmic Spirit at its work; <br />
  In the dim Night it lies alone with God. <br />
  My heart&#8217;s strength can carry the grief of the universe <br />
  And never falter from its luminous track, <br />
  Its white tremendous orbit through God&#8217;s peace. <br />
  It can drink up the sea of All-Delight <br />
  And never lose the white spiritual touch,</p>

<p>The calm that broods in the deep Infinite.&#8221; <br />
  He said, &#8220;Art thou indeed so strong, O heart, <br />
  O soul, so free? And canst thou gather then <br />
  Bright pleasure from my wayside flowering boughs, <br />
  Yet falter not from thy hard journey&#8217;s goal, <br />
  Meet the world&#8217;s dangerous touch and never fall? <br />
  Show me thy strength and freedom from my laws.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri answered, &#8220;Surely I shall find <br />
  Among the green and whispering woods of Life <br />
  Close-bosomed pleasures, only mine since his, <br />
  Or mine for him, because our joys are one. <br />
  And if I linger, Time is ours and God&#8217;s, <br />
  And if I fall, is not his hand near mine? <br />
  All is a single plan; each wayside act <br />
  Deepens the soul&#8217;s response, brings nearer the goal.&#8221; <br />
  Death the contemptuous Nihil answered her: <br />
  &#8220;So prove thy absolute force to the wise gods, <br />
  By choosing earthly joy! For self demand <br />
  And yet from self and its gross masks live free. <br />
  Then will I give thee all thy soul desires, <br />
  All the brief joys earth keeps for mortal hearts. <br />
  Only the one dearest wish that outweighs all, <br />
  Hard laws forbid and thy ironic fate. <br />
  My will once wrought remains unchanged through Time, <br />
  And Satyavan can never again be thine.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied to the vague Power: <br />
  &#8220;If the eyes of Darkness can look straight at Truth, <br />
  Look in my heart and, knowing what I am, <br />
  Give what thou wilt or what thou must, O Death. <br />
  Nothing I claim but Satyavan alone.&#8221; <br />
  There was a hush as if of doubtful fates. <br />
  As one disdainful still who yields a point <br />
  Death bowed his sovereign head in cold assent: <br />
  &#8220;I give to thee, saved from death and poignant fate <br />
  Whatever once the living Satyavan <br />
  Desired in his heart for Savitri.</p>

<p>Bright noons I give thee and unwounded dawns, <br />
  Daughters of thy own shape in heart and mind, <br />
  Fair hero sons and sweetness undisturbed <br />
  Of union with thy husband dear and true. <br />
  And thou shalt harvest in thy joyful house <br />
  Felicity of thy surrounded eves. <br />
  Love shall bind by thee many gathered hearts. <br />
  The opposite sweetness in thy days shall meet <br />
  Of tender service to thy life&#8217;s desired <br />
  And loving empire over all thy loved, <br />
  Two poles of bliss made one, O Savitri. <br />
  Return, O child, to thy forsaken earth.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied, &#8220;Thy gifts resist. <br />
  Earth cannot flower if lonely I return.&#8221; <br />
  Then Death sent forth once more his angry cry, <br />
  As chides a lion his escaping prey: <br />
  &#8220;What knowst thou of earth&#8217;s rich and changing life <br />
  Who thinkst that one man dead all joy must cease? <br />
  Hope not to be unhappy till the end: <br />
  For grief dies soon in the tired human heart; <br />
  Soon other guests the empty chambers fill. <br />
  A transient painting on a holiday&#8217;s floor <br />
  Traced for a moment&#8217;s beauty love was made. <br />
  Or if a voyager on the eternal trail, <br />
  Its objects fluent change in its embrace <br />
  Like waves to a swimmer upon infinite seas.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied to the vague god, <br />
  &#8220;Give me back Satyavan, my only lord. <br />
  Thy thoughts are vacant to my soul that feels <br />
  The deep eternal truth in transient things.&#8221; <br />
  Death answered her, &#8220;Return and try thy soul! <br />
  Soon shalt thou find appeased that other men <br />
  On lavish earth have beauty, strength and truth, <br />
  And when thou hast half forgotten, one of these <br />
  Shall wind himself around thy heart that needs <br />
  Some human answering heart against thy breast;</p>

<p>For who, being mortal, can dwell glad alone? <br />
  Then Satyavan shall glide into the past, <br />
  A gentle memory pushed away from thee <br />
  By new love and thy children&#8217;s tender hands, <br />
  Till thou shalt wonder if thou lov&#8217;dst at all. <br />
  Such is the life earth&#8217;s travail has conceived, <br />
  A constant stream that never is the same.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied to mighty Death: <br />
  &#8220;O dark ironic critic of God&#8217;s work, <br />
  Thou mockst the mind and body&#8217;s faltering search <br />
  For what the heart holds in a prophet hour <br />
  And the immortal spirit shall make its own. <br />
  Mine is a heart that worshipped, though forsaken, <br />
  The image of the god its love adored; <br />
  I have burned in flame to travel in his steps. <br />
  Are we not they who bore vast solitude <br />
  Seated upon the hills alone with God? <br />
  Why dost thou vainly strive with me, O Death, <br />
  A mind delivered from all twilight thoughts, <br />
  To whom the secrets of the gods are plain? <br />
  For now at last I know beyond all doubt, <br />
  The great stars burn with my unceasing fire <br />
  And life and death are both its fuel made. <br />
  Life only was my blind attempt to love: <br />
  Earth saw my struggle, heaven my victory; <br />
  All shall be seized, transcended; there shall kiss <br />
  Casting their veils before the marriage fire <br />
  The eternal bridegroom and eternal bride. <br />
  The heavens accept our broken flights at last. <br />
  On our life&#8217;s prow that breaks the waves of Time <br />
  No signal light of hope has gleamed in vain.&#8221; <br />
  She spoke; the boundless members of the god <br />
  As if by secret ecstasy assailed, <br />
  Shuddered in silence as obscurely stir <br />
  Ocean&#8217;s dim fields delivered to the moon. <br />
  Then lifted up as by a sudden wind</p>

<p>Around her in that vague and glimmering world <br />
  The twilight trembled like a bursting veil. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus with armed speech the great opponents strove. <br />
  Around those spirits in the glittering mist <br />
  A deepening half-light fled with pearly wings <br />
  As if to reach some far ideal Morn. <br />
  Outlined her thoughts flew through the gleaming haze <br />
  Mingling bright-pinioned with its lights and veils <br />
  And all her words like dazzling jewels were caught <br />
  Into the glow of a mysterious world, <br />
  Or tricked in the rainbow shifting of its hues <br />
  Like echoes swam fainting into far sound. <br />
  All utterance, all mood must there become <br />
  An unenduring tissue sewn by mind <br />
  To make a gossamer robe of beautiful change. <br />
  Intent upon her silent will she walked <br />
  On the dim grass of vague unreal plains, <br />
  A floating veil of visions in her front, <br />
  A trailing robe of dreams behind her feet. <br />
  But now her spirit&#8217;s flame of conscient force <br />
  Retiring from a sweetness without fruit <br />
  Called back her thoughts from speech to sit within <br />
  In a deep room in meditation&#8217;s house. <br />
  For only there could dwell the soul&#8217;s firm truth: <br />
  Imperishable, a tongue of sacrifice, <br />
  It flamed unquenched upon the central hearth <br />
  Where burns for the high houselord and his mate <br />
  The homestead&#8217;s sentinel and witness fire <br />
  From which the altars of the gods are lit. <br />
  All still compelled went gliding on unchanged, <br />
  Still was the order of these worlds reversed: <br />
  The mortal led, the god and spirit obeyed <br />
  And she behind was leader of their march <br />
  And they in front were followers of her will. <br />
  Onward they journeyed through the drifting ways <br />
  Vaguely companioned by the glimmering mists.</p>
