<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Then pealed the calm inexorable voice: <br />
  Abolishing hope, cancelling life&#8217;s golden truths, <br />
  Fatal its accents smote the trembling air. <br />
  That lovely world swam thin and frail, most like <br />
  Some pearly evanescent farewell gleam <br />
  On the faint verge of dusk in moonless eves. <br />
  &#8220;Prisoner of Nature, many-visioned spirit, <br />
  Thought&#8217;s creature in the ideal&#8217;s realm enjoying <br />
  Thy unsubstantial immortality <br />
  The subtle marvellous mind of man has feigned, <br />
  This is the world from which thy yearnings came. <br />
  When it would build eternity from the dust, <br />
  Man&#8217;s thought paints images illusion rounds; <br />
  Prophesying glories it shall never see, <br />
  It labours delicately among its dreams. <br />
  Behold this fleeing of light-tasselled shapes, <br />
  Aerial raiment of unbodied gods; <br />
  A rapture of things that never can be born, <br />
  Hope chants to hope a bright immortal choir; <br />
  Cloud satisfies cloud, phantom to longing phantom <br />
  Leans sweetly, sweetly is clasped or sweetly chased. <br />
  This is the stuff from which the ideal is formed: <br />
  Its builder is thought, its base the heart&#8217;s desire, <br />
  But nothing real answers to their call. <br />
  The ideal dwells not in heaven, nor on the earth, <br />
  A bright delirium of man&#8217;s ardour of hope <br />
  Drunk with the wine of its own fantasy. <br />
  It is a brilliant shadow&#8217;s dreamy trail. <br />
  Thy vision&#8217;s error builds the azure skies, <br />
  Thy vision&#8217;s error drew the rainbow&#8217;s arch;</td>

<p>Thy mortal longing made for thee a soul. <br />
  This angel in thy body thou callst love, <br />
  Who shapes his wings from thy emotion&#8217;s hues, <br />
  In a ferment of thy body has been born <br />
  And with the body that housed it it must die. <br />
  It is a passion of thy yearning cells, <br />
  It is flesh that calls to flesh to serve its lust; <br />
  It is thy mind that seeks an answering mind <br />
  And dreams awhile that it has found its mate; <br />
  It is thy life that asks a human prop <br />
  To uphold its weakness lonely in the world <br />
  Or feeds its hunger on another&#8217;s life. <br />
  A beast of prey that pauses in its prowl, <br />
  It crouches under a bush in splendid flower <br />
  To seize a heart and body for its food: <br />
  This beast thou dreamst immortal and a god. <br />
  O human mind, vainly thou torturest <br />
  An hour&#8217;s delight to stretch through infinity&#8217;s <br />
  Long void and fill its formless, passionless gulfs, <br />
  Persuading the insensible Abyss <br />
  To lend eternity to perishing things, <br />
  And trickst the fragile movements of thy heart <br />
  With thy spirit&#8217;s feint of immortality. <br />
  All here emerges born from Nothingness; <br />
  Encircled it lasts by the emptiness of Space, <br />
  Awhile upheld by an unknowing Force, <br />
  Then crumbles back into its parent Nought: <br />
  Only the mute Alone can for ever be. <br />
  In the Alone there is no room for love. <br />
  In vain to clothe love&#8217;s perishable mud <br />
  Thou hast woven on the Immortals&#8217; borrowed loom <br />
  The ideal&#8217;s gorgeous and unfading robe. <br />
  The ideal never yet was real made. <br />
  Imprisoned in form that glory cannot live; <br />
  Into a body shut it breathes no more. <br />
  Intangible, remote, for ever pure,</p>

<p>A sovereign of its own brilliant void, <br />
  Unwillingly it descends to earthly air <br />
  To inhabit a white temple in man&#8217;s heart: <br />
  In his heart it shines rejected by his life. <br />
  Immutable, bodiless, beautiful, grand and dumb, <br />
  Immobile on its shining throne it sits; <br />
  Dumb it receives his offering and his prayer. <br />
  It has no voice to answer to his call, <br />
  No feet that move, no hands to take his gifts: <br />
  Aerial statue of the nude Idea, <br />
  Virgin conception of a bodiless god, <br />
  Its light stirs man the thinker to create <br />
  An earthly semblance of diviner things. <br />
  Its hued reflection falls upon man&#8217;s acts; <br />
  His institutions are its cenotaphs, <br />
  He signs his dead conventions with its name; <br />
  His virtues don the Ideal&#8217;s skiey robe <br />
  And a nimbus of the outline of its face: <br />
  He hides their littleness with the divine Name. <br />
  Yet insufficient is the bright pretence <br />
  To screen their indigent and earthy make: <br />
  Earth only is there and not some heavenly source. <br />
  If heavens there are they are veiled in their own light, <br />
  If a Truth eternal somewhere reigns unknown, <br />
  It burns in a tremendous void of God; <br />
  For truth shines far from the falsehoods of the world; <br />
  How can the heavens come down to unhappy earth <br />
  Or the eternal lodge in drifting time? <br />
  How shall the Ideal tread earth&#8217;s dolorous soil <br />
  Where life is only a labour and a hope, <br />
  A child of Matter and by Matter fed, <br />
  A fire flaming low in Nature&#8217;s grate, <br />
  A wave that breaks upon a shore in Time, <br />
  A journey&#8217;s toilsome trudge with death for goal? <br />
  The Avatars have lived and died in vain, <br />
  Vain was the sage&#8217;s thought, the prophet&#8217;s voice;</p>

  Who with a magic ritual in earth&#8217;s house <br />
  Worshippest ideal and eternal love, <br />
  What is this love thy thought has deified, <br />
  This sacred legend and immortal myth? <br />
  It is a conscious yearning of thy flesh, <br />
  It is a glorious burning of thy nerves, <br />
  A rose of dream-splendour petalling thy mind, <br />
  A great red rapture and torture of thy heart. <br />
  A sudden transfiguration of thy days, <br />
  It passes and the world is as before. <br />
  A ravishing edge of sweetness and of pain, <br />
  A thrill in its yearning makes it seem divine, <br />
  A golden bridge across the roar of the years, <br />
  A cord tying thee to eternity. <br />
  And yet how brief and frail! how soon is spent <br />
  This treasure wasted by the gods on man, <br />
  This happy closeness as of soul to soul, <br />
  This honey of the body&#8217;s companionship, <br />
  This heightened joy, this ecstasy in the veins, <br />
  This strange illumination of the sense! <br />
  If Satyavan had lived, love would have died; <br />
  But Satyavan is dead and love shall live <br />
  A little while in thy sad breast, until <br />
  His face and body fade on memory&#8217;s wall <br />
  Where other bodies, other faces come. <br />
  When love breaks suddenly into the life <br />
  At first man steps into a world of the sun; <br />
  In his passion he feels his heavenly element:</p>

<p>But only a fine sunlit patch of earth <br />
  The marvellous aspect took of heaven&#8217;s outburst; <br />
  The snake is there and the worm in the heart of the rose. <br />
  A word, a moment&#8217;s act can slay the god; <br />
  Precarious is his immortality, <br />
  He has a thousand ways to suffer and die. <br />
  Love cannot live by heavenly food alone, <br />
  Only on sap of earth can it survive. <br />
  For thy passion was a sensual want refined, <br />
  A hunger of the body and the heart; <br />
  Thy want can tire and cease or turn elsewhere. <br />
  Or love may meet a dire and pitiless end <br />
  By bitter treason, or wrath with cruel wounds <br />
  Separate, or thy unsatisfied will to others <br />
  Depart when first love&#8217;s joy lies stripped and slain: <br />
  A dull indifference replaces fire <br />
  Or an endearing habit imitates love: <br />
  An outward and uneasy union lasts <br />
  Or the routine of a life&#8217;s compromise: <br />
  Where once the seed of oneness had been cast <br />
  Into a semblance of spiritual ground <br />
  By a divine adventure of heavenly powers <br />
  Two strive, constant associates without joy, <br />
  Two egos straining in a single leash, <br />
  Two minds divided by their jarring thoughts, <br />
  Two spirits disjoined, for ever separate. <br />
  Thus is the ideal falsified in man&#8217;s world; <br />
  Trivial or sombre, disillusion comes, <br />
  Life&#8217;s harsh reality stares at the soul: <br />
  Heaven&#8217;s hour adjourned flees into bodiless Time. <br />
  Death saves thee from this and saves Satyavan: <br />
  He now is safe, delivered from himself; <br />
  He travels to silence and felicity. <br />
  Call him not back to the treacheries of earth <br />
  And the poor petty life of animal Man. <br />
  In my vast tranquil spaces let him sleep</p>

<p>In harmony with the mighty hush of death <br />
  Where love lies slumbering on the breast of peace. <br />
  And thou, go back alone to thy frail world: <br />
  Chastise thy heart with knowledge, unhood to see, <br />
  Thy nature raised into clear living heights, <br />
  The heaven-bird&#8217;s view from unimagined peaks. <br />
  For when thou givest thy spirit to a dream <br />
  Soon hard necessity will smite thee awake: <br />
  Purest delight began and it must end. <br />
  Thou too shalt know, thy heart no anchor swinging, <br />
  Thy cradled soul moored in eternal seas. <br />
  Vain are the cycles of thy brilliant mind. <br />
  Renounce, forgetting joy and hope and tears, <br />
  Thy passionate nature in the bosom profound <br />
  Of a happy Nothingness and worldless Calm, <br />
  Delivered into my mysterious rest. <br />
  One with my fathomless Nihil all forget. <br />
  Forget thy fruitless spirit&#8217;s waste of force, <br />
  Forget the weary circle of thy birth, <br />
  Forget the joy and the struggle and the pain, <br />
  The vague spiritual quest which first began <br />
  When worlds broke forth like clusters of fire-flowers, <br />
  And great burning thoughts voyaged through the sky of mind <br />
  And Time and its aeons crawled across the vasts <br />
  And souls emerged into mortality.&#8221; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But Savitri replied to the dark Power: <br />
  &#8220;A dangerous music now thou findst, O Death, <br />
  Melting thy speech into harmonious pain, <br />
  And flut&#8217;st alluringly to tired hopes <br />
  Thy falsehoods mingled with sad strains of truth. <br />
  But I forbid thy voice to slay my soul. <br />
  My love is not a hunger of the heart, <br />
  My love is not a craving of the flesh; <br />
  It came to me from God, to God returns. <br />
  Even in all that life and man have marred, <br />
  A whisper of divinity still is heard,</p>

<p>A breath is felt from the eternal spheres. <br />
  Allowed by Heaven and wonderful to man <br />
  A sweet fire-rhythm of passion chants to love. <br />
  There is a hope in its wild infinite cry; <br />
  It rings with callings from forgotten heights, <br />
  And when its strains are hushed to high-winged souls <br />
  In their empyrean, its burning breath <br />
  Survives beyond, the rapturous core of suns <br />
  That flame for ever pure in skies unseen, <br />
  A voice of the eternal Ecstasy. <br />
  One day I shall behold my great sweet world <br />
  Put off the dire disguises of the gods, <br />
  Unveil from terror and disrobe from sin. <br />
  Appeased we shall draw near our mother&#8217;s face, <br />
  We shall cast our candid souls upon her lap; <br />
  Then shall we clasp the ecstasy we chase, <br />
  Then shall we shudder with the long-sought god, <br />
  Then shall we find Heaven&#8217;s unexpected strain. <br />
  Not only is there hope for godheads pure; <br />
  The violent and darkened deities <br />
  Leaped down from the one breast in rage to find <br />
  What the white gods had missed: they too are safe; <br />
  A mother&#8217;s eyes are on them and her arms <br />
  Stretched out in love desire her rebel sons. <br />
  One who came love and lover and beloved <br />
  Eternal, built himself a wondrous field <br />
  And wove the measures of a marvellous dance. <br />
  There in its circles and its magic turns <br />
  Attracted he arrives, repelled he flees. <br />
  In the wild devious promptings of his mind <br />
  He tastes the honey of tears and puts off joy <br />
  Repenting, and has laughter and has wrath, <br />
  And both are a broken music of the soul <br />
  Which seeks out reconciled its heavenly rhyme. <br />
  Ever he comes to us across the years <br />
  Bearing a new sweet face that is the old.</p>

<p>His bliss laughs to us or it calls concealed <br />
  Like a far-heard unseen entrancing flute <br />
  From moonlit branches in the throbbing woods, <br />
  Tempting our angry search and passionate pain. <br />
  Disguised the Lover seeks and draws our souls. <br />
  He named himself for me, grew Satyavan. <br />
  For we were man and woman from the first, <br />
  The twin souls born from one undying fire. <br />
  Did he not dawn on me in other stars? <br />
  How has he through the thickets of the world <br />
  Pursued me like a lion in the night <br />
  And come upon me suddenly in the ways <br />
  And seized me with his glorious golden leap! <br />
  Unsatisfied he yearned for me through time, <br />
  Sometimes with wrath and sometimes with sweet peace <br />
  Desiring me since first the world began. <br />
  He rose like a wild wave out of the floods <br />
  And dragged me helpless into seas of bliss. <br />
  Out of my curtained past his arms arrive; <br />
  They have touched me like the soft persuading wind, <br />
  They have plucked me like a glad and trembling flower, <br />
  And clasped me happily burned in ruthless flame. <br />
  I too have found him charmed in lovely forms <br />
  And run delighted to his distant voice <br />
  And pressed to him past many dreadful bars. <br />
  If there is a yet happier greater god, <br />
  Let him first wear the face of Satyavan <br />
  And let his soul be one with him I love; <br />
  So let him seek me that I may desire. <br />
  For only one heart beats within my breast <br />
  And one god sits there throned. Advance, O Death, <br />
  Beyond the phantom beauty of this world; <br />
  For of its citizens I am not one. <br />
  I cherish God the Fire, not God the Dream.&#8221; <br />
  But Death once more inflicted on her heart <br />
  The majesty of his calm and dreadful voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;A bright hallucination are thy thoughts. <br />
  A prisoner haled by a spiritual cord, <br />
  Of thy own sensuous will the ardent slave, <br />
  Thou sendest eagle-poised to meet the sun <br />
  Words winged with the red splendour of thy heart. <br />
  But knowledge dwells not in the passionate heart; <br />
  The heart&#8217;s words fall back unheard from Wisdom&#8217;s throne. <br />
  Vain is thy longing to build heaven on earth. <br />
  Artificer of Ideal and Idea, <br />
  Mind, child of Matter in the womb of Life, <br />
  To higher levels persuades his parents&#8217; steps: <br />
  Inapt, they follow ill the daring guide. <br />
  But Mind, a glorious traveller in the sky, <br />
  Walks lamely on the earth with footsteps slow; <br />
  Hardly he can mould the life&#8217;s rebellious stuff, <br />
  Hardly can he hold the galloping hooves of sense: <br />
  His thoughts look straight into the very heavens; <br />
  They draw their gold from a celestial mine, <br />
  His acts work painfully a common ore. <br />
  All thy high dreams were made by Matter&#8217;s mind <br />
  To solace its dull work in Matter&#8217;s jail, <br />
  Its only house where it alone seems true. <br />
  A solid image of reality <br />
  Carved out of being to prop the works of Time, <br />
  Matter on the firm earth sits strong and sure. <br />
  It is the first-born of created things, <br />
  It stands the last when mind and life are slain, <br />
  And if it ended all would cease to be. <br />
  All else is only its outcome or its phase: <br />
  Thy soul is a brief flower by the gardener Mind <br />
  Created in thy matter&#8217;s terrain plot; <br />
  It perishes with the plant on which it grows, <br />
  For from earth&#8217;s sap it draws its heavenly hue: <br />
  Thy thoughts are gleams that pass on Matter&#8217;s verge, <br />
  Thy life a lapsing wave on Matter&#8217;s sea. <br />
  A careful steward of Truth&#8217;s limited means,</p>

  It tethers mind to the tent-posts of sense, <br />
  To a leaden grey routine clamps Life&#8217;s caprice <br />
  And ties all creatures with the cords of Law. <br />
  A vessel of transmuting alchemies, <br />
  A glue that sticks together mind and life, <br />

  All upon Matter stands as on a rock. <br />
  Yet this security and guarantor <br />
  Pressed for credentials an impostor proves: <br />
  A cheat of substance where no substance is, <br />
  An appearance and a symbol and a nought, <br />
  Its forms have no original right to birth: <br />
  Its aspect of a fixed stability <br />

  An order of the steps of Energy&#8217;s dance <br />

  A concrete face of unsubstantial Time, <br />
  A trickle dotting the emptiness of Space: <br />
  A stable-seeming movement without change, <br />
  Yet change arrives and the last change is death. <br />
  What seemed most real once, is Nihil&#8217;s show. <br />

  All think and act by the Inconscient&#8217;s grace. <br />
  Addict of the roseate luxury of thy thoughts, <br />
  Turn not thy gaze within thyself to look <br />
  At visions in the gleaming crystal, Mind, <br />
  Close not thy lids to dream the forms of Gods. <br />
  At last to open thy eyes consent and see <br />
  The stuff of which thou and the world are made. <br />
  Inconscient in the dumb inconscient Void <br />
  Inexplicably a moving world sprang forth:</p>

<p>Awhile secure, happily insensible, <br />
  It could not rest content with its own truth. <br />
  For something on its nescient breast was born <br />
  Condemned to see and know, to feel and love, <br />
  It watched its acts, imagined a soul within; <br />
  It groped for truth and dreamed of Self and God. <br />
  When all unconscious was, then all was well. <br />
  I, Death, was king and kept my regal state, <br />
  Designing my unwilled, unerring plan, <br />
  Creating with a calm insentient heart. <br />
  In my sovereign power of unreality <br />
  Obliging nothingness to take a form, <br />
  Infallibly my blind unthinking force <br />
  Making by chance a fixity like fate&#8217;s, <br />
  By whim the formulas of Necessity, <br />
  Founded on the hollow ground of the Inane <br />
  The sure bizarrerie of Nature&#8217;s scheme. <br />
  I curved the vacant ether into Space; <br />
  A huge expanding and contracting Breath <br />
  Harboured the fires of the universe: <br />
  I struck out the supreme original spark <br />
  And spread its sparse ranked armies through the Inane, <br />
  Manufactured the stars from the occult radiances, <br />
  Marshalled the platoons of the invisible dance; <br />
  I formed earth&#8217;s beauty out of atom and gas, <br />
  And built from chemic plasm the living man. <br />
  Then Thought came in and spoiled the harmonious world: <br />
  Matter began to hope and think and feel, <br />
  Tissue and nerve bore joy and agony. <br />
  The inconscient cosmos strove to learn its task; <br />
  An ignorant personal God was born in Mind <br />
  And to understand invented reason&#8217;s law, <br />
  The impersonal Vast throbbed back to man&#8217;s desire, <br />
  A trouble rocked the great world&#8217;s blind still heart <br />
  And Nature lost her wide immortal calm. <br />
  Thus came this warped incomprehensible scene</p>

<p>Love is a honey and poison in the breast <br />
  Drunk by it as the nectar of the gods. <br />
  Earth&#8217;s human wisdom is no great-browed power, <br />
  And love no gleaming angel from the skies; <br />
  If they aspire beyond earth&#8217;s dullard air, <br />
  Arriving sunwards with frail waxen wings, <br />
  How high could reach that forced unnatural flight? <br />
  But not on earth can divine wisdom reign <br />
  And not on earth can divine love be found; <br />
  Heaven-born, only in heaven can they live; <br />
  Or else there too perhaps they are shining dreams. <br />
  Nay, is not all thou art and doest a dream? <br />
  Thy mind and life are tricks of Matter&#8217;s force. <br />
  If thy mind seems to thee a radiant sun, <br />
  If thy life runs a swift and glorious stream, <br />

  Impotent to live by their own right divine, <br />
  Convinced of their brilliant unreality, <br />

  A bright delirium of thy speech and thought, <br />
  A strange wine of beauty lifting thee to false sight. <br />
  A noble fiction of thy yearnings made, <br />
  Thy human imperfection it must share: <br />
  Its forms in Nature disappoint the heart, <br />
  And never shall it find its heavenly shape <br />
  And never can it be fulfilled in Time. <br />
