<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">Awhile on the chill dreadful edge of Night <br />
  All stood as if a world were doomed to die <br />
  And waited on the eternal silence&#8217; brink. <br />
  Heaven leaned towards them like a cloudy brow <br />
  Of menace through the dim and voiceless hush. <br />
  As thoughts stand mute on a despairing verge <br />
  Where the last depths plunge into nothingness <br />
  And the last dreams must end, they paused; in their front <br />
  Were glooms like shadowy wings, behind them, pale, <br />
  The lifeless evening was a dead man&#8217;s gaze. <br />
  Hungry beyond, the night desired her soul. <br />
  But still in its lone niche of templed strength <br />
  Motionless, her flame-bright spirit, mute, erect, <br />
  Burned like a torch-fire from a windowed room <br />
  Pointing against the darkness&#8217; sombre breast. <br />
  The Woman first affronted the Abyss <br />
  Daring to journey through the eternal Night. <br />
  Armoured with light she advanced her foot to plunge <br />
  Into the dread and hueless vacancy; <br />
  Immortal, unappalled, her spirit faced <br />
  The danger of the ruthless eyeless waste. <br />
  Against night&#8217;s inky ground they stirred, moulding <br />
  Mysterious motion on her human tread, <br />
  A swimming action and a drifting march <br />
  Like figures moving before eyelids closed: <br />
  All as in dreams went slipping, gliding on. <br />
  The rock-gate&#8217;s heavy walls were left behind; <br />
  As if through passages of receding time <br />
  Present and past into the Timeless lapsed; <br />
  Arrested upon dim adventure&#8217;s brink,</td>

<p>The future ended drowned in nothingness. <br />
  Amid collapsing shapes they wound obscure; <br />
  The fading vestibules of a tenebrous world <br />
  Received them, where they seemed to move and yet <br />
  Be still, nowhere advancing yet to pass, <br />
  A dumb procession a dim picture bounds, <br />
  Not conscious forms threading a real scene. <br />
  A mystery of terror&#8217;s boundlessness, <br />
  Gathering its hungry strength the huge pitiless void <br />
  Surrounded slowly with its soundless depths, <br />
  And monstrous, cavernous, a shapeless throat <br />
  Devoured her into its shadowy strangling mass, <br />
  The fierce spiritual agony of a dream. <br />
  A curtain of impenetrable dread, <br />
  The darkness hung around her cage of sense <br />
  As, when the trees have turned to blotted shades <br />
  And the last friendly glimmer fades away, <br />
  Around a bullock in the forest tied <br />
  By hunters closes in no empty night. <br />
  The thought that strives in the world was here unmade; <br />
  Its effort it renounced to live and know, <br />
  Convinced at last that it had never been; <br />
  It perished, all its dream of action done: <br />
  This clotted cypher was its dark result. <br />
  In the smothering stress of this stupendous Nought <br />
  Mind could not think, breath could not breathe, the soul <br />
  Could not remember or feel itself; it seemed <br />
  A hollow gulf of sterile emptiness, <br />
  A zero oblivious of the sum it closed, <br />
  An abnegation of the Maker&#8217;s joy <br />
  Saved by no wide repose, no depth of peace. <br />
  On all that claims here to be Truth and God <br />
  And conscious self and the revealing Word <br />
  And the creative rapture of the Mind <br />
  And Love and Knowledge and heart&#8217;s delight, there fell <br />
  The immense refusal of the eternal No.</p>

<p>As disappears a golden lamp in gloom <br />
  Borne into distance from the eyes&#8217; desire, <br />
  Into the shadows vanished Savitri. <br />
  There was no course, no path, no end or goal: <br />
  Visionless she moved amid insensible gulfs, <br />
  Or drove through some great black unknowing waste, <br />
  Or whirled in a dumb eddy of meeting winds <br />
  Assembled by the titan hands of Chance. <br />
  There was none with her in the dreadful Vast: <br />
  She saw no more the vague tremendous god, <br />
  Her eyes had lost their luminous Satyavan. <br />
  Yet not for this her spirit failed, but held <br />
  More deeply than the bounded senses can <br />
  Which grasp externally and find to lose, <br />
  Its object loved. So when on earth they lived <br />
  She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades <br />
  A scene in her, its clefts her being&#8217;s vistas <br />
  Opening their secrets to his search and joy, <br />
  Because to jealous sweetness in her heart <br />
  Whatever happy space his cherished feet <br />
  Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing <br />
  His body, passioning dumbly to his tread. <br />
  But now a silent gulf between them came <br />
  And to abysmal loneliness she fell, <br />
  Even from herself cast out, from love remote. <br />
  Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time <br />
  Is measured by the throbs of the soul&#8217;s pain, <br />
  In an unreal darkness empty and drear <br />
  She travelled treading on the corpse of life, <br />
  Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls. <br />
  Solitary in the anguish of the void <br />
  She lived in spite of death, she conquered still; <br />
  In vain her puissant being was oppressed: <br />
  Her heavy long monotony of pain <br />
  Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired. <br />
  At first a faint inextinguishable gleam,</p>

<p>Pale but immortal, flickered in the gloom <br />
  As if a memory came to spirits dead, <br />
  A memory that wished to live again, <br />
  Dissolved from mind in Nature&#8217;s natal sleep. <br />
  It wandered like a lost ray of the moon <br />
  Revealing to the night her soul of dread; <br />
  Serpentine in the gleam the darkness lolled, <br />
  Its black hoods jewelled with the mystic glow; <br />
  Its dull sleek folds shrank back and coiled and slid, <br />
  As though they felt all light a cruel pain <br />
  And suffered from the pale approach of hope. <br />
  Night felt assailed her heavy sombre reign; <br />
  The splendour of some bright eternity <br />
  Threatened with this faint beam of wandering Truth <br />
  Her empire of the everlasting Nought. <br />
  Implacable in her intolerant strength <br />
  And confident that she alone was true, <br />
  She strove to stifle the frail dangerous ray; <br />
  Aware of an all-negating immensity <br />
  She reared her giant head of Nothingness, <br />
  Her mouth of darkness swallowing all that is; <br />
  She saw in herself the tenebrous Absolute. <br />
  But still the light prevailed and still it grew, <br />
  And Savitri to her lost self awoke; <br />
  Her limbs refused the cold embrace of death, <br />
  Her heart-beats triumphed in the grasp of pain; <br />
  Her soul persisted claiming for its joy <br />
  The soul of the beloved now seen no more. <br />
  Before her in the stillness of the world <br />
  Once more she heard the treading of a god, <br />
  And out of the dumb darkness Satyavan, <br />
  Her husband, grew into a luminous shade. <br />
  Then a sound pealed through that dead monstrous realm: <br />
  Vast like the surge in a tired swimmer&#8217;s ears, <br />
  Clamouring, a fatal iron-hearted roar, <br />
  Death missioned to the night his lethal call.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my silent dark immensity, <br />
  This is the home of everlasting Night, <br />
  This is the secrecy of Nothingness <br />
  Entombing the vanity of life&#8217;s desires. <br />
  Hast thou beheld thy source, O transient heart, <br />
  And known from what the dream thou art was made? <br />
  In this stark sincerity of nude emptiness <br />
  Hopest thou still always to last and love?&#8221; <br />
  The Woman answered not. Her spirit refused <br />
  The voice of Night that knew and Death that thought. <br />
  In her beginningless infinity <br />
  Through her soul&#8217;s reaches unconfined she gazed; <br />
  She saw the undying fountains of her life, <br />
  She knew herself eternal without birth. <br />
  But still opposing her with endless night <br />
  Death, the dire god, inflicted on her eyes <br />
  The immortal calm of his tremendous gaze: <br />
  &#8220;Although thou hast survived the unborn void <br />
  Which never shall forgive, while Time endures, <br />
  The primal violence that fashioned thought, <br />
  Forcing the immobile vast to suffer and live, <br />
  This sorrowful victory only hast thou won <br />
  To live for a little without Satyavan. <br />
  What shall the ancient goddess give to thee <br />
  Who helps thy heart-beats? Only she prolongs <br />
  The nothing dreamed existence and delays <br />
  With the labour of living thy eternal sleep. <br />
  A fragile miracle of thinking clay, <br />
  Armed with illusions walks the child of Time. <br />
  To fill the void around he feels and dreads, <br />
  The void he came from and to which he goes, <br />
  He magnifies his self and names it God. <br />
  He calls the heavens to help his suffering hopes. <br />
  He sees above him with a longing heart <br />
  Bare spaces more unconscious than himself <br />
  That have not even his privilege of mind,</p>

<p>And empty of all but their unreal blue, <br />
  And peoples them with bright and merciful powers. <br />
  For the sea roars around him and earth quakes <br />
  Beneath his steps, and fire is at his doors, <br />
  And death prowls baying through the woods of life. <br />
  Moved by the Presences with which he yearns, <br />
  He offers in implacable shrines his soul <br />
  And clothes all with the beauty of his dreams. <br />
  The gods who watch the earth with sleepless eyes <br />
  And guide its giant stumblings through the void, <br />
  Have given to man the burden of his mind; <br />
  In his unwilling heart they have lit their fires <br />
  And sown in it incurable unrest. <br />
  His mind is a hunter upon tracks unknown; <br />
  Amusing Time with vain discovery, <br />
  He deepens with thought the mystery of his fate <br />
  And turns to song his laughter and his tears. <br />
  His mortality vexing with the immortal&#8217;s dreams, <br />
  Troubling his transience with the infinite&#8217;s breath, <br />
  They gave him hungers which no food can fill; <br />
  He is the cattle of the shepherd gods. <br />
  His body the tether with which he is tied, <br />
  They cast for fodder grief and hope and joy: <br />
  His pasture ground they have fenced with Ignorance. <br />
  Into his fragile undefended breast <br />
  They have breathed a courage that is met by death, <br />
  They have given a wisdom that is mocked by night, <br />
  They have traced a journey that foresees no goal. <br />
  Aimless man toils in an uncertain world, <br />
  Lulled by inconstant pauses of his pain, <br />
  Scourged like a beast by the infinite desire, <br />
  Bound to the chariot of the dreadful gods. <br />
  But if thou still canst hope and still wouldst love, <br />
  Return to thy body&#8217;s shell, thy tie to earth, <br />
  And with thy heart&#8217;s little remnants try to live. <br />
  Hope not to win back to thee Satyavan.</p>

<p>Yet since thy strength deserves no trivial crown, <br />
  Gifts I can give to soothe thy wounded life. <br />
  The pacts which transient beings make with fate, <br />
  And the wayside sweetness earth-bound hearts would pluck, <br />
  These if thy will accepts make freely thine. <br />
  Choose a life&#8217;s hopes for thy deceiving prize.&#8221; <br />
  As ceased the ruthless and tremendous Voice, <br />
  Unendingly there rose in Savitri, <br />
  Like moonlit ridges on a shuddering flood, <br />
  A stir of thoughts out of some silence born <br />
  Across the sea of her dumb fathomless heart. <br />
  At last she spoke; her voice was heard by Night: <br />
  &#8220;I bow not to thee, O huge mask of death, <br />
  Black lie of night to the cowed soul of man, <br />
  Unreal, inescapable end of things, <br />
  Thou grim jest played with the immortal spirit. <br />
  Conscious of immortality I walk. <br />
  A victor spirit conscious of my force, <br />
  Not as a suppliant to thy gates I came: <br />
  Unslain I have survived the clutch of Night. <br />
  My first strong grief moves not my seated mind; <br />
  My unwept tears have turned to pearls of strength: <br />
  I have transformed my ill-shaped brittle clay <br />
  Into the hardness of a statued soul. <br />
  Now in the wrestling of the splendid gods <br />
  My spirit shall be obstinate and strong <br />
  Against the vast refusal of the world. <br />
  I stoop not with the subject mob of minds <br />
  Who run to glean with eager satisfied hands <br />
  And pick from its mire mid many trampling feet <br />
  Its scornful small concessions to the weak. <br />
  Mine is the labour of the battling gods: <br />
  Imposing on the slow reluctant years <br />
  The flaming will that reigns beyond the stars, <br />
  They lay the law of Mind on Matter&#8217;s works <br />
  And win the soul&#8217;s wish from earth&#8217;s inconscient Force.</p>

<p>First I demand whatever Satyavan, <br />
  My husband, waking in the forest&#8217;s charm <br />
  Out of his long pure childhood&#8217;s lonely dreams, <br />
  Desired and had not for his beautiful life. <br />
  Give, if thou must, or, if thou canst, refuse.&#8221; <br />
  Death bowed his head in scornful cold assent, <br />
  The builder of this dreamlike earth for man <br />
  Who has mocked with vanity all gifts he gave. <br />
  Uplifting his disastrous voice he spoke: <br />
  &#8220;Indulgent to the dreams my touch shall break, <br />
  I yield to his blind father&#8217;s longing heart <br />
  Kingdom and power and friends and greatness lost <br />
  And royal trappings for his peaceful age, <br />
  The pallid pomps of man&#8217;s declining days, <br />
  The silvered decadent glories of life&#8217;s fall. <br />
  To one who wiser grew by adverse Fate, <br />
  Goods I restore the deluded soul prefers <br />
  To impersonal nothingness&#8217;s bare sublime. <br />
  The sensuous solace of the light I give <br />
  To eyes which could have found a larger realm, <br />
  A deeper vision in their fathomless night. <br />
  For that this man desired and asked in vain <br />
  While still he lived on earth and cherished hope. <br />
  Back from the grandeur of my perilous realms <br />
  Go, mortal, to thy small permitted sphere! <br />
  Hasten swift-footed, lest to slay thy life <br />
  The great laws thou hast violated, moved, <br />
  Open at last on thee their marble eyes.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri answered the disdainful Shade: <br />
  &#8220;World-spirit, I was thy equal spirit born. <br />
  My will too is a law, my strength a god. <br />
  I am immortal in my mortality. <br />
  I tremble not before the immobile gaze <br />
  Of the unchanging marble hierarchies <br />
  That look with the stone eyes of Law and Fate. <br />
  My soul can meet them with its living fire.</p>

<p>Out of thy shadow give me back again <br />
  Into earth&#8217;s flowering spaces Satyavan <br />
  In the sweet transiency of human limbs <br />
  To do with him my spirit&#8217;s burning will. <br />
  I will bear with him the ancient Mother&#8217;s load, <br />

  Insisting on the immutable Decree, <br />
  Insisting on the immitigable Law <br />
  And the insignificance of created things, <br />

  Born from the enigma of the unknowable depths <br />
  A voice of majesty and appalling scorn. <br />
  As when the storm-haired Titan-striding sea <br />
  Throws on a swimmer its tremendous laugh <br />
  Remembering all the joy its waves have drowned, <br />
  So from the darkness of the sovereign night <br />
  Against the Woman&#8217;s boundless heart arose <br />
  The almighty cry of universal Death. <br />
  &#8220;Hast thou god-wings or feet that tread my stars, <br />
  Frail creature with the courage that aspires, <br />
  Forgetting thy bounds of thought, thy mortal role? <br />
  Their orbs were coiled before thy soul was formed. <br />
  I, Death, created them out of my void; <br />
  All things I have built in them and I destroy. <br />
  I made the worlds my net, each joy a mesh. <br />
  A Hunger amorous of its suffering prey, <br />
  Life that devours, my image see in things.</p>

  Pierced by my pangs Time shall not soon appease. <br />
  Blind slave of my deaf force whom I compel <br />

  That I may scourge thee with despair and grief <br />
  And thou come bleeding to me at the last, <br />

  Meant for the souls that can obey my law, <br />

  Who made for vanity the brilliant stars? <br />
  Not he who has reared his temple in my thoughts <br />
  And made his sacred floor my human heart. <br />
  My God is will and triumphs in his paths, <br />
  My God is love and sweetly suffers all. <br />
  To him I have offered hope for sacrifice <br />
  And gave my longings as a sacrament. <br />
  Who shall prohibit or hedge in his course,</p>

  A traveller of the million roads of life, <br />
  His steps familiar with the lights of heaven <br />
  Tread without pain the sword-paved courts of hell; <br />
  There he descends to edge eternal joy. <br />
  Love&#8217;s golden wings have power to fan thy void: <br />

  The brilliant idol of a fugitive hour. <br />
  And thou, what art thou, soul, thou glorious dream <br />
  Of brief emotions made and glittering thoughts, <br />
  A thin dance of fireflies speeding through the night, <br />
  A sparkling ferment in life&#8217;s sunlit mire? <br />

  All from my depths are born, they live by death; <br />
  All to my depths return and are no more. <br />

  My Force is Nature that creates and slays <br />
  The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live. <br />

  Man has no other help but only Death; <br />

  Because, O aspirant to divinity, <br />
  Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul, <br />
  I have assumed a face, a form, a voice. <br />
  But if there were a Being witnessing all, <br />
  How should he help thy passionate desire? <br />
  Aloof he watches sole and absolute, <br />
  Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm. <br />
  His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one. <br />
  One endless watches the inconscient scene <br />
  Where all things perish, as the foam the stars. <br />
  The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan <br />
  Changing was born and there no Savitri</p>

<p>Claims from brief life her bribe of joy. There love <br />
  Came never with his fretful eyes of tears, <br />
  Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space. <br />
  It wears no living face, it has no name, <br />

  Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build <br />

  I am, I love, I see, I act, I will.&#8221; <br />

  &#8220;Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love <br />
  And cease to will, delivered from thy heart. <br />
  So shalt thou rest for ever and be still, <br />
  Consenting to the impermanence of things.&#8221; <br />
  But Savitri replied for man to Death: <br />
  &#8220;When I have loved for ever, I shall know. <br />
  Love in me knows the truth all changings mask. <br />
  I know that knowledge is a vast embrace: <br />
  I know that every being is myself, <br />
  In every heart is hidden the myriad One. <br />
  I know the calm Transcendent bears the world, <br />
  The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord: <br />
  I feel his secret act, his intimate fire; <br />
  I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice. <br />
  I know my coming was a wave from God. <br />
  For all his suns were conscient in my birth, <br />
  And one who loves in us came veiled by death. <br />
  Then was man born among the monstrous stars</p>
