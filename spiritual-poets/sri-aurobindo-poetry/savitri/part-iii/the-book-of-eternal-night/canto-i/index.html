<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">So was she left alone in the huge wood, <br />
  Surrounded by a dim unthinking world, <br />
  Her husband&#8217;s corpse on her forsaken breast. <br />
  In her vast silent spirit motionless <br />
  She measured not her loss with helpless thoughts, <br />
  Nor rent with tears the marble seals of pain: <br />
  She rose not yet to face the dreadful god. <br />
  Over the body she loved her soul leaned out <br />
  In a great stillness without stir or voice, <br />
  As if her mind had died with Satyavan. <br />
  But still the human heart in her beat on. <br />
  Aware still of his being near to hers, <br />
  Closely she clasped to her the mute lifeless form <br />
  As though to guard the oneness they had been <br />
  And keep the spirit still within its frame. <br />
  Then suddenly there came on her the change <br />
  Which in tremendous moments of our lives <br />
  Can overtake sometimes the human soul <br />
  And hold it up towards its luminous source. <br />
  The veil is torn, the thinker is no more: <br />
  Only the spirit sees and all is known. <br />
  Then a calm Power seated above our brows <br />
  Is seen, unshaken by our thoughts and deeds, <br />
  Its stillness bears the voices of the world: <br />
  Immobile, it moves Nature, looks on life. <br />
  It shapes immutably its far-seen ends; <br />
  Untouched and tranquil amid error and tears <br />
  And measureless above our striving wills, <br />
  Its gaze controls the turbulent whirl of things. <br />
  To mate with the Glory it sees, the spirit grows: <br />
  The voice of life is tuned to infinite sounds,</td>

<p>The moments on great wings of lightning come <br />
  And godlike thoughts surprise the mind of earth. <br />
  Into the soul&#8217;s splendour and intensity <br />
  A crescent of miraculous birth is tossed, <br />
  Whose horn of mystery floats in a bright void. <br />
  As into a heaven of strength and silence thought <br />
  Is ravished, all this living mortal clay <br />
  Is seized and in a swift and fiery flood <br />
  Of touches shaped by a Harmonist unseen. <br />
  A new sight comes, new voices in us form <br />
  A body of the music of the Gods. <br />
  Immortal yearnings without name leap down, <br />
  Large quiverings of godhead seeking run <br />
  And weave upon a puissant field of calm <br />
  A high and lonely ecstasy of will. <br />
  This in a moment&#8217;s depths was born in her. <br />
  Now to the limitless gaze disclosed that sees <br />
  Things barred from human thinking&#8217;s earthly lids, <br />
  The Spirit who had hidden in Nature soared <br />
  Out of his luminous nest within the worlds: <br />
  Like a vast fire it climbed the skies of night. <br />
  Thus were the cords of self-oblivion torn: <br />
  Like one who looks up to far heights she saw, <br />
  Ancient and strong as on a windless summit <br />
  Above her where she had worked in her lone mind <br />
  Labouring apart in a sole tower of self, <br />
  The source of all which she had seemed or wrought, <br />
  A power projected into cosmic space, <br />
  A slow embodiment of the aeonic will, <br />
  A starry fragment of the eternal Truth, <br />
  The passionate instrument of an unmoved Power. <br />
  A Presence was there that filled the listening world; <br />
  A central All assumed her boundless life. <br />
  A sovereignty, a silence and a swiftness, <br />
  One brooded over abysses who was she. <br />
  As in a choric robe of unheard sounds</p>

<td valign="top" style="width: 470px;">A Force descended trailing endless lights; <br />
  Linking Time&#8217;s seconds to infinity, <br />
  Illimitably it girt the earth and her: <br />
  It sank into her soul and she was changed. <br />
  Then like a thought fulfilled by some great word <br />
  That mightiness assumed a symbol form: <br />
  Her being&#8217;s spaces quivered with its touch, <br />
  It covered her as with immortal wings; <br />
  On its lips the curve of the unuttered Truth, <br />
  A halo of Wisdom&#8217;s lightnings for its crown, <br />
  It entered the mystic lotus in her head, <br />
  A thousand-petalled home of power and light. <br />
  Immortal leader of her mortality, <br />
  Doer of her works and fountain of her words, <br />
  Invulnerable by Time, omnipotent, <br />
  It stood above her calm, immobile, mute. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All in her mated with that mighty hour, <br />
  As if the last remnant had been slain by Death <br />
  Of the humanity that once was hers. <br />
  Assuming a spiritual wide control, <br />
  Making life&#8217;s sea a mirror of heaven&#8217;s sky, <br />
  The young divinity in her earthly limbs <br />
  Filled with celestial strength her mortal part. <br />
  Over was the haunted pain, the rending fear: <br />
  Her grief had passed away, her mind was still, <br />
  Her heart beat quietly with a sovereign force. <br />
  There came a freedom from the heart-strings&#8217; clutch, <br />
  Now all her acts sprang from a godhead&#8217;s calm. <br />
  Calmly she laid upon the forest soil <br />
  The dead who still reposed upon her breast <br />
  And bore to turn away from the dead form: <br />
  Sole now she rose to meet the dreadful god. <br />
  That mightier spirit turned its mastering gaze <br />
  On life and things, inheritor of a work <br />
  Left to it unfinished from her halting past,</p>

<p>When yet the mind, a passionate learner, toiled <br />
  And ill-shaped instruments were crudely moved. <br />
  Transcended now was the poor human rule; <br />
  A sovereign power was there, a godlike will. <br />
  A moment yet she lingered motionless <br />
  And looked down on the dead man at her feet; <br />
  Then like a tree recovering from a wind <br />
  She raised her noble head; fronting her gaze <br />
  Something stood there, unearthly, sombre, grand, <br />
  A limitless denial of all being <br />
  That wore the terror and wonder of a shape. <br />
  In its appalling eyes the tenebrous Form <br />
  Bore the deep pity of destroying gods; <br />
  A sorrowful irony curved the dreadful lips <br />
  That speak the word of doom. Eternal Night <br />
  In the dire beauty of an immortal face <br />
  Pitying arose, receiving all that lives <br />
  For ever into its fathomless heart, refuge <br />
  Of creatures from their anguish and world-pain. <br />
  His shape was nothingness made real, his limbs <br />
  Were monuments of transience and beneath <br />
  Brows of unwearying calm large godlike lids <br />
  Silent beheld the writhing serpent, life. <br />
  Unmoved their timeless wide unchanging gaze <br />
  Had seen the unprofitable cycles pass, <br />
  Survived the passing of unnumbered stars <br />
  And sheltered still the same immutable orbs. <br />
  The two opposed each other with their eyes, <br />
  Woman and universal god: around her, <br />
  Piling their void unbearable loneliness <br />
  Upon her mighty uncompanioned soul, <br />
  Many inhuman solitudes came close. <br />
  Vacant eternities forbidding hope <br />
  Laid upon her their huge and lifeless look, <br />
  And to her ears, silencing earthly sounds, <br />
  A sad and formidable voice arose</p>

<p>Which seemed the whole adverse world&#8217;s. &#8220;Unclasp&#8221;, it cried, <br />
  &#8220;Thy passionate influence and relax, O slave <br />
  Of Nature, changing tool of changeless Law, <br />
  Who vainly writh&#8217;st rebellion to my yoke, <br />
  Thy elemental grasp; weep and forget. <br />
  Entomb thy passion in its living grave. <br />
  Leave now the once-loved spirit&#8217;s abandoned robe: <br />
  Pass lonely back to thy vain life on earth.&#8221; <br />
  It ceased, she moved not, and it spoke again, <br />
  Lowering its mighty key to human chords,&#8211; <br />
  Yet a dread cry behind the uttered sounds, <br />
  Echoing all sadness and immortal scorn, <br />
  Moaned like a hunger of far wandering waves. <br />
  &#8220;Wilt thou for ever keep thy passionate hold, <br />
  Thyself a creature doomed like him to pass, <br />
  Denying his soul death&#8217;s calm and silent rest? <br />
  Relax thy grasp; this body is earth&#8217;s and thine, <br />
  His spirit now belongs to a greater power. <br />
  Woman, thy husband suffers.&#8221; Savitri <br />
  Drew back her heart&#8217;s force that clasped his body still <br />
  Where from her lap renounced on the smooth grass <br />
  Softly it lay, as often before in sleep <br />
  When from their couch she rose in the white dawn <br />
  Called by her daily tasks: now too, as if called, <br />
  She rose and stood gathered in lonely strength, <br />
  Like one who drops his mantle for a race <br />
  And waits the signal, motionlessly swift. <br />
  She knew not to what course: her spirit above <br />
  On the crypt-summit of her secret form <br />
  Like one left sentinel on a mountain crest, <br />
  A fiery-footed splendour puissant-winged, <br />
  Watched flaming-silent, with her voiceless soul <br />
  Like a still sail upon a windless sea. <br />
  White passionless it rode, an anchored might, <br />
  Waiting what far-ridged impulse should arise <br />
  Out of the eternal depths and cast its surge.</p>

<p>Then Death the king leaned boundless down, as leans <br />
  Night over tired lands, when evening pales <br />
  And fading gleams break down the horizon&#8217;s walls, <br />
  Nor yet the dusk grows mystic with the moon. <br />
  The dim and awful godhead rose erect <br />
  From his brief stooping to his touch on earth, <br />
  And, like a dream that wakes out of a dream, <br />
  Forsaking the poor mould of that dead clay, <br />
  Another luminous Satyavan arose, <br />
  Starting upright from the recumbent earth <br />
  As if someone over viewless borders stepped <br />
  Emerging on the edge of unseen worlds. <br />
  In the earth&#8217;s day the silent marvel stood <br />
  Between the mortal woman and the god. <br />
  Such seemed he as if one departed came <br />
  Wearing the light of a celestial shape <br />
  Splendidly alien to the mortal air. <br />
  The mind sought things long loved and fell back foiled <br />
  From unfamiliar hues, beheld yet longed, <br />
  By the sweet radiant form unsatisfied, <br />
  Incredulous of its too bright hints of heaven; <br />
  Too strange the brilliant phantasm to life&#8217;s clasp <br />
  Desiring the warm creations of the earth <br />
  Reared in the ardour of material suns, <br />
  The senses seized in vain a glorious shade: <br />
  Only the spirit knew the spirit still, <br />
  And the heart divined the old loved heart, though changed. <br />
  Between two realms he stood, not wavering, <br />
  But fixed in quiet strong expectancy, <br />
  Like one who, sightless, listens for a command. <br />
  So were they immobile on that earthly field, <br />
  Powers not of earth, though one in human clay. <br />
  On either side of one two spirits strove; <br />
  Silence battled with silence, vast with vast. <br />
  But now the impulse of the Path was felt <br />
  Moving from the Silence that supports the stars</p>

  Luminous he moved away; behind him Death <br />
  Went slowly with his noiseless tread, as seen <br />
  In dream-built fields a shadowy herdsman glides <br />
  Behind some wanderer from his voiceless herds, <br />
  And Savitri moved behind eternal Death, <br />
  Her mortal pace was equalled with the god&#8217;s. <br />
  Wordless she travelled in her lover&#8217;s steps, <br />
  Planting her human feet where his had trod, <br />
  Into the perilous silences beyond. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At first in a blind stress of woods she moved <br />
  With strange inhuman paces on the soil, <br />
  Journeying as if upon an unseen road. <br />
  Around her on the green and imaged earth <br />
  The flickering screen of forests ringed her steps; <br />
  Its thick luxurious obstacle of boughs <br />
  Besieged her body pressing dimly through <br />
  In a rich realm of whispers palpable, <br />
  And all the murmurous beauty of the leaves <br />
  Rippled around her like an emerald robe. <br />
  But more and more this grew an alien sound, <br />
  And her old intimate body seemed to her <br />
  A burden which her being remotely bore. <br />
  Herself lived far in some uplifted scene <br />
  Where to the trance-claimed vision of pursuit, <br />
  Sole presences in a high spaceless dream, <br />
  The luminous spirit glided stilly on <br />
  And the great shadow travelled vague behind. <br />
  Still with an amorous crowd of seeking hands <br />
  Softly entreated by their old desires <br />
  Her senses felt earth&#8217;s close and gentle air <br />
  Cling round them and in troubled branches knew <br />
  Uncertain treadings of a faint-foot wind: <br />
  She bore dim fragrances, far callings touched; <br />
  The wild bird&#8217;s voice and its winged rustle came</p>

<p>As if a sigh from some forgotten world. <br />
  Earth stood aloof, yet near: round her it wove <br />
  Its sweetness and its greenness and delight, <br />
  Its brilliance suave of well-loved vivid hues, <br />
  Sunlight arriving to its golden noon, <br />
  And the blue heavens and the caressing soil. <br />
  The ancient mother offered to her child <br />
  Her simple world of kind familiar things. <br />
  But now, as if the body&#8217;s sensuous hold <br />
  Curbing the godhead of her infinite walk <br />
  Had freed those spirits to their grander road <br />
  Across some boundary&#8217;s intangible bar, <br />
  The silent god grew mighty and remote <br />
  In other spaces, and the soul she loved <br />
  Lost its consenting nearness to her life. <br />
  Into a deep and unfamiliar air <br />
  Enormous, windless, without stir or sound <br />
  They seemed to enlarge away, drawn by some wide <br />
  Pale distance, from the warm control of earth <br />
  And her grown far: now, now they would escape. <br />
  Then flaming from her body&#8217;s nest alarmed <br />
  Her violent spirit soared at Satyavan. <br />
  Out mid the plunge of heaven-surrounded rocks <br />
  So in a terror and a wrath divine <br />
  From her eyrie streams against the ascending death, <br />
  Indignant at its crouching point of steel, <br />
  A fierce she-eagle threatened in her brood, <br />
  Borne on a rush of puissance and a cry, <br />
  Outwinging like a mass of golden fire. <br />
  So on a spirit&#8217;s flaming outrush borne <br />
  She crossed the borders of dividing sense; <br />
  Like pale discarded sheaths dropped dully down <br />
  Her mortal members fell back from her soul. <br />
  A moment of a secret body&#8217;s sleep, <br />
  Her trance knew not of sun or earth or world; <br />
  Thought, time and death were absent from her grasp:</p>

<p>She knew not self, forgotten was Savitri. <br />
  All was the violent ocean of a will <br />
  Where lived captive to an immense caress, <br />
  Possessed in a supreme identity, <br />
  Her aim, joy, origin, Satyavan alone. <br />
  Her sovereign prisoned in her being&#8217;s core, <br />
  He beat there like a rhythmic heart,&#8211;herself <br />
  But different still, one loved, enveloped, clasped, <br />
  A treasure saved from the collapse of space. <br />
  Around him nameless, infinite she surged, <br />
  Her spirit fulfilled in his spirit, rich with all Time, <br />
  As if Love&#8217;s deathless moment had been found, <br />
  A pearl within eternity&#8217;s white shell. <br />
  Then out of the engulfing sea of trance <br />
  Her mind rose drenched to light streaming with hues <br />
  Of vision and, awake once more to Time, <br />
  Returned to shape the lineaments of things <br />
  And live in borders of the seen and known. <br />
  Onward the three still moved in her soul-scene. <br />
  As if pacing through fragments of a dream, <br />
  She seemed to travel on, a visioned shape <br />
  Imagining other musers like herself, <br />
  By them imagined in their lonely sleep. <br />
  Ungrasped, unreal, yet familiar, old, <br />
  Like clefts of unsubstantial memory, <br />
  Scenes often traversed, never lived in, fled <br />
  Past her unheeding to forgotten goals. <br />
  In voiceless regions they were travellers <br />
  Alone in a new world where souls were not, <br />
  But only living moods: a strange hushed weird <br />
  Country was round them, strange far skies above, <br />
  A doubting space where dreaming objects lived <br />
  Within themselves their one unchanged idea. <br />
  Weird were the grasses, weird the treeless plains; <br />
  Weird ran the road which like fear hastening <br />
  Towards that of which it has most terror, passed</p>

  Think not thy mind-born passion strength from heaven <br />
  To uplift thy spirit from its earthly base <br />
  And, breaking out from the material cage, <br />
  To upbuoy thy feet of dream in groundless Nought <br />
  And bear thee through the pathless infinite. <br />
  Only in human limits man lives safe. <br />
  Trust not in the unreal Lords of Time, <br />
  Immortal deeming this image of thyself <br />
  Which they have built on a Dream&#8217;s floating ground. <br />
  Let not the dreadful goddess move thy soul <br />
  To enlarge thy vehement trespass into worlds <br />
  Where it shall perish like a helpless thought. <br />
  Know the cold term-stones of thy hopes in life. <br />
  Armed vainly with the Ideal&#8217;s borrowed might, <br />
  Dare not to outstep man&#8217;s bound and measured force:</p>
