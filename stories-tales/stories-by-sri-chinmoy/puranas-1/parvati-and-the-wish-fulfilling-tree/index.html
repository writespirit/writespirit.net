				<p>Lord Shiva and his consort, Parvati, used to live on Mount Kailash. They <br />
meditated there and also they used to bless their devotees. They led a very <br />
happy and fruitful life.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
One day Parvati made a special request to her consort, Shiva, to take her <br />
to a grove named Nandankanan.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Definitely I will take you there,? promised Shiva. So they went together <br />
to that particular grove. All the trees in that grove were so beautiful. <br />
Parvati was extremely moved by their beauty. She asked her Lord, ?Please <br />
tell me if there is any tree that is more special than the rest. When I look <br />
at them, they all seem equally beautiful. But please tell me if there is <br />
one particular tree that is most special, or in some way different from the <br />
others.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
While she was saying these words, Parvati happened to be standing at the <br />
foot of one of the trees. Shiva said to her, ?The tree that you are now leaning <br />
against has something very special to offer.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?What is that special thing?? asked Parvati.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?This particular tree is called Kalpataru,? said Shiva. ?Kalpa? means ?whatever <br />
you desire? and ?taru? means ?tree.? ?Whatever you wish for, you will immediately <br />
get from this tree.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?My Lord, are you telling me the truth, or is this a fib?? asked Parvati.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?If you do not believe me, just ask the tree for something,? answered Shiva.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Parvati meditated for a few moments and then said, ?O tree, I want to have <br />
a most beautiful girl from you.? Immediately, a most beautiful young girl <br />
emerged from the tree. Parvati was so pleased and happy. She named the girl <br />
Ashokasundari.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Ashokasundari said to the goddess Parvati, ?You have brought me into this <br />
world. Please tell me what I should do.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Parvati looked at her lovingly and said, ?You do not have to do anything <br />
for the time being. In a few years, however, I would like you to marry a <br />
particular prince named Nahusha. He has not yet been born. He is still in <br />
Heaven. But he will take incarnation and, in the course of time, I would <br />
like you to marry him. I will make arrangements for you.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Ashokasundari was very happy to hear this news. Lord Shiva and Parvati left <br />
her there in that beautiful grove, Nandankanan, and they returned to Mount <br />
Kailash.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Now, near Nandankanan there lived a demon named Hunda. He used to claim that <br />
Nandankanan was the capital of his land. One day after entering the main <br />
grove at Nandankanan, Hunda caught sight of this most beautiful girl and <br />
immediately fell in love with her.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
The demon approached Ashokasundari and said, ?You have to marry me, you have <br />
to marry me!?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?No, I will not marry you!? said Ashokasundari. ?My future husband is Nahusha. <br />
I will marry him and nobody else. Go away from this place!?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Unfortunately, demons have a special magic power. They can take any form. <br />
After being insulted by Ashokasundari, the demon left the grove. A few days <br />
later, he took the form of a most beautiful woman and once more entered the <br />
grove where Ashokasundari lived. The beautiful woman behaved as though she <br />
was very sad and depressed.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Why are you so sad?? asked Ashokasundari. ?You seem to be quite beautiful. <br />
What is bothering you?? ?Yes, I am beautiful,? said the strange woman, ?but <br />
I am so unhappy.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?What is the reason for your unhappiness?? enquired Ashokasundari kindly.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
In a pitiful voice, the woman said, ?I am a widow. My husband was such a <br />
good man, but he was killed by the demon Hunda. Now I am so lonely. Would <br />
you like to come to my cottage and stay for a few days? It is a very simple <br />
cottage, but I keep it very clean.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Yes, I shall come with you,? said Ashokasundari.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Please be my guest for two or three days,? said the woman. ?It will make <br />
me so happy.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Ashokasundari followed this woman and they left the grove. When they came <br />
to the widow?s cottage, the widow immediately changed herself back into a <br />
demon and grabbed Ashokasundari. Ashokasundari was so furious that she cursed <br />
the demon: ?Definitely my husband, Nahusha, will kill you!? Then she managed <br />
to break free from the demon?s hold and ran away.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Now the demon was cursed. He knew that he was to be killed, and he knew that <br />
Nahusha would be the one to slay him. He started searching high and low for <br />
Nahusha so that he could kill Nahusha and nullify the curse. Naturally his <br />
search proved fruitless, because at that time Nahusha had not yet been born.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
In a neighbouring kingdom there lived a very good and pious king. He and <br />
his wife prayed to God for many, many years and, finally, his wife was blessed <br />
with a child. They decided to name him Nahusha.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
When the demon Hunda came to learn that Nahusha had taken birth, he entered <br />
the king?s palace and kidnapped the child. Nahusha was only one year old. <br />
The demon brought him home and asked his cook to kill the boy and cook him. <br />
The demon commanded his cook to serve him a most delicious meal made from <br />
the meat of the child. The demon thought that if he ate Nahusha, then there <br />
would be no possibility that Nahusha would kill him when he grew up.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Definitely I will kill him,? said the cook. ?You are my master.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Now, the cook liked the little boy so much that he did not have the heart <br />
to kill him. Instead he took the child to Vashishtha?s ashram and left him <br />
there. On the way back, he killed a deer. This deer he cooked and served <br />
to his master in place of Nahusha.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
The demon, Hunda, was so happy. ?Ah,? he said, ?now I know for certain that <br />
Nahusha is dead! I have eaten him.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Nahusha grew up in the ashram of the saint Vashishtha. Vashishtha gave him <br />
spiritual lessons. He also taught Nahusha archery and other skills. From <br />
his inner vision, he knew that Nahusha was a prince and that it was Parvati?s <br />
wish for him to marry Ashokasundari.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
A few years passed by and Nahusha did marry Ashokasundari. The two were very <br />
happy together. Because Hunda believed that Nahusha was dead, Nahusha was <br />
easily able to kill the demon and fulfil his wife?s curse.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
The story does not end with the death of Hunda. Unfortunately, he had a son <br />
by the name of Bihunda. When Hunda was killed, his son felt miserable. He <br />
decided to kill Nahusha to avenge his father?s death. So he started practising <br />
very strict tapasya, or spiritual disciplines. He was praying and praying <br />
to the cosmic gods to grant him the power to kill Nahusha once and for all.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
When the cosmic gods saw what kind of tapasya Bihunda was doing, they became <br />
afraid that his desire would be fulfilled and that he would kill Nahusha. <br />
They appealed to Lord Vishnu to help them.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Lord Vishnu took the form of a most beautiful woman and appeared before Bihunda. <br />
Bihunda fell in love with her at first sight and asked her to become his <br />
wife. The beautiful woman responded, ?I shall marry you on one condition. <br />
I wish you to bring me a particular flower. The name of this flower is ?kamoda.? <br />
You must gather ten million of these flowers and worship Lord Shiva with <br />
them. After worshipping Lord Shiva, if you can make a garland of these flowers <br />
and place it at my feet, then I shall marry you and you will have the capacity <br />
to kill Nahusha. I am making this request to you as your future wife.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Bihunda ran to look for the special tree which bore the flower kamoda. He <br />
went here and there asking people, ?Do you know what the kamoda flower looks <br />
like? Do you know where I can find the tree??&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
But nobody knew where to find the tree or what the flower looked like. In <br />
desperation, Bihunda went to Shukracharya, the Guru of the demons. Brihaspati <br />
is the Guru of the cosmic gods and Shukracharya is his counterpart for the <br />
demons. Bihunda told Shukracharya what had happened and asked him where he <br />
could find the kamoda flower.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Shukracharya explained, ?This woman has not made it clear to you at all. <br />
The kamoda flower does not grow on a tree. This particular flower comes out <br />
of the mouth of a woman. She is so enchanting! When she laughs, these flowers <br />
come out of her mouth. The colour of the flowers is yellow and they are full <br />
of fragrance. If you worship Lord Shiva with these fragrant yellow flowers, <br />
he will definitely grant you the boon of being able to kill Nahusha. But, <br />
if the woman is crying instead of laughing, you will see that the flowers <br />
which she brings out of her mouth are red in colour and without any fragrance. <br />
Be careful! Those flowers you must not touch, or there will be some serious <br />
calamity or misfortune in your life. You must gather only the yellow flowers <br />
that drop from her mouth when she laughs.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
?Where can I find her?? asked Bihunda eagerly.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Shukracharya said, ?She lives on the banks of the river Ganga. In the evening <br />
you will see her walking along by the side of the river.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
The cosmic gods were watching from Heaven. They saw what was happening and <br />
once again they became very worried. They asked Narada, the celestial musician, <br />
to come to their rescue. Narada always took the side of the gods. They informed <br />
Narada, ?If Bihunda obtains these ten million flowers, then he will definitely <br />
be able to kill King Nahusha. You must help us!?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Narada agreed to help them. He went to Bihunda and said to the demon, ?You <br />
are so great! How is it that you have to go personally to this woman to get <br />
the flowers; I will ask her to send the flowers to you. You do not have to <br />
go and get them yourself. I will ask her to put the flowers in the Ganga <br />
and the water will bring them right to your palace. It is beneath your dignity <br />
to go and beg for them. This much I can do for you. Since it is I who am <br />
asking, she will definitely do it.? Bihunda?s pride came forward and he said <br />
to Narada, ?You are right. Why should I have to go myself? I will wait for <br />
the water to bring the flowers to me.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Narada went to the banks of the river Ganga and found the woman who was the <br />
source of the kamoda flowers. After she had greeted him with great respect, <br />
he said to her, ?Now I would like you to cry and bring out of your mouth <br />
the flowers that are red in colour and without fragrance. I wish you to place <br />
them in the river and let the water carry them away.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
She gladly obeyed Narada and began to cry. From her mouth there came thousands <br />
and thousands of red flowers, and she placed them all in the water. The river <br />
flowed past Bihunda?s palace, where he had been waiting and waiting for the <br />
flowers to appear. When he saw them coming, he became so excited that he <br />
did not observe their colour and he did not notice that they had no fragrance. <br />
Seeing thousands and thousands of flowers floating down the river, he was <br />
filled with joy. ?Narada was right!? he shouted. ?The flowers have come to <br />
me, just as he said.?&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Bihunda was so thrilled and excited that he forgot his Guru?s warning. He <br />
did not pay any attention to the colour and he did not try to see if the <br />
flowers had any fragrance. In his imagination, the flowers were all yellow <br />
and fragrant. His joy had transported him to another world.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
He gathered all the flowers and started worshipping Lord Shiva. Now, Parvati <br />
saw that on earth somebody was worshipping Lord Shiva with flowers that had <br />
no fragrance. And the flowers themselves were not charming at all. She said, <br />
?This is not the flower that Lord Shiva likes. Who can be so disrespectful <br />
to my husband??&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
Parvati descended to earth and, with her third eye, she killed the demon <br />
Bihunda. She did not need any weapon at that time.&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt; <br />
We began our story with Parvati. It was she who asked the Kalpataru tree <br />
to give her a young girl. Then this girl?s curse brought about the deaths <br />
of the demon Hunda and his son Bihunda, who were mercilessly torturing innocent <br />
human beings.&lt;br&gt; <br />
