<p>This story is about one particular husband and wife. Although it is from <br />our ancient Puranas, in many ways the story sounds absolutely like twentieth-century <br />American life!&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The husband was from the Vaishya, or merchant, class. He was a very rich <br />trader and he used to travel from village to village. One day, he was returning <br />home all alone when he saw a most beautiful woman by the side of the road. <br />He fell in love with her instantly and began meeting with her frequently. <br />People came to know that he was mixing with this woman and they started speaking <br />ill of him. It was too much for his poor wife.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />She pleaded with him, What are you doing? People are saying such evil things <br />about you. Please do not bring shame upon our family! We have been happily <br />married for so many years. We have such beautiful children. Please do not <br />give it all up for this woman.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Unfortunately, the husband refused to listen to his wife. He continued seeing <br />the woman and even visited her house. For years and years the wife tolerated <br />her husbands misbehaviour. Finally, she threatened him, If you will not <br />give up your bad life, then I will do the same thing. I will find a boyfriend! <br />The husband did not take his wife seriously. He felt it was acceptable for <br />him to lead an undivine life, but he could not believe that his wife would <br />do the same. He simply disregarded her threat.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The wife was furious. She was ready to kill her husband. Finally she decided <br />that she would carry out her threat and lead an undivine life. She thought <br />that this would make her husband realise how badly he had treated her and <br />he would give up his girlfriend.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The wife found a boyfriend and began inviting him home. She wanted to teach <br />her husband a lesson. Both husband and wife were now enjoying an undivine <br />life. One day the husband came home only to discover his wifes boyfriend <br />in the house. The husband was infuriated! He struck the boyfriend and wounded <br />him so severely that the boyfriend had to be taken to the doctor. The husband <br />thought that was the end of the matter. After such a thrashing, he was sure <br />the boyfriend would not dare to return.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Unfortunately, the wife started going to the boyfriends place. During the <br />day the husband would be with his girlfriend, and at night he would come <br />home only to find that his wife was somewhere else. What a story!&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />This went on for several years, and then the wifes boyfriend lost interest <br />in her. He found somebody to take her place. The wife was very sad and disturbed. <br />O God, she cried bitterly, for him I gave up my husband and this is what <br />he has done to me! He has found somebody else! Then she said to herself, <br />Ah, it is because I am too old. I am not as beautiful as I was before. That <br />is why he does not want to see me. I cannot regain my lost beauty and I can <br />never get back all the years that I have wasted leading such an undivine <br />life. What am I going to do with my life? I know that I will die soon. Perhaps <br />it is too late for me to become spiritual, but let me see. Let me try to <br />pray and meditate for the brief time that I have left on earth.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The wife left her home and began wandering at random from place to place, <br />praying and meditating. One day she came upon a temple dedicated to Lord <br />Shiva, with a pond in front of it. There, people were reciting verses from <br />the scriptures about Shiva.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />She saw a man standing by the pond and she asked him, What are those people <br />saying?&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />They are praising Lord Shiva, he replied. These are verses from the scriptures <br />about Lord Shivas greatness and kindness. Lord Shiva forgives each and every <br />person on earth. There is nobody whom Lord Shiva does not forgive.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Will he forgive me? she asked eagerly.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />You heard them chanting, did you not? said the man.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Yes, I heard them chanting.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />That means you are already forgiven.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />But I have not prayed to Lord Shiva.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />It does not matter, the man assured her. Even if one hears Lord Shivas <br />name, one is forgiven. You have been standing here for a long time and you <br />have heard them chanting Lord Shivas name over and over, so Lord Shiva has <br />definitely forgiven you.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />How will I know that I have been forgiven? the wife asked. I am so bad! <br />I have done so many wrong things in my life.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The man explained, You will see that you have been forgiven when you die. <br />Your soul will go to Lord Shivas region, his loka.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />I will not go to hell for the bad things I have done?&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />No, no, no! Now that you have heard Lord Shivas name, you will go directly <br />to Heaven, I promise you.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />In the course of time the wife died and her soul did go to the highest Heaven, <br />as the man had said. She was so happy in that realm.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />After some time, she began to make enquiries about her boyfriend, who had <br />also died. The denizens of Heaven said, He was such a bad fellow! His soul <br />has gone to hell and he is experiencing tremendous suffering.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Can you also tell me about my husband? she asked. Your husband and your <br />boyfriend are in the same category, came the reply. But since your husband <br />started this wrong movement, his soul is suffering even more powerfully than <br />the soul of your boyfriend. Your husband is the worst culprit, so we have <br />sent him to a particular hell which is infinitely worse than all the others.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The wife began begging the Heavenly beings, Please, please, can you not <br />do something to help my husband? After all, we were both equally wrong. It <br />is only by the Grace of Lord Shiva that I am here. I just heard his name <br />at a temple and I was forgiven. It does not seem fair that I should be enjoying <br />Heaven, while my husband should be suffering so mach. After all, we were <br />happily married for such a long time. How can I bring my husbands soul to <br />Heaven? I am ready to pray and meditate. Please tell me what I should do.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Nobody will dare to go into that lowest hell, said the Heavenly beings. <br />There is nothing we can do.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />If I pray and meditate, will it make any difference? asked the wife.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Yes, they said. You can certainly pray and meditate. Who knows, one day <br />Lord Shiva may forgive your husband as he forgave you.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />So the wife started praying and meditating most fervently. After some time, <br />a messenger from Lord Shiva came and said, Lord Shiva is very pleased with <br />your sincerity. He knows what you want and he will grant you the boon. If <br />you want to descend into the lowest hell to bring back your husband, he will <br />send someone with you. One of the celestial musicians will accompany you. <br />As you were exonerated by hearing Lord Shivas devotees chanting his sacred <br />name so devotedly and soulfully, so will your husband be freed from his sins <br />by hearing this musician sing the praises of Lord Shiva. Then you and your <br />husband will be able to stay together in Heaven.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />The wife was overjoyed. She took the celestial musician with her to that <br />worst possible hell. When they reached that unbearable place, the musician <br />sang many songs in praise of Lord Shiva. Hearing them, the husband was absolved <br />of his wrongdoings and he went with his wife to live in Heaven. Because of <br />Lord Shivas compassion and forgiveness, these two were accepted into Heaven.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />In India, people still believe that no matter what kind of life you lead, <br />as long as you hear people devotedly praying to Lord Shiva or singing songs <br />in praise of him, all your sins will be washed away.&lt;br&gt; <br />&lt;br&gt; <br />Sri Chinmoy&amp;nbsp;</p>
