</p></div>
<div class="plain">
<p>`You can&#8217;t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!&#8217; said the   Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice&#8217;s, and they walked off   together.  </p>
<p>Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself     that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met     in the kitchen.</p>
<p>`When I&#8217;M a Duchess,&#8217; she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though),     `I won&#8217;t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without&#8211;Maybe     it&#8217;s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,&#8217; she went on, very much pleased     at having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them sour&#8211;and     camomile that makes them bitter&#8211;and&#8211;and barley-sugar and such things that     make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn&#8217;t     be so stingy about it, you know&#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled     when she heard her voice close to her ear. `You&#8217;re thinking about something,     my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can&#8217;t tell you just now what the     moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.&#8217;</p>
<p>`Perhaps it hasn&#8217;t one,&#8217; Alice ventured to remark.</p>
<p>`Tut, tut, child!&#8217; said the Duchess. `Everything&#8217;s got a moral, if only you     can find it.&#8217; And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice&#8217;s side as she spoke.</p>
<p>Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess     was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest     her chin upon Alice&#8217;s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However,     she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p>
<p>`The game&#8217;s going on rather better now,&#8217; she said, by way of keeping up the     conversation a little.</p>
<p>`&#8217;Tis so,&#8217; said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is&#8211;&#8221;Oh, &#8217;tis love,     &#8217;tis love, that makes the world go round!&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`Somebody said,&#8217; Alice whispered, `that it&#8217;s done by everybody minding their     own business!&#8217;</p>
<p>`Ah, well! It means much the same thing,&#8217; said the Duchess, digging her sharp     little chin into Alice&#8217;s shoulder as she added, `and the moral of that is&#8211;&#8221;Take     care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`How fond she is of finding morals in things!&#8217; Alice thought to herself.</p>
<p>`I dare say you&#8217;re wondering why I don&#8217;t put my arm round your waist,&#8217; the     Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I&#8217;m doubtful about the temper     of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?&#8217;</p>
<p>`He might bite,&#8217; Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have     the experiment tried.</p>
<p>`Very true,&#8217; said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral     of that is&#8211;&#8221;Birds of a feather flock together.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`Only mustard isn&#8217;t a bird,&#8217; Alice remarked.</p>
<p>`Right, as usual,&#8217; said the Duchess: `what a clear way you have of putting     things!&#8217;</p>
<p>`It&#8217;s a mineral, I think,&#8217; said Alice.</p>
<p>`Of course it is,&#8217; said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything     that Alice said; `there&#8217;s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that     is&#8211;&#8221;The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`Oh, I know!&#8217; exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, `it&#8217;s     a vegetable. It doesn&#8217;t look like one, but it is.&#8217;</p>
<p>`I quite agree with you,&#8217; said the Duchess; `and the moral of that is&#8211;&#8221;Be     what you would seem to be&#8221;&#8211;or if you&#8217;d like it put more simply&#8211;&#8221;Never     imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that     what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would     have appeared to them to be otherwise.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`I think I should understand that better,&#8217; Alice said very politely, `if I     had it written down: but I can&#8217;t quite follow it as you say it.&#8217;</p>
<p>`That&#8217;s nothing to what I could say if I chose,&#8217; the Duchess replied, in a     pleased tone.</p>
<p>`Pray don&#8217;t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,&#8217; said Alice.</p>
<p>`Oh, don&#8217;t talk about trouble!&#8217; said the Duchess. `I make you a present of     everything I&#8217;ve said as yet.&#8217;</p>
<p>`A cheap sort of present!&#8217; thought Alice. `I&#8217;m glad they don&#8217;t give birthday     presents like that!&#8217; But she did not venture to say it out loud.</p>
<p>`Thinking again?&#8217; the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.</p>
<p>`I&#8217;ve a right to think,&#8217; said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel     a little worried.</p>
<p>`Just about as much right,&#8217; said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly; and the     m&#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>But here, to Alice&#8217;s great surprise, the Duchess&#8217;s voice died away, even in     the middle of her favourite word `moral,&#8217; and the arm that was linked into hers     began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them,     with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>`A fine day, your Majesty!&#8217; the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.</p>
<p>`Now, I give you fair warning,&#8217; shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as     she spoke; `either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!     Take your choice!&#8217;</p>
<p>The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p>
<p>`Let&#8217;s go on with the game,&#8217; the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much     frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.</p>
<p>The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen&#8217;s absence, and were resting     in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game,     the Queen merely remarking that a moment&#8217;s delay would cost them their lives.</p>
<p>All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the     other players, and shouting `Off with his head!&#8217; or `Off with her head!&#8217; Those     whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had     to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or     so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen,     and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.</p>
<p>Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, `Have you     seen the Mock Turtle yet?&#8217;</p>
<p>`No,&#8217; said Alice. `I don&#8217;t even know what a Mock Turtle is.&#8217;</p>
<p>`It&#8217;s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,&#8217; said the Queen.</p>
<p>`I never saw one, or heard of one,&#8217; said Alice.</p>
<p>`Come on, then,&#8217; said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his history,&#8217;</p>
<p>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the     company generally, `You are all pardoned.&#8217; `Come, that&#8217;s a good thing!&#8217; she     said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions     the Queen had ordered.</p>
<p>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don&#8217;t     know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) `Up, lazy thing!&#8217; said the Queen,     `and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I     must go back and see after some executions I have ordered&#8217;; and she walked off,     leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the     creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with     it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>
<p>The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she     was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!&#8217; said the Gryphon, half to itself,     half to Alice.</p>
<p>`What is the fun?&#8217; said Alice.</p>
<p>`Why, she,&#8217; said the Gryphon. `It&#8217;s all her fancy, that: they never executes     nobody, you know. Come on!&#8217;</p>
<p>`Everybody says &#8220;come on!&#8221; here,&#8217; thought Alice, as she went slowly     after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!&#8217;</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting     sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could     hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is     his sorrow?&#8217; she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in     the same words as before, `It&#8217;s all his fancy, that: he hasn&#8217;t got no sorrow,     you know. Come on!&#8217;</p>
<p>So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full     of tears, but said nothing.</p>
<p>`This here young lady,&#8217; said the Gryphon, `she wants for to know your history,     she do.&#8217;</p>
<p>`I&#8217;ll tell it her,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: `sit down,     both of you, and don&#8217;t speak a word till I&#8217;ve finished.&#8217;</p>
<p>So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself,     `I don&#8217;t see how he can even finish, if he doesn&#8217;t begin.&#8217; But she waited patiently.</p>
<p>`Once,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was a real Turtle.&#8217;</p>
<p>These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional     exclamation of `Hjckrrh!&#8217; from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of     the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir,     for your interesting story,&#8217; but she could not help thinking there must be more     to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p>
<p>`When we were little,&#8217; the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though     still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to school in the sea. The master     was an old Turtle&#8211;we used to call him Tortoise&#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>`Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn&#8217;t one?&#8217; Alice asked.</p>
<p>`We called him Tortoise because he taught us,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle angrily:     `really you are very dull!&#8217;</p>
<p>`You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,&#8217; added     the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt     ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive     on, old fellow! Don&#8217;t be all day about it!&#8217; and he went on in these words:</p>
<p>`Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn&#8217;t believe it&#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>`I never said I didn&#8217;t!&#8217; interrupted Alice.</p>
<p>`You did,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle.</p>
<p>`Hold your tongue!&#8217; added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The     Mock Turtle went on.</p>
<p>`We had the best of educations&#8211;in fact, we went to school every day&#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>`I&#8217;ve been to a day-school, too,&#8217; said Alice; `you needn&#8217;t be so proud as all     that.&#8217;</p>
<p>`With extras?&#8217; asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p>
<p>`Yes,&#8217; said Alice, `we learned French and music.&#8217;</p>
<p>`And washing?&#8217; said the Mock Turtle.</p>
<p>`Certainly not!&#8217; said Alice indignantly.</p>
<p>`Ah! then yours wasn&#8217;t a really good school,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle in a tone     of great relief. `Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, &#8220;French,     music, and washing&#8211;extra.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>`You couldn&#8217;t have wanted it much,&#8217; said Alice; `living at the bottom of the     sea.&#8217;</p>
<p>`I couldn&#8217;t afford to learn it.&#8217; said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. `I only     took the regular course.&#8217;</p>
<p>`What was that?&#8217; inquired Alice.</p>
<p>`Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,&#8217; the Mock Turtle replied;     `and then the different branches of Arithmetic&#8211; Ambition, Distraction, Uglification,     and Derision.&#8217;</p>
<p>`I never heard of &#8220;Uglification,&#8221;&#8216; Alice ventured to say. `What is     it?&#8217;</p>
<p>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never heard of uglifying!&#8217;     it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is, I suppose?&#8217;</p>
<p>`Yes,&#8217; said Alice doubtfully: `it means&#8211;to&#8211;make&#8211;anything&#8211;prettier.&#8217;</p>
<p>`Well, then,&#8217; the Gryphon went on, `if you don&#8217;t know what to uglify is, you     are a simpleton.&#8217;</p>
<p>Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned     to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you to learn?&#8217;</p>
<p>`Well, there was Mystery,&#8217; the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects     on his flappers, `&#8211;Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling&#8211;the     Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught     us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.&#8217;</p>
<p>`What was that like?&#8217; said Alice.</p>
<p>`Well, I can&#8217;t show it you myself,&#8217; the Mock Turtle said: `I&#8217;m too stiff. And     the Gryphon never learnt it.&#8217;</p>
<p>`Hadn&#8217;t time,&#8217; said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics master, though. He     was an old crab, he was.&#8217;</p>
<p>`I never went to him,&#8217; the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he taught Laughing     and Grief, they used to say.&#8217;</p>
<p>`So he did, so he did,&#8217; said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures     hid their faces in their paws.</p>
<p>`And how many hours a day did you do lessons?&#8217; said Alice, in a hurry to change     the subject.</p>
<p>`Ten hours the first day,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle: `nine the next, and so on.&#8217;</p>
<p>`What a curious plan!&#8217; exclaimed Alice.</p>
<p>`That&#8217;s the reason they&#8217;re called lessons,&#8217; the Gryphon remarked: `because     they lessen from day to day.&#8217;</p>
<p>This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before     she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?&#8217;</p>
<p>`Of course it was,&#8217; said the Mock Turtle.</p>
<p>`And how did you manage on the twelfth?&#8217; Alice went on eagerly.</p>
<p>`That&#8217;s enough about lessons,&#8217; the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone:     `tell her something about the games now.&#8217; </p>
