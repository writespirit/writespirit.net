				<p>BOOK I </p>
<p>TELL ME, O MUSE, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide<br />
after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,<br />
and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was<br />
acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save<br />
his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he<br />
could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer<br />
folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god<br />
prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all<br />
these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may<br />
know them.<br />
So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got<br />
safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to<br />
his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got<br />
him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,<br />
there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to<br />
Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his<br />
troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to<br />
pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing<br />
and would not let him get home.<br />
Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world&#8217;s<br />
end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.<br />
He had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was<br />
enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the<br />
house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At<br />
that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by<br />
Agamemnon&#8217;s son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:<br />
&#8220;See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all<br />
nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make<br />
love to Agamemnon&#8217;s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though<br />
he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him<br />
not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to<br />
take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury<br />
told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has<br />
paid for everything in full.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva said, &#8220;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it<br />
served Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he<br />
did; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that<br />
my heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely<br />
sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an<br />
island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a<br />
goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after<br />
the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep<br />
heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of<br />
poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment<br />
to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks<br />
of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.<br />
You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy<br />
did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should<br />
you keep on being so angry with him?&#8221;<br />
And Jove said, &#8220;My child, what are you talking about? How can I<br />
forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor<br />
more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in<br />
heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with<br />
Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the<br />
Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter<br />
to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulysses<br />
outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home.<br />
Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to<br />
return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind<br />
he can hardly stand out against us.&#8221;<br />
And Minerva said, &#8220;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,<br />
the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send<br />
Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our<br />
minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,<br />
to put heart into Ulysses&#8217; son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call<br />
the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother<br />
Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I<br />
will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear<br />
anything about the return of his dear father- for this will make<br />
people speak well of him.&#8221;<br />
So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals,<br />
imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea;<br />
she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and<br />
strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased<br />
her, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus,<br />
whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses&#8217; house,<br />
disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held<br />
a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors<br />
seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and<br />
playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were<br />
bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the<br />
mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and<br />
laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.<br />
Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting<br />
moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how<br />
he would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to<br />
his own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as<br />
he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the<br />
gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for<br />
admittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him<br />
her spear. &#8220;Welcome,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to our house, and when you have<br />
partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for.&#8221;<br />
He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were<br />
within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a<br />
strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy<br />
father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he<br />
threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,<br />
and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,<br />
that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and<br />
insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.<br />
A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer<br />
and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and<br />
she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them<br />
bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the<br />
house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set<br />
cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and<br />
poured it out for them.<br />
Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and<br />
seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids<br />
went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls<br />
with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things<br />
that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink<br />
they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments<br />
of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they<br />
compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and<br />
began to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close<br />
to hers that no man might hear.<br />
&#8220;I hope, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you will not be offended with what I<br />
am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,<br />
and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in<br />
some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were<br />
to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs<br />
rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,<br />
alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say<br />
that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him<br />
again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where<br />
you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship<br />
you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation<br />
they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. Tell<br />
me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house,<br />
or have you been here in my father&#8217;s time? In the old days we had many<br />
visitors for my father went about much himself.&#8221;<br />
And Minerva answered, &#8220;I will tell you truly and particularly all<br />
about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the<br />
Taphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men<br />
of a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I<br />
shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the<br />
open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the<br />
wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old<br />
Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say,<br />
however, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself in<br />
the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and<br />
get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about<br />
his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was<br />
why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he<br />
is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some<br />
sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are<br />
detaining him against his will I am no prophet, and know very little<br />
about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and<br />
assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of<br />
such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find<br />
some means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can<br />
Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are<br />
indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close<br />
friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the<br />
Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen the<br />
other.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My mother,&#8221; answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses,<br />
but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were<br />
son to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you<br />
ask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they<br />
tell me is my father.&#8221;<br />
And Minerva said, &#8220;There is no fear of your race dying out yet,<br />
while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell<br />
me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these<br />
people? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a<br />
wedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any<br />
provisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are<br />
behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to<br />
disgust any respectable person who comes near them.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Telemachus, &#8220;as regards your question, so long as my<br />
father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods<br />
in their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him<br />
away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have<br />
borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his<br />
men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days<br />
of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a<br />
mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his<br />
renown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not<br />
wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him,<br />
and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply<br />
with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon<br />
me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands,<br />
Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the<br />
principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the<br />
pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point<br />
blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so<br />
they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also<br />
with myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed Minerva, &#8220;then you do indeed want Ulysses<br />
home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if<br />
he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking<br />
and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally<br />
suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was<br />
then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his<br />
arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods<br />
and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he<br />
was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these<br />
suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.<br />
&#8220;But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to<br />
return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however,<br />
urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take<br />
my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your<br />
case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors<br />
take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother&#8217;s<br />
mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will<br />
find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so<br />
dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you<br />
to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go<br />
in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may<br />
tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some<br />
heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask<br />
Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home<br />
last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on<br />
his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make<br />
for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his<br />
death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due<br />
pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry<br />
again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind<br />
how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own<br />
house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard<br />
how people are singing Orestes&#8217; praises for having killed his father&#8217;s<br />
murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your<br />
mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I<br />
must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I<br />
keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and<br />
remember what I have said to you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;it has been very kind of you to talk to<br />
me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you<br />
tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a<br />
little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I<br />
will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way<br />
rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake<br />
such as only dear friends give to one another.&#8221;<br />
Minerva answered, &#8220;Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way<br />
at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it<br />
till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give<br />
me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in<br />
return.&#8221;<br />
With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had<br />
given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever<br />
about his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that<br />
the stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the<br />
suitors were sitting.<br />
Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he<br />
told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had<br />
laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his<br />
song from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not<br />
alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the<br />
suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the<br />
roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She<br />
held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.<br />
&#8220;Phemius,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you know many another feat of gods and<br />
heroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one<br />
of these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad<br />
tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost<br />
husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great<br />
over all Hellas and middle Argos.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;let the bard sing what he has a mind<br />
to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who<br />
makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his<br />
own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the<br />
ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the<br />
latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses<br />
is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another<br />
went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy<br />
yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the<br />
ordering of your servants; for speech is man&#8217;s matter, and mine<br />
above all others- for it is I who am master here.&#8221;<br />
She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son&#8217;s saying in<br />
her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,<br />
she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her<br />
eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,<br />
and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.<br />
Then Telemachus spoke, &#8220;Shameless,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and insolent suitors,<br />
let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it<br />
is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;<br />
but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal<br />
notice to depart, and feast at one another&#8217;s houses, turn and turn<br />
about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in<br />
spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with<br />
you in full, and when you fall in my father&#8217;s house there shall be<br />
no man to avenge you.&#8221;<br />
The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the<br />
boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, &#8220;The<br />
gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may<br />
Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before<br />
you.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus answered, &#8220;Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god<br />
willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you<br />
can think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings<br />
both riches and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many<br />
great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the<br />
lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and<br />
will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.&#8221;<br />
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, &#8220;It rests with heaven<br />
to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your<br />
own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man<br />
in Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good<br />
fellow, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he<br />
come from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he<br />
brought you news about the return of your father, or was he on<br />
business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so<br />
suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know<br />
him.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My father is dead and gone,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;and even if some<br />
rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed<br />
sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his<br />
prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of<br />
Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father&#8217;s.&#8221; But<br />
in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.<br />
The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the<br />
evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to<br />
bed each in his own abode. Telemachus&#8217;s room was high up in a tower<br />
that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and<br />
full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the<br />
son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.<br />
Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he<br />
gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to<br />
her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did<br />
not take her to his bed for he feared his wife&#8217;s resentment. She it<br />
was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better<br />
than any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him<br />
when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down<br />
upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old<br />
woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by<br />
his bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver<br />
catch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as<br />
he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through<br />
of his intended voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.</p>
<p>
BOOK II</p>
<p>NOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,<br />
Telemachus rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his<br />
comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room<br />
looking like an immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call<br />
the people in assembly, so they called them and the people gathered<br />
thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place of<br />
assembly spear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him.<br />
Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all<br />
marvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place&#8217; in his<br />
father&#8217;s seat even the oldest councillors made way for him.<br />
Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,<br />
the first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,<br />
land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when<br />
they were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner<br />
for him, He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their<br />
father&#8217;s land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors;<br />
nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and<br />
was still weeping for him when he began his speech.<br />
&#8220;Men of Ithaca,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hear my words. From the day Ulysses<br />
left us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who<br />
then can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to<br />
convene us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish<br />
to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?<br />
I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him<br />
his heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he<br />
was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the<br />
assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,<br />
turning to Aegyptius, &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is I, as you will shortly<br />
learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I<br />
have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn<br />
you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would<br />
speak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great<br />
misfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the<br />
loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present,<br />
and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more<br />
serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of<br />
all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them<br />
against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius,<br />
asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage<br />
gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my<br />
father&#8217;s house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their<br />
banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of<br />
wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no<br />
Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own<br />
against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was,<br />
still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I<br />
cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced<br />
and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to<br />
public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should<br />
be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is<br />
the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends,<br />
and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses<br />
did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by<br />
aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out<br />
of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating<br />
yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some<br />
purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got<br />
paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.&#8221;<br />
With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into<br />
tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no<br />
one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who<br />
spoke thus:<br />
&#8220;Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to<br />
throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother&#8217;s fault not ours,<br />
for she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on<br />
four, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each<br />
one of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what<br />
she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set<br />
up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous<br />
piece of fine needlework. &#8216;Sweet hearts,&#8217; said she, &#8216;Ulysses is indeed<br />
dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for I<br />
would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have<br />
completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against<br />
the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women<br />
of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her<br />
working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick<br />
the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for<br />
three years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she<br />
was now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was<br />
doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so<br />
she had to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors,<br />
therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may<br />
understand-&#8217;Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her<br />
own and of her father&#8217;s choice&#8217;; for I do not know what will happen if<br />
she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on<br />
the score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because<br />
she is so clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all<br />
about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they<br />
were nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her<br />
to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with<br />
which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up<br />
your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets<br />
all the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.<br />
Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither<br />
here nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some<br />
one or other of us.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus answered, &#8220;Antinous, how can I drive the mother who<br />
bore me from my father&#8217;s house? My father is abroad and we do not know<br />
whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay<br />
Icarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his<br />
daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but<br />
heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house<br />
will calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a<br />
creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you<br />
choose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at<br />
one another&#8217;s houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on<br />
the other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,<br />
heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you<br />
fall in my father&#8217;s house there shall be no man to avenge you.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and<br />
they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own<br />
lordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly<br />
they wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and<br />
glaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting<br />
fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right<br />
over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each<br />
other what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best<br />
prophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in<br />
all honesty, saying:<br />
&#8220;Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the<br />
suitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going<br />
to be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death<br />
and destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live<br />
in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this<br />
wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord;<br />
it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without due<br />
knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the<br />
Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going<br />
through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again<br />
in the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this<br />
is coming true.&#8221;<br />
Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, &#8220;Go home, old man, and prophesy<br />
to your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these<br />
omens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about<br />
in the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.<br />
Ulysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead<br />
along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to<br />
the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you<br />
think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you-<br />
and it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should know<br />
better, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the<br />
first place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he will<br />
take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in the<br />
next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will<br />
at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for<br />
Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother<br />
back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with<br />
all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall go<br />
on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither<br />
for him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of<br />
yours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate<br />
you the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus&#8217;s<br />
estate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off<br />
tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of<br />
expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such<br />
rare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we<br />
should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us.&#8221;<br />
Then Telemachus said, &#8220;Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall<br />
say no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people<br />
of Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of<br />
twenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta<br />
and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing.<br />
Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear things in<br />
this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him<br />
as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you<br />
suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other<br />
hand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral<br />
rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my<br />
mother marry again.&#8221;<br />
With these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of<br />
Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority<br />
over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty<br />
addressed them thus:<br />
&#8220;Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and<br />
well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I<br />
hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for<br />
there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as<br />
though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,<br />
for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their<br />
hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can<br />
take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am<br />
shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to<br />
stop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for<br />
you are many and they are few.&#8221;<br />
Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, &#8220;Mentor, what<br />
folly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is<br />
a hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even<br />
though Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in<br />
his house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so<br />
very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood<br />
would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. There<br />
is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you<br />
people go about your business, and let his father&#8217;s old friends,<br />
Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at<br />
all- which I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay where<br />
he is till some one comes and tells him something.&#8221;<br />
On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own<br />
abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.<br />
Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands<br />
in the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.<br />
&#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you god who visited me yesterday, and bade<br />
me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been<br />
missing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the<br />
wicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.&#8221;<br />
As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness<br />
and with the voice of Mentor. &#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if you are made<br />
of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward<br />
henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work<br />
half done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be<br />
fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in<br />
your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom<br />
as good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better;<br />
still, as you are not going to be either fool or coward<br />
henceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father&#8217;s<br />
wise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you<br />
never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they<br />
have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the<br />
doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall<br />
perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long<br />
delayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find<br />
you a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return<br />
home, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready<br />
for your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the<br />
barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I<br />
go round the town and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships<br />
in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and<br />
will choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea<br />
without delay.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time<br />
in doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the<br />
suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous<br />
came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,<br />
saying, &#8220;Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood<br />
neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do.<br />
The Achaeans will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew<br />
to boot- so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of<br />
your noble father.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Antinous,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;I cannot eat in peace, nor take<br />
pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough<br />
that you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet<br />
a boy? Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger,<br />
and whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do<br />
you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain<br />
though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own,<br />
and must be passenger not captain.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile<br />
the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering<br />
at him tauntingly as they did so.<br />
&#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said one youngster, &#8220;means to be the death of us; I<br />
suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or<br />
again from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to<br />
Ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?&#8221;<br />
Another said, &#8220;Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will<br />
be like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we<br />
should have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property<br />
amongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who<br />
marries her have that.&#8221;<br />
This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty<br />
and spacious store-room where his father&#8217;s treasure of gold and bronze<br />
lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes<br />
were kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant<br />
olive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit<br />
for a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses<br />
should come home again after all. The room was closed with well-made<br />
doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper<br />
Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of<br />
everything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room<br />
and said:<br />
&#8220;Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you<br />
are keeping for my father&#8217;s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should<br />
escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have<br />
twelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some<br />
well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in<br />
all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing about<br />
it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother<br />
has gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos<br />
to see if I can hear anything about the return of my dear father.<br />
When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to<br />
him, saying, &#8220;My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as<br />
that into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who<br />
are the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in<br />
some foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is<br />
turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of<br />
the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay<br />
where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and<br />
worrying your life out on the barren ocean.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Fear not, nurse,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;my scheme is not without<br />
heaven&#8217;s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all<br />
this to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days,<br />
unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want<br />
her to spoil her beauty by crying.&#8221;<br />
The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she<br />
had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,<br />
and getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went<br />
back to the suitors.<br />
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,<br />
and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to<br />
meet at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of<br />
Phronius, and asked him to let her have a ship- which he was very<br />
ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was over all the<br />
land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her<br />
that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the<br />
harbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke<br />
encouragingly to each of them.<br />
Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the<br />
suitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them,<br />
and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of<br />
sitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with<br />
their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and<br />
voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.<br />
&#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said she, &#8220;the men are on board and at their oars,<br />
waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.&#8221;<br />
On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps.<br />
When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water<br />
side, and Telemachus said, &#8220;Now my men, help me to get the stores on<br />
board; they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does<br />
not know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.&#8221;<br />
With these words he led the way and the others followed after.<br />
When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on<br />
board, Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of<br />
the vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the<br />
hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair<br />
wind from the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon<br />
Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and<br />
they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross<br />
plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they<br />
hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As<br />
the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep<br />
blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.<br />
Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls<br />
to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are<br />
from everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of<br />
Jove.<br />
Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the<br />
night from dark till dawn.</p>
<p>
BOOK III</p>
<p>BUT as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of<br />
heaven to shed Blight on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the<br />
city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore<br />
to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.<br />
There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were<br />
nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and<br />
burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,<br />
Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their<br />
ship to anchor, and went ashore.<br />
Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,<br />
&#8220;Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have<br />
taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried<br />
and how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may<br />
see what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and<br />
he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But how, Mentor,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;dare I go up to Nestor,<br />
and how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding<br />
long conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning<br />
one who is so much older than myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Some things, Telemachus,&#8221; answered Minerva, &#8220;will be suggested to<br />
you by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am<br />
assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth<br />
until now.&#8221;<br />
She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps<br />
till they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were<br />
assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his<br />
company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces<br />
of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they saw<br />
the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and<br />
bade them take their places. Nestor&#8217;s son Pisistratus at once<br />
offered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft<br />
sheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his<br />
brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inward<br />
meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it to<br />
Minerva first, and saluting her at the same time.<br />
&#8220;Offer a prayer, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to King Neptune, for it is his<br />
feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your<br />
drink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also.<br />
I doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live<br />
without God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is<br />
much of an age with myself, so I he handed I will give you the<br />
precedence.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and<br />
proper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began<br />
praying heartily to Neptune. &#8220;O thou,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;that encirclest the<br />
earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon<br />
thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and<br />
on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some<br />
handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly,<br />
grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter<br />
that has brought us in our to Pylos.&#8221;<br />
When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to<br />
Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats<br />
were roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave<br />
every man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon<br />
as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene,<br />
began to speak.<br />
&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that our guests have done their dinner, it will<br />
be best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,<br />
and from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail<br />
the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man&#8217;s<br />
hand against you?&#8221;<br />
Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask<br />
about his father and get himself a good name.<br />
&#8220;Nestor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you<br />
ask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under<br />
Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not<br />
public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said<br />
to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what<br />
fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as<br />
regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he<br />
is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,<br />
nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at<br />
sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your<br />
knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end,<br />
whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other<br />
traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things<br />
out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what<br />
you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either<br />
by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,<br />
bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My friend,&#8221; answered Nestor, &#8220;you recall a time of much sorrow to<br />
my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while<br />
privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city<br />
of king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles,<br />
Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a<br />
man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered<br />
much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole<br />
story? Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or<br />
even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you<br />
would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long<br />
years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was<br />
against us; during all this time there was no one who could compare<br />
with your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can<br />
hardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would<br />
say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. He<br />
and I never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in<br />
camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised<br />
the Argives how all might be ordered for the best.<br />
&#8220;When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting<br />
sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex<br />
the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either<br />
wise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the<br />
displeasure of Jove&#8217;s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel<br />
between the two sons of Atreus.<br />
&#8220;The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should<br />
be, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they<br />
explained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that<br />
Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased<br />
Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered<br />
hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he<br />
might have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods<br />
have made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two<br />
stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet<br />
with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they<br />
should do.<br />
&#8220;That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching<br />
mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into<br />
the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,<br />
about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the other<br />
half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had<br />
smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the<br />
gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not<br />
yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the<br />
course of which some among us turned their ships back again, and<br />
sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I,<br />
and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that<br />
mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and<br />
his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found<br />
us making up our minds about our course- for we did not know whether<br />
to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our<br />
left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So<br />
we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we<br />
should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open<br />
sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up<br />
which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, where<br />
we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far on<br />
our way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships in<br />
Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from the<br />
day when heaven first made it fair for me.<br />
&#8220;Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing<br />
anything about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor<br />
who were lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve<br />
the reports that have reached me since I have been here in my own<br />
house. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles&#8217; son<br />
Neoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.<br />
Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers who<br />
escaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. No<br />
matter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard of<br />
Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus- and<br />
a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thing<br />
it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did, who<br />
killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too,<br />
then- for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your mettle and<br />
make yourself a name in story.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Nestor son of Neleus,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;honour to the<br />
Achaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live<br />
through all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that<br />
heaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the<br />
wicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but<br />
the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father,<br />
so we must bear it as best we may.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My friend,&#8221; said Nestor, &#8220;now that you remind me, I remember to<br />
have heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed<br />
towards you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this<br />
tamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who<br />
knows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these<br />
scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans<br />
behind him? If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she<br />
did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet<br />
saw the gods so openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your<br />
father), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him,<br />
these wooers would soon some of them him, forget their wooing.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus answered, &#8220;I can expect nothing of the kind; it would<br />
be far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even<br />
though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall<br />
me.&#8221;<br />
On this Minerva said, &#8220;Telemachus, what are you talking about?<br />
Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were<br />
me, I should not care how much I suffered before getting home,<br />
provided I could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this,<br />
than get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon<br />
was by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is<br />
certain, and when a man&#8217;s hour is come, not even the gods can save<br />
him, no matter how fond they are of him.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mentor,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;do not let us talk about it any<br />
more. There is no chance of my father&#8217;s ever coming back; the gods<br />
have long since counselled his destruction. There is something else,<br />
however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much<br />
more than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three<br />
generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,<br />
therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die<br />
in that way? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus<br />
to kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from<br />
Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took<br />
heart and killed Agamemnon?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you truly,&#8221; answered Nestor, &#8220;and indeed you have<br />
yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back<br />
from Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would<br />
have been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead,<br />
but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures,<br />
and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of<br />
great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and<br />
Aegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,<br />
cajoled Agamemnon&#8217;s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.<br />
&#8220;At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for<br />
she was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard<br />
with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for<br />
Troy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had<br />
counselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert<br />
island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after<br />
which she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he<br />
offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many<br />
temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond<br />
his expectations.<br />
&#8220;Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good<br />
terms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of<br />
Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the<br />
steersman of Menelaus&#8217; ship (and never man knew better how to handle a<br />
vessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the<br />
helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press<br />
forward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due<br />
funeral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and<br />
had sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against<br />
him and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here<br />
he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the<br />
Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is<br />
a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place<br />
called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus<br />
the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter<br />
Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make<br />
a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the<br />
rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As<br />
for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to<br />
Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of<br />
an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil<br />
deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in<br />
Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year<br />
Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the<br />
murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his<br />
mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and<br />
on that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his<br />
ships could carry.<br />
&#8220;Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far<br />
from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in<br />
your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you<br />
will have been on a fool&#8217;s errand. Still, I should advise you by all<br />
means to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among<br />
such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from,<br />
when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning;<br />
even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and<br />
terrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by<br />
sea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travel<br />
by land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my<br />
sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him<br />
to speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an<br />
excellent person.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,<br />
&#8220;Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the<br />
tongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make<br />
drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to<br />
bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early and not keep late<br />
hours at a religious festival.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men<br />
servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled<br />
the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving<br />
every man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the<br />
victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings.<br />
When they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he<br />
was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their<br />
ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.<br />
&#8220;Heaven and the immortal gods,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;forbid that you<br />
should leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so<br />
poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be<br />
unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let<br />
me tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit<br />
the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-<br />
not while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep<br />
open house as have done.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva answered, &#8220;Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be<br />
much better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,<br />
shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to<br />
give orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only<br />
older person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus&#8217; own<br />
age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to<br />
the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the<br />
Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As<br />
for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a<br />
chariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to<br />
provide him with your best and fleetest horses.&#8221;<br />
When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and<br />
all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took<br />
Telemachus by the hand. &#8220;My friend,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I see that you are<br />
going to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus<br />
while you are still so young. This can have been none other of those<br />
who dwell in heaven than Jove&#8217;s redoubtable daughter, the<br />
Trito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave father among the<br />
Argives.&#8221; &#8220;Holy queen,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;vouchsafe to send down thy<br />
grace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will<br />
offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old,<br />
unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her<br />
horns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the<br />
way to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When<br />
they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and<br />
seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old<br />
when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he<br />
mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva,<br />
daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their<br />
drink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the<br />
others went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put<br />
Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with<br />
Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As for<br />
himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his<br />
wife by his side.<br />
Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,<br />
Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and<br />
polished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat<br />
Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone<br />
to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand,<br />
as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms<br />
gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and<br />
Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined<br />
them they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.<br />
&#8220;My sons,&#8221; said he, &#8220;make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish<br />
first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who<br />
manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday&#8217;s festivities. Go,<br />
then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me<br />
out a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to<br />
Telemachus&#8217;s ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in<br />
charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the<br />
goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you<br />
where you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent<br />
dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering.<br />
Tell them also- to bring me some clear spring water.&#8221;<br />
On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was<br />
brought in from the plain, and Telemachus&#8217;s crew came from the ship;<br />
the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he<br />
worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor<br />
gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that<br />
the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and<br />
Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the<br />
house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand<br />
he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a<br />
sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.<br />
Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley<br />
meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock<br />
from the heifer&#8217;s head upon the fire.<br />
When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal<br />
Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a<br />
stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon<br />
the daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife<br />
Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with<br />
delight. Then they lifted the heifer&#8217;s head from off the ground, and<br />
Pisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite<br />
dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course,<br />
wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw<br />
meat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire<br />
and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with<br />
five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and<br />
they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up<br />
small, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.<br />
Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor&#8217;s youngest daughter, washed<br />
Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she<br />
brought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he<br />
came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the<br />
outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to<br />
dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept<br />
pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had<br />
had enough to eat and drink Nestor said, &#8220;Sons, put Telemachus&#8217;s<br />
horses to the chariot that he may start at once.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the<br />
fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a<br />
provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of<br />
princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus<br />
gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the<br />
horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country,<br />
leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they<br />
travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and<br />
darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles<br />
lived, who was son to Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they<br />
passed the night and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the<br />
child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked their<br />
horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing<br />
gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward<br />
nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the open<br />
country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so well<br />
did their steeds take them.<br />
Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,</p>
<p>
BOOK IV</p>
<p>THEY reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they<br />
drove straight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own<br />
house, feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his<br />
son, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that<br />
valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to<br />
him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the<br />
marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to<br />
the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles&#8217; son was reigning. For<br />
his only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.<br />
This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven<br />
vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who<br />
was fair as golden Venus herself.<br />
So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making<br />
merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his<br />
lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them<br />
when the man struck up with his tune.]<br />
Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,<br />
whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw<br />
them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went<br />
close up to him and said, &#8220;Menelaus, there are some strangers come<br />
here, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we<br />
take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as<br />
they best can?&#8221;<br />
Menelaus was very angry and said, &#8220;Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you<br />
never used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their<br />
horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have<br />
supper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people&#8217;s houses<br />
before we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in<br />
peace henceforward.&#8221;<br />
So Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They<br />
took their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the<br />
mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they<br />
leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led<br />
the way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished<br />
when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;<br />
then, when they had admired everything to their heart&#8217;s content,<br />
they went into the bath room and washed themselves.<br />
When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they<br />
brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats<br />
by the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a<br />
beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to<br />
wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper<br />
servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of<br />
what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates of<br />
all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.<br />
Menelaus then greeted them saying, &#8220;Fall to, and welcome; when you<br />
have done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such<br />
men as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of<br />
sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you<br />
are.&#8221;<br />
On this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set<br />
near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the<br />
good things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to<br />
eat and drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head<br />
so close that no one might hear, &#8220;Look, Pisistratus, man after my<br />
own heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and<br />
silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of<br />
Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus overheard him and said, &#8220;No one, my sons, can hold his<br />
own with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but<br />
among mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth as<br />
I have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much<br />
and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before<br />
I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the<br />
Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the<br />
Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are<br />
born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that<br />
country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good<br />
milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was<br />
travelling and getting great riches among these people, my brother was<br />
secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked<br />
wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth.<br />
Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this,<br />
and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and<br />
magnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now<br />
have so that I had stayed at home, and all those were living who<br />
perished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit<br />
here in my house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for<br />
sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort<br />
and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for<br />
one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him without<br />
loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one<br />
of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He<br />
took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for<br />
he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or<br />
dead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son<br />
Telemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged<br />
in grief on his account.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he<br />
bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard<br />
him thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with<br />
both hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him<br />
choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find<br />
what it was all about.<br />
While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted<br />
and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought<br />
her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the<br />
silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her.<br />
Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the<br />
whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two<br />
tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave<br />
Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a<br />
silver work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top<br />
of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn,<br />
and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was laid upon the<br />
top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the<br />
footstool, and began to question her husband.<br />
&#8220;Do we know, Menelaus,&#8221; said she, &#8220;the names of these strangers<br />
who have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I<br />
cannot help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or<br />
woman so like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know<br />
what to think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left<br />
as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in<br />
your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear wife,&#8221; replied Menelaus, &#8220;I see the likeness just as you<br />
do. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses&#8217;; so is his hair, with<br />
the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I<br />
was talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my<br />
account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.&#8221;<br />
Then Pisistratus said, &#8220;Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in<br />
thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and<br />
is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one<br />
whose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My<br />
father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know<br />
whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always<br />
trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without<br />
supporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father<br />
is absent, and there is no one among his own people to stand by him.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Bless my heart,&#8221; replied Menelaus, &#8220;then I am receiving a visit<br />
from the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for<br />
my sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked<br />
distinction when heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the<br />
seas. I should have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a<br />
house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son,<br />
and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of the<br />
neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen<br />
one another continually, and nothing but death could have<br />
interrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however,<br />
that heaven grudged us such great good fortune, for it has prevented<br />
the poor fellow from ever getting home at all.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,<br />
Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his<br />
eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom<br />
the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,<br />
&#8220;Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told<br />
me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it<br />
be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I<br />
am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the<br />
forenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.<br />
This is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads<br />
for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died<br />
at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to<br />
have known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him<br />
myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight<br />
valiant.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Your discretion, my friend,&#8221; answered Menelaus, &#8220;is beyond your<br />
years. It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a<br />
man is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and<br />
offspring- and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his<br />
days, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him<br />
who are both we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore<br />
to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be<br />
poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another<br />
fully in the morning.&#8221;<br />
On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their<br />
hands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before<br />
them.<br />
Then Jove&#8217;s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She<br />
drugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and<br />
ill humour. Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear<br />
all the rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of<br />
them drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces<br />
before his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue,<br />
had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt,<br />
where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the<br />
mixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole<br />
country is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon.<br />
When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to<br />
serve the wine round, she said:<br />
&#8220;Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of<br />
honourable men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of<br />
good and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will,<br />
and listen while I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name<br />
every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did<br />
when he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of<br />
difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed<br />
himself all in rags, and entered the enemy&#8217;s city looking like a<br />
menial or a beggar. and quite different from what he did when he was<br />
among his own people. In this disguise he entered the city of Troy,<br />
and no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him and began to<br />
question him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I had<br />
washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had<br />
sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got<br />
safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that<br />
the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got much<br />
information before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things<br />
the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for<br />
my heart was beginning to oam after my home, and I was unhappy about<br />
wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from my<br />
country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no<br />
means deficient either in person or understanding.&#8221;<br />
Then Menelaus said, &#8220;All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is<br />
true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,<br />
but I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,<br />
and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the<br />
bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and<br />
destruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some<br />
god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and<br />
you had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our<br />
hiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name,<br />
and mimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats<br />
inside heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our<br />
minds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from<br />
inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all<br />
except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped<br />
his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was<br />
this that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took<br />
you away again.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;How sad,&#8221; exclaimed Telemachus, &#8220;that all this was of no avail to<br />
save him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to<br />
send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of<br />
sleep.&#8221;<br />
On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that<br />
was in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and<br />
spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests<br />
to wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,<br />
to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus,<br />
then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt,<br />
while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by<br />
his side.<br />
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus<br />
rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely<br />
feet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room<br />
looking like an immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he<br />
said:<br />
&#8220;And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to<br />
Lacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about<br />
it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I have come, sir replied Telemachus, &#8220;to see if you can tell me<br />
anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my<br />
fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who<br />
keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of<br />
paying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your<br />
knees if haply you may tell me about my father&#8217;s melancholy end,<br />
whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other<br />
traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things<br />
out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly<br />
what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service<br />
either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the<br />
Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. &#8220;So,&#8221; he<br />
exclaimed, &#8220;these cowards would usurp a brave man&#8217;s bed? A hind<br />
might as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then<br />
go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when<br />
he comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of<br />
them- and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva,<br />
and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled<br />
with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the<br />
Achaeans cheered him- if he is still such and were to come near<br />
these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.<br />
As regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive<br />
you, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the<br />
sea told me.<br />
&#8220;I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,<br />
for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods<br />
are very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far<br />
as a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there<br />
is an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels<br />
can get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the<br />
gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair<br />
wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions<br />
and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me<br />
and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old<br />
man of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.<br />
&#8220;She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for<br />
the men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the<br />
hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of<br />
hunger. &#8216;Stranger,&#8217; said she, &#8216;it seems to me that you like starving<br />
in this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you<br />
stick here day after day, without even trying to get away though<br />
your men are dying by inches.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Let me tell you,&#8217; said I, &#8216;whichever of the goddesses you may<br />
happen to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must<br />
have offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for<br />
the gods know everything. which of the immortals it is that is<br />
hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so<br />
as to reach my home.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Stranger,&#8217; replied she, &#8216;I will make it all quite clear to you.<br />
There is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and<br />
whose name is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my<br />
father; he is Neptune&#8217;s head man and knows every inch of ground all<br />
over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight,<br />
he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take,<br />
and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also<br />
tell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house<br />
both good and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous<br />
journey.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Can you show me,&#8217; said I, &#8216;some stratagem by means of which I<br />
may catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?<br />
For a god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Stranger,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I will make it all quite clear to you. About<br />
the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of<br />
the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind<br />
that furs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies<br />
down, and goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals-<br />
Halosydne&#8217;s chickens as they call them- come up also from the grey<br />
sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and<br />
fish-like smell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning I<br />
will take you to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out,<br />
therefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and I will<br />
tell you all the tricks that the old man will play you.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then,<br />
when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go<br />
to sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see<br />
that he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold<br />
him fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will<br />
turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and<br />
will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and<br />
grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and<br />
comes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may<br />
slacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the<br />
gods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach<br />
your home over the seas.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back<br />
to the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart<br />
was clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got<br />
supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.<br />
&#8220;When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the<br />
three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went<br />
along by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the<br />
goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea,<br />
all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her<br />
father. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to<br />
wait till we should come up. When we were close to her, she made us<br />
lie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over<br />
each of us. Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the<br />
stench of the fishy seals was most distressing- who would go to bed<br />
with a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddess<br />
helped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for she<br />
put some ambrosia under each man&#8217;s nostrils, which was so fragrant<br />
that it killed the smell of the seals.<br />
&#8220;We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the<br />
seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the<br />
old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he<br />
went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,<br />
and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as<br />
soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and<br />
seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed<br />
himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he<br />
became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was<br />
running water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck<br />
to him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature<br />
became distressed, and said, Which of the gods was it, Son of<br />
Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing<br />
me against my will? What do you want?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You know that yourself, old man,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;you will gain<br />
nothing by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so<br />
long in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I<br />
am losing all heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything,<br />
which of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also<br />
how I may sail the sea so as to reach my home?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then,&#8217; he said, &#8216;if you would finish your voyage and get home<br />
quickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods<br />
before embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to<br />
your friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the<br />
heaven fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal<br />
gods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you<br />
finish your voyage.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long<br />
and terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, &#8216;I will do<br />
all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me<br />
true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when<br />
we set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them<br />
came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends<br />
when the days of his fighting were done.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Son of Atreus,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;why ask me? You had better not<br />
know what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have<br />
heard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,<br />
but many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the<br />
Achaeans perished during their return home. As for what happened on<br />
the field of battle- you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader<br />
is still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked,<br />
for Neptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he<br />
let him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva&#8217;s<br />
hatred he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by<br />
boasting. He said the gods could not drown him even though they had<br />
tried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized<br />
his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in<br />
two pieces. The base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax<br />
was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he<br />
drank salt water and was drowned.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but<br />
when he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was<br />
caught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely<br />
against his will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to<br />
dwell, but where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it<br />
seemed as though he was to return safely after all, for the gods<br />
backed the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon<br />
Agamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding<br />
himself in his own country.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the<br />
watch, and to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had<br />
been looking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did<br />
not give him the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw<br />
Agamemnon go by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay a<br />
plot for him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them<br />
in ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he<br />
prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to<br />
Agamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He<br />
got him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and<br />
killed him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering an<br />
ox in the shambles; not one of Agamemnon&#8217;s followers was left alive,<br />
nor yet one of Aegisthus&#8217;, but they were all killed there in the<br />
cloisters.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I<br />
sat down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer<br />
bear to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had<br />
had my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of<br />
the sea said, &#8216;Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying<br />
so bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast<br />
as ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and even though Orestes<br />
has beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his<br />
funeral.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, &#8216;I<br />
know, then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man<br />
of whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get<br />
home? or is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;The third man,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I<br />
can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the<br />
nymph Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his<br />
home for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As<br />
for your own end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods<br />
will take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world.<br />
There fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life<br />
than any where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain,<br />
nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that<br />
sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This<br />
will happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove&#8217;s<br />
son-in-law.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to<br />
the ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as<br />
I went along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night<br />
was falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of<br />
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the<br />
water, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went on<br />
board ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea<br />
with our oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream<br />
of Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When<br />
I had thus appeased heaven&#8217;s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of<br />
Agamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which I had a quick<br />
passage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.<br />
&#8220;And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and<br />
I will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present<br />
of a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful<br />
chalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make<br />
a drink-offering to the immortal gods.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;do not press me to stay<br />
longer; I should be contented to remain with you for another twelve<br />
months; I find your conversation so delightful that I should never<br />
once wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left<br />
at Pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As<br />
for any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it<br />
should he a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to<br />
Ithaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have<br />
much flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also<br />
meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white and<br />
spreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor<br />
racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and<br />
I like it the better for that. None of our islands have much level<br />
ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus&#8217;s hand within his own. &#8220;What you<br />
say,&#8221; said he, &#8220;shows that you come of good family. I both can, and<br />
will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most<br />
precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by<br />
Vulcan&#8217;s own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid<br />
with gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the<br />
course of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my<br />
homeward journey. I will make you a present of it.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king&#8217;s<br />
house. They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread<br />
for them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in<br />
the courts].<br />
Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a<br />
mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses&#8217; house, and were<br />
behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who<br />
were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were<br />
sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to<br />
Antinous,<br />
&#8220;Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from<br />
Pylos? He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis:<br />
I have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side<br />
not yet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break<br />
him.&#8221;<br />
They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure<br />
that Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he<br />
was only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or<br />
with the swineherd; so Antinous said, &#8220;When did he go? Tell me<br />
truly, and what young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or<br />
his own bondsmen- for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did<br />
you let him have the ship of your own free will because he asked<br />
you, or did he take it without yourleave?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I lent it him,&#8221; answered Noemon, &#8220;what else could I do when a man<br />
of his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige<br />
him? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him<br />
they were the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board<br />
as captain- or some god who was exactly like him. I cannot<br />
understand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet<br />
he was then setting out for Pylos.&#8221;<br />
Noemon then went back to his father&#8217;s house, but Antinous and<br />
Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,<br />
and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,<br />
Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with<br />
rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:<br />
&#8220;Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter;<br />
we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow<br />
has got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be<br />
giving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full<br />
grown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I<br />
will lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he<br />
will then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his<br />
father.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then<br />
all of them went inside the buildings.<br />
It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were<br />
plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the<br />
outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell<br />
his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:<br />
&#8220;Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the<br />
maids to leave their master&#8217;s business and cook dinner for them? I<br />
wish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor<br />
anywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you<br />
all make of my son&#8217;s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you<br />
were children how good Ulysses had been to them- never doing<br />
anything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say<br />
things sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislike<br />
another, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows<br />
what bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude<br />
left in this world.&#8221;<br />
Then Medon said, &#8220;I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are<br />
plotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate<br />
their design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is<br />
coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news<br />
of his father.&#8221;<br />
Then Penelope&#8217;s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was<br />
speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no<br />
utterance. At last, however, she said, &#8220;Why did my son leave me?<br />
What business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages<br />
over the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving<br />
any one behind him to keep up his name?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; answered Medon, &#8220;whether some god set him on to it,<br />
or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if<br />
his father was dead, or alive and on his way home.&#8221;<br />
Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of<br />
grief. There were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no<br />
heart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself<br />
on the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the<br />
house, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too,<br />
till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,<br />
&#8220;My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction<br />
than any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave<br />
and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and<br />
whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my<br />
darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my<br />
having heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was<br />
not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my<br />
bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I<br />
had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it<br />
up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse<br />
behind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old<br />
Dolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my<br />
gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may<br />
be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,<br />
as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that<br />
of Ulysses.&#8221;<br />
Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, &#8220;You may kill me, Madam, or<br />
let me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell<br />
you the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he<br />
wanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn<br />
oath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,<br />
unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did<br />
not want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your<br />
face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer<br />
prayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save<br />
him even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he<br />
has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate<br />
die race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there will<br />
be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and the<br />
fair fields that lie far all round it.&#8221;<br />
With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried<br />
the tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her<br />
dress, and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised<br />
barley into a basket and began praying to Minerva.<br />
&#8220;Hear me,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,<br />
unweariable. If ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh<br />
bones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and<br />
save my darling son from the villainy of the suitors.&#8221;<br />
She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;<br />
meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered<br />
cloister, and one of them said:<br />
&#8220;The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.<br />
Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.&#8221;<br />
This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to<br />
happen. Then Antinous said, &#8220;Comrades, let there be no loud talking,<br />
lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in<br />
silence, about which we are all of a mind.&#8221;<br />
He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to<br />
the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and<br />
sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted<br />
thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails<br />
aloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then<br />
they made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got<br />
their suppers, and waited till night should fall.<br />
But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,<br />
and wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by<br />
the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen<br />
hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank<br />
into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.<br />
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in<br />
the likeness of Penelope&#8217;s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had<br />
married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to<br />
the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it<br />
came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for<br />
pulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,<br />
&#8220;You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer<br />
you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will<br />
yet come back to you.&#8221;<br />
Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland,<br />
answered, &#8220;Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often,<br />
but I suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I,<br />
then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that<br />
torture me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who<br />
had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all<br />
Hellas and middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on<br />
board of a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to<br />
roughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men. I am even<br />
more anxious about him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble<br />
when I think of him, lest something should happen to him, either<br />
from the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many<br />
enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him<br />
before he can return home.&#8221;<br />
Then the vision said, &#8220;Take heart, and be not so much dismayed.<br />
There is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to<br />
have stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion<br />
upon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Penelope, &#8220;if you are a god or have been sent here by<br />
divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he<br />
still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?&#8221;<br />
And the vision said, &#8220;I shall not tell you for certain whether he is<br />
alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.&#8221;<br />
Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was<br />
dissipated into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed<br />
and comforted, so vivid had been her dream.<br />
Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the<br />
sea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called<br />
Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,<br />
and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here<br />
then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.</p>
<p>
BOOK V</p>
<p>AND NOW, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger of<br />
light alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and with<br />
them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva<br />
began to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied<br />
him away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.<br />
&#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and all you other gods that live in<br />
everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind<br />
and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I<br />
hope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not<br />
one of his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as<br />
though he were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an<br />
island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he<br />
cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships<br />
nor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are<br />
now trying to murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home<br />
from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news<br />
of his father.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What, my dear, are you talking about?&#8221; replied her father, &#8220;did you<br />
not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses<br />
to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to<br />
protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the<br />
suitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, &#8220;Mercury, you<br />
are our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed<br />
that poor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by<br />
gods nor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft<br />
he is to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are<br />
near of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one<br />
of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and<br />
will give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have<br />
brought back from Troy, if he had had had all his prize money and<br />
had got home without disaster. This is how we have settled that he<br />
shall return to his country and his friends.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did<br />
as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals<br />
with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the<br />
wand with which he seals men&#8217;s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as<br />
he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he<br />
swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the<br />
sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing<br />
every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in<br />
the spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last<br />
he got to the island which was his journey&#8217;s end, he left the sea<br />
and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso<br />
lived.<br />
He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the<br />
hearth, and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning<br />
cedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom,<br />
shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singing<br />
beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar,<br />
and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had<br />
built their nests- owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy<br />
their business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained<br />
and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four<br />
running rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, and<br />
turned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and<br />
luscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not help<br />
being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and<br />
looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside<br />
the cave.<br />
Calypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, no<br />
matter how far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within;<br />
he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean<br />
with tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.<br />
Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: &#8220;Why have you come to see me,<br />
Mercury- honoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often?<br />
Say what you want; I will do it for be you at once if I can, and if it<br />
can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before<br />
you.<br />
As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and<br />
mixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had<br />
enough, and then said:<br />
&#8220;We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and<br />
you ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you<br />
would have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could<br />
possibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no<br />
cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?<br />
Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross<br />
Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most<br />
ill-starred of alf those who fought nine years before the city of King<br />
Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On<br />
their way home they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind and<br />
waves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, and<br />
he alone was carried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are<br />
to let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not<br />
perish here, far from his own people, but shall return to his house<br />
and country and see his friends again.&#8221;<br />
Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, &#8220;You gods,&#8221; she<br />
exclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and<br />
hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with<br />
him in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to<br />
Orion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and<br />
killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion,<br />
and yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came to<br />
hear of it before so long and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts.<br />
And now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found<br />
the poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had<br />
struck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all<br />
his crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves<br />
on to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my<br />
heart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all his<br />
days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing;<br />
therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas<br />
again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither<br />
ships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him<br />
such advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring him<br />
safely to his own country.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Then send him away,&#8221; said Mercury, &#8220;or Jove will be angry with<br />
you and punish you&#8221;&#8216;<br />
On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,<br />
for she had heard Jove&#8217;s message. She found him sitting upon the beach<br />
with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer<br />
home-sickness; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was<br />
forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he,<br />
that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks<br />
and on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and<br />
always looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him<br />
said:<br />
&#8220;My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting<br />
your life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free<br />
will; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft<br />
with an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will<br />
put bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I<br />
will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take<br />
you home, if the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more about<br />
these things, and can settle them better than I can.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. &#8220;Now goddess,&#8221; he answered,<br />
&#8220;there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to<br />
help me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on<br />
a raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture on<br />
such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage me go<br />
on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no<br />
mischief.&#8221;<br />
Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: &#8220;You know a<br />
great deal,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above<br />
and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx-<br />
and this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- that<br />
I mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly<br />
what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite<br />
straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry<br />
for you.&#8221;<br />
When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and<br />
Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on<br />
and on till they came to Calypso&#8217;s cave, where Ulysses took the seat<br />
that Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of<br />
the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar<br />
for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were<br />
before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,<br />
Calypso spoke, saying:<br />
&#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your<br />
own land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know<br />
how much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own<br />
country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and<br />
let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this<br />
wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day;<br />
yet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking than<br />
she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should<br />
compare in beauty with an immortal.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Goddess,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;do not be angry with me about this. I<br />
am quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so<br />
beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an<br />
immortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing<br />
else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and<br />
make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and<br />
sea already, so let this go with the rest.&#8221;<br />
Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired<br />
into the inner part of the cave and went to bed.<br />
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put<br />
on his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light<br />
gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden<br />
girdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set<br />
herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave<br />
him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both<br />
sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it.<br />
She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of<br />
the island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine,<br />
that reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail<br />
light for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the<br />
best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which<br />
he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them<br />
smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile<br />
Calypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and<br />
fitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as<br />
broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he<br />
filed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He<br />
also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He<br />
fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection<br />
against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and<br />
by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these<br />
too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of<br />
all, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.<br />
In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth<br />
Calypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some<br />
clean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and<br />
another larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of<br />
provisions, and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the<br />
wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail<br />
before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of<br />
the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the<br />
Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on the Bear- which men also<br />
call the wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facing<br />
Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of Oceanus- for Calypso<br />
had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven and ten did he<br />
sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the<br />
mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,<br />
rising like a shield on the horizon.<br />
But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught<br />
sight of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi.<br />
He could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry,<br />
so he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the<br />
gods have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away<br />
in Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians,<br />
where it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have<br />
befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he<br />
has done with it.&#8221;<br />
Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident,<br />
stirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that<br />
blows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night<br />
sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and<br />
West fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got<br />
up, so that Ulysses&#8217; heart began to fail him. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; he said to<br />
himself in his dismay, &#8220;what ever will become of me? I am afraid<br />
Calypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before<br />
I got back home. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making<br />
heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising from<br />
every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest<br />
were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of the sons of<br />
Atreus. Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were<br />
pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then I<br />
should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my<br />
name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the<br />
raft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let<br />
go the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke<br />
the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea.<br />
For a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to<br />
rise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him<br />
weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out<br />
the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite<br />
of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as<br />
fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board<br />
again so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it<br />
about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road.<br />
It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were all<br />
playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.<br />
When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called<br />
Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had<br />
been since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what<br />
great distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and,<br />
rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.<br />
&#8220;My poor good man,&#8221; said she, &#8220;why is Neptune so furiously angry<br />
with you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his<br />
bluster he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do<br />
then as I bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind,<br />
and swim to the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here,<br />
take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can<br />
come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take<br />
it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away<br />
again.&#8221; With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then<br />
she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark<br />
blue waters.<br />
But Ulysses did not know what to think. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; he said to himself<br />
in his dismay, &#8220;this is only some one or other of the gods who is<br />
luring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate I<br />
will not do so at present, for the land where she said I should be<br />
quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what<br />
I will do- I am sure it will be best- no matter what happens I will<br />
stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the<br />
sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any<br />
better than this.&#8221;<br />
While he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave<br />
that seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the<br />
raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry<br />
chaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank<br />
and rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the<br />
clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino&#8217;s veil under his arms, and<br />
plunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched<br />
him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and<br />
saying, &#8220;&#8216;There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in<br />
with well-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that<br />
I have let you off too lightly.&#8221; On this he lashed his horses and<br />
drove to Aegae where his palace is.<br />
But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all<br />
the winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused<br />
a good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till<br />
Ulysses reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.<br />
Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,<br />
with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but<br />
when the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm<br />
without so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell<br />
he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as<br />
children rejoice when their dear father begins to get better after<br />
having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry<br />
spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful<br />
when he again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength<br />
that he might once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he<br />
got within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up against<br />
the rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrific<br />
roar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbours<br />
where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but only<br />
headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.<br />
Ulysses&#8217; heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to<br />
himself, &#8220;Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that<br />
I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the<br />
coast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer<br />
from the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot<br />
climb out for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will<br />
lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the<br />
water- which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I<br />
swim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a<br />
hurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, or<br />
heaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; for<br />
Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Neptune is very angry<br />
with me.&#8221;<br />
While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with<br />
such force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and<br />
torn to pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold<br />
of the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till<br />
the wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave<br />
came on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing<br />
his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it<br />
from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did the<br />
rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew<br />
him deep down under the water.<br />
Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his<br />
own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him.<br />
He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating<br />
against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the<br />
shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take<br />
the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of<br />
a river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were<br />
no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there<br />
was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:<br />
&#8220;Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger<br />
of the sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who<br />
has lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,<br />
wherefore in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to<br />
the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare<br />
myself your suppliant.&#8221;<br />
Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all<br />
calm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the<br />
river. Here at last Ulysses&#8217; knees and strong hands failed him, for<br />
the sea had completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his<br />
mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he<br />
could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer<br />
exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to<br />
himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and<br />
threw it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Ino<br />
received it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her.<br />
Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissed<br />
the bounteous earth.<br />
&#8220;Alas,&#8221; he cried to himself in his dismay, &#8220;what ever will become of<br />
me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed<br />
through the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the<br />
bitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise<br />
there will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other<br />
hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in<br />
some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night&#8217;s rest,<br />
but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.&#8221;<br />
In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found<br />
one upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept<br />
beneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one<br />
an ungrafted sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind,<br />
however squally, could break through the cover they afforded, nor<br />
could the sun&#8217;s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so<br />
closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these<br />
and began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great<br />
litter of dead leaves lying about- enough to make a covering for two<br />
or three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to see<br />
this, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him.<br />
Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor,<br />
hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having to<br />
get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with<br />
leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his<br />
eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows.</p>
