				<p>THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS</p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; AEneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezen-<br />
tius, grants a truce for burying the dead, and sends home the<br />
body of Pallas with great solemnity. Latinus calls a council, to<br />
propose offers of peace to AEneas; which occasions great animosity<br />
betwixt Turnus and Drances. In the mean time there is a sharp<br />
engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalizes herself; is<br />
kill&#8217;d; and the Latine troops are entirely defeated.</p>
<p>SCARCE had the rosy Morning rais&#8217;d her head <br />
Above the waves, and left her wat&#8217;ry bed; <br />
The pious chief, whom double cares attend <br />
For his unburied soldiers and his friend, <br />
Yet first to Heav&#8217;n perform&#8217;d a victor&#8217;s vows: <br />
He bar&#8217;d an ancient oak of all her boughs; <br />
Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac&#8217;d, <br />
Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac&#8217;d. <br />
The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn, <br />
Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, <br />
Was hung on high, and glitter&#8217;d from afar, <br />
A trophy sacred to the God of War. <br />
Above his arms, fix&#8217;d on the leafless wood, <br />
Appear&#8217;d his plumy crest, besmear&#8217;d with blood: <br />
His brazen buckler on the left was seen; <br />
Truncheons of shiver&#8217;d lances hung between; <br />
And on the right was placed his corslet, bor&#8217;d; <br />
And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword. <br />
A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man, <br />
Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: <br />
&#8220;Our toils, my friends, are crown&#8217;d with sure success; <br />
The greater part perform&#8217;d, achieve the less. <br />
Now follow cheerful to the trembling town; <br />
Press but an entrance, and presume it won. <br />
Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, <br />
As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. <br />
Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, <br />
And, in this omen, is already slain. <br />
Prepar&#8217;d in arms, pursue your happy chance; <br />
That none unwarn&#8217;d may plead his ignorance, <br />
And I, at Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s appointed hour, may find <br />
Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. <br />
Meantime the rites and fun&#8217;ral pomps prepare, <br />
Due to your dead companions of the war: <br />
The last respect the living can bestow, <br />
To shield their shadows from contempt below. <br />
That conquer&#8217;d earth be theirs, for which they fought, <br />
And which for us with their own blood they bought; <br />
But first the corpse of our unhappy friend <br />
To the sad city of Evander send, <br />
Who, not inglorious, in his age&#8217;s bloom, <br />
Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.&#8221; <br />
Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, <br />
Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. <br />
Acoetes watch&#8217;d the corpse; whose youth deserv&#8217;d <br />
The father&#8217;s trust; and now the son he serv&#8217;d <br />
With equal faith, but less auspicious care. <br />
Th&#8217; attendants of the slain his sorrow share. <br />
A troop of Trojans mix&#8217;d with these appear, <br />
And mourning matrons with dishevel&#8217;d hair. <br />
Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; <br />
All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. <br />
They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; <br />
But, when AEneas view&#8217;d the grisly wound <br />
Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, <br />
And the fair flesh distain&#8217;d with purple gore; <br />
First, melting into tears, the pious man <br />
Deplor&#8217;d so sad a sight, then thus began: <br />
&#8220;Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest <br />
Of my full wishes, she refus&#8217;d the best! <br />
She came; but brought not thee along, to bless <br />
My longing eyes, and share in my success: <br />
She grudg&#8217;d thy safe return, the triumphs due <br />
To prosp&#8217;rous valor, in the public view. <br />
Not thus I promis&#8217;d, when thy father lent <br />
Thy needless succor with a sad consent; <br />
Embrac&#8217;d me, parting for th&#8217; Etrurian land, <br />
And sent me to possess a large command. <br />
He warn&#8217;d, and from his own experience told, <br />
Our foes were warlike, disciplin&#8217;d, and bold. <br />
And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, <br />
Rich odors on his loaded altars burn, <br />
While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare <br />
To send him back his portion of the war, <br />
A bloody breathless body, which can owe <br />
No farther debt, but to the pow&#8217;rs below. <br />
The wretched father, ere his race is run, <br />
Shall view the fun&#8217;ral honors of his son. <br />
These are my triumphs of the Latian war, <br />
Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care! <br />
And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see <br />
A son whose death disgrac&#8217;d his ancestry; <br />
Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev&#8217;d: <br />
Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv&#8217;d. <br />
He died no death to make thee wish, too late, <br />
Thou hadst not liv&#8217;d to see his shameful fate: <br />
But what a champion has th&#8217; Ausonian coast, <br />
And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!&#8221; <br />
Thus having mourn&#8217;d, he gave the word around, <br />
To raise the breathless body from the ground; <br />
And chose a thousand horse, the flow&#8217;r of all <br />
His warlike troops, to wait the funeral, <br />
To bear him back and share Evander&#8217;s grief: <br />
A well-becoming, but a weak relief. <br />
Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, <br />
Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear. <br />
The body on this rural hearse is borne: <br />
Strew&#8217;d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. <br />
All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow&#8217;r, <br />
New cropp&#8217;d by virgin hands, to dress the bow&#8217;r: <br />
Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, <br />
No more to mother earth or the green stem shall owe. <br />
Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost, <br />
Of purple woven, and with gold emboss&#8217;d, <br />
For ornament the Trojan hero brought, <br />
Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought. <br />
One vest array&#8217;d the corpse; and one they spread <br />
O&#8217;er his clos&#8217;d eyes, and wrapp&#8217;d around his head, <br />
That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall, <br />
The catching fire might burn the golden caul. <br />
Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain, <br />
When he descended on the Latian plain; <br />
Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led <br />
In long array&#8211;th&#8217; achievements of the dead. <br />
Then, pinion&#8217;d with their hands behind, appear <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy captives, marching in the rear, <br />
Appointed off&#8217;rings in the victor&#8217;s name, <br />
To sprinkle with their blood the fun&#8217;ral flame. <br />
Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne; <br />
Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn; <br />
And fair inscriptions fix&#8217;d, and titles read <br />
Of Latian leaders conquer&#8217;d by the dead. <br />
Acoetes on his pupil&#8217;s corpse attends, <br />
With feeble steps, supported by his friends. <br />
Pausing at ev&#8217;ry pace, in sorrow drown&#8217;d, <br />
Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; <br />
Where grov&#8217;ling while he lies in deep despair, <br />
He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. <br />
The champion&#8217;s chariot next is seen to roll, <br />
Besmear&#8217;d with hostile blood, and honorably foul. <br />
To close the pomp, AEthon, the steed of state, <br />
Is led, the fun&#8217;rals of his lord to wait. <br />
Stripp&#8217;d of his trappings, with a sullen pace <br />
He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face. <br />
The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest, <br />
Are borne behind: the victor seiz&#8217;d the rest. <br />
The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; <br />
The pikes and lances trail along the ground. <br />
Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse <br />
To Pallantean tow&#8217;rs direct their course, <br />
In long procession rank&#8217;d, the pious chief <br />
Stopp&#8217;d in the rear, and gave a vent to grief: <br />
&#8220;The public care,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which war attends, <br />
Diverts our present woes, at least suspends. <br />
Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell! <br />
Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!&#8221; <br />
He said no more, but, inly thro&#8217; he mourn&#8217;d, <br />
Restrain&#8217;d his tears, and to the camp return&#8217;d. <br />
Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand <br />
A truce, with olive branches in their hand; <br />
Obtest his clemency, and from the plain <br />
Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. <br />
They plead, that none those common rites deny <br />
To conquer&#8217;d foes that in fair battle die. <br />
All cause of hate was ended in their death; <br />
Nor could he war with bodies void of breath. <br />
A king, they hop&#8217;d, would hear a king&#8217;s request, <br />
Whose son he once was call&#8217;d, and once his guest. <br />
Their suit, which was too just to be denied, <br />
The hero grants, and farther thus replied: <br />
&#8220;O Latian princes, how severe a fate <br />
In causeless quarrels has involv&#8217;d your state, <br />
And arm&#8217;d against an unoffending man, <br />
Who sought your friendship ere the war began! <br />
You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, <br />
Not only for the slain, but those who live. <br />
I came not hither but by Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s command, <br />
And sent by fate to share the Latian land. <br />
Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied <br />
My proffer&#8217;d friendship, and my promis&#8217;d bride; <br />
Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try <br />
His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. <br />
My right and his are in dispute: the slain <br />
Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. <br />
In equal arms let us alone contend; <br />
And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. <br />
This is the way (so tell him) to possess <br />
The royal virgin, and restore the peace. <br />
Bear this message back, with ample leave, <br />
That your slain friends may fun&#8217;ral rites receive.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said&#8211;th&#8217; embassadors, amaz&#8217;d, <br />
Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz&#8217;d. <br />
Drances, their chief, who harbor&#8217;d in his breast <br />
Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess&#8217;d, <br />
Broke silence first, and to the godlike man, <br />
With graceful action bowing, thus began: <br />
&#8220;Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, <br />
But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; <br />
Would I your justice or your force express, <br />
Thought can but equal; and all words are less. <br />
Your answer we shall thankfully relate, <br />
And favors granted to the Latian state. <br />
If wish&#8217;d success our labor shall attend, <br />
Think peace concluded, and the king your friend: <br />
Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, <br />
And seek alliance in some other land: <br />
Build you the city which your fates assign; <br />
We shall be proud in the great work to join.&#8221; <br />
Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade <br />
The rest impower&#8217;d, that soon a truce is made. <br />
Twelve days the term allow&#8217;d: and, during those, <br />
Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, <br />
Mix&#8217;d in the woods, for fun&#8217;ral piles prepare <br />
To fell the timber, and forget the war. <br />
Loud axes thro&#8217; the groaning groves resound; <br />
Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground; <br />
First fall from high; and some the trunks receive <br />
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. <br />
And now the fatal news by Fame is blown <br />
Thro&#8217; the short circuit of th&#8217; Arcadian town, <br />
Of Pallas slain&#8211;by Fame, which just before <br />
His triumphs on distended pinions bore. <br />
Rushing from out the gate, the people stand, <br />
Each with a fun&#8217;ral flambeau in his hand. <br />
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: <br />
The fields are lighten&#8217;d with a fiery blaze, <br />
That cast a sullen splendor on their friends, <br />
The marching troop which their dead prince attends. <br />
Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; <br />
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, <br />
And their mix&#8217;d mourning rends the vaulted sky. <br />
The town is fill&#8217;d with tumult and with tears, <br />
Till the loud clamors reach Evander&#8217;s ears: <br />
Forgetful of his state, he runs along, <br />
With a disorder&#8217;d pace, and cleaves the throng; <br />
Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, <br />
With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. <br />
Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks <br />
A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: <br />
&#8220;O Pallas! thou hast fail&#8217;d thy plighted word, <br />
To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword! <br />
I warn&#8217;d thee, but in vain; for well I knew <br />
What perils youthful ardor would pursue, <br />
That boiling blood would carry thee too far, <br />
Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! <br />
O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom, <br />
Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! <br />
Hard elements of unauspicious war, <br />
Vain vows to Heav&#8217;n, and unavailing care! <br />
Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed, <br />
Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled, <br />
Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind, <br />
To drink the dregs of life by fate assign&#8217;d! <br />
Beyond the goal of nature I have gone: <br />
My Pallas late set out, but reach&#8217;d too soon. <br />
If, for my league against th&#8217; Ausonian state, <br />
Amidst their weapons I had found my fate, <br />
(Deserv&#8217;d from them,) then I had been return&#8217;d <br />
A breathless victor, and my son had mourn&#8217;d. <br />
Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid, <br />
Nor grudge th&#8217; alliance I so gladly made. <br />
&#8216;T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young, <br />
But my own crime, for having liv&#8217;d too long. <br />
Yet, since the gods had destin&#8217;d him to die, <br />
At least he led the way to victory: <br />
First for his friends he won the fatal shore, <br />
And sent whole herds of slaughter&#8217;d foes before; <br />
A death too great, too glorious to deplore. <br />
Nor will I add new honors to thy grave, <br />
Content with those the Trojan hero gave: <br />
That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design&#8217;d, <br />
In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join&#8217;d. <br />
Great spoils and trophies, gain&#8217;d by thee, they bear: <br />
Then let thy own achievements be thy share. <br />
Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, <br />
Whose mighty trunk had better grac&#8217;d the wood, <br />
If Pallas had arriv&#8217;d, with equal length <br />
Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. <br />
But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain <br />
These troops, to view the tears thou shedd&#8217;st in vain? <br />
Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: <br />
Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, <br />
And, after Pallas&#8217; death, live ling&#8217;ring on, <br />
&#8216;T is to behold his vengeance for my son. <br />
I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head <br />
Is owing to the living and the dead. <br />
My son and I expect it from his hand; <br />
&#8216;T is all that he can give, or we demand. <br />
Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, <br />
To greet my Pallas with such news below.&#8221; <br />
The morn had now dispell&#8217;d the shades of night, <br />
Restoring toils, when she restor&#8217;d the light. <br />
The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command <br />
To raise the piles along the winding strand. <br />
Their friends convey the dead to fun&#8217;ral fires; <br />
Black smold&#8217;ring smoke from the green wood expires; <br />
The light of heav&#8217;n is chok&#8217;d, and the new day retires. <br />
Then thrice around the kindled piles they go <br />
(For ancient custom had ordain&#8217;d it so); <br />
Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; <br />
And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. <br />
Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, <br />
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. <br />
Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw <br />
The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: <br />
Helms, bits emboss&#8217;d, and swords of shining steel; <br />
One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; <br />
Some to their fellows their own arms restore: <br />
The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore, <br />
Their bucklers pierc&#8217;d, their darts bestow&#8217;d in vain, <br />
And shiver&#8217;d lances gather&#8217;d from the plain. <br />
Whole herds of offer&#8217;d bulls, about the fire, <br />
And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire. <br />
Around the piles a careful troop attends, <br />
To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends; <br />
Ling&#8217;ring along the shore, till dewy night <br />
New decks the face of heav&#8217;n with starry light. <br />
The conquer&#8217;d Latians, with like pious care, <br />
Piles without number for their dead prepare. <br />
Part in the places where they fell are laid; <br />
And part are to the neighb&#8217;ring fields convey&#8217;d. <br />
The corps of kings, and captains of renown, <br />
Borne off in state, are buried in the town; <br />
The rest, unhonor&#8217;d, and without a name, <br />
Are cast a common heap to feed the flame. <br />
Trojans and Latians vie with like desires <br />
To make the field of battle shine with fires, <br />
And the promiscuous blaze to heav&#8217;n aspires. <br />
Now had the morning thrice renew&#8217;d the light, <br />
And thrice dispell&#8217;d the shadows of the night, <br />
When those who round the wasted fires remain, <br />
Perform the last sad office to the slain. <br />
They rake the yet warm ashes from below; <br />
These, and the bones unburn&#8217;d, in earth bestow; <br />
These relics with their country rites they grace, <br />
And raise a mount of turf to mark the place. <br />
But, in the palace of the king, appears <br />
A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. <br />
Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans; <br />
Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons. <br />
All in that universal sorrow share, <br />
And curse the cause of this unhappy war: <br />
A broken league, a bride unjustly sought, <br />
A crown usurp&#8217;d, which with their blood is bought! <br />
These are the crimes with which they load the name <br />
Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: <br />
&#8220;Let him who lords it o&#8217;er th&#8217; Ausonian land <br />
Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand: <br />
His is the gain; our lot is but to serve; <br />
&#8216;T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.&#8221; <br />
This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite: <br />
&#8220;His foe expects, and dares him to the fight.&#8221; <br />
Nor Turnus wants a party, to support <br />
His cause and credit in the Latian court. <br />
His former acts secure his present fame, <br />
And the queen shades him with her mighty name. <br />
While thus their factious minds with fury burn, <br />
The legates from th&#8217; AEtolian prince return: <br />
Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost <br />
And care employ&#8217;d, their embassy is lost; <br />
That Diomedes refus&#8217;d his aid in war, <br />
Unmov&#8217;d with presents, and as deaf to pray&#8217;r. <br />
Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought, <br />
Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. <br />
Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, <br />
A foreign son is pointed out by fate; <br />
And, till AEneas shall Lavinia wed, <br />
The wrath of Heav&#8217;n is hov&#8217;ring o&#8217;er his head. <br />
The gods, he saw, espous&#8217;d the juster side, <br />
When late their titles in the field were tried: <br />
Witness the fresh laments, and fun&#8217;ral tears undried. <br />
Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all <br />
The Latian senate to the council hall. <br />
The princes come, commanded by their head, <br />
And crowd the paths that to the palace lead. <br />
Supreme in pow&#8217;r, and reverenc&#8217;d for his years, <br />
He takes the throne, and in the midst appears. <br />
Majestically sad, he sits in state, <br />
And bids his envoys their success relate. <br />
When Venulus began, the murmuring sound <br />
Was hush&#8217;d, and sacred silence reign&#8217;d around. <br />
&#8220;We have,&#8221; said he, &#8220;perform&#8217;d your high command, <br />
And pass&#8217;d with peril a long tract of land: <br />
We reach&#8217;d the place desir&#8217;d; with wonder fill&#8217;d, <br />
The Grecian tents and rising tow&#8217;rs beheld. <br />
Great Diomede has compass&#8217;d round with walls <br />
The city, which Argyripa he calls, <br />
From his own Argos nam&#8217;d. We touch&#8217;d, with joy, <br />
The royal hand that raz&#8217;d unhappy Troy. <br />
When introduc&#8217;d, our presents first we bring, <br />
Then crave an instant audience from the king. <br />
His leave obtain&#8217;d, our native soil we name, <br />
And tell th&#8217; important cause for which we came. <br />
Attentively he heard us, while we spoke; <br />
Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, <br />
Made this return: &#8216;Ausonian race, of old <br />
Renown&#8217;d for peace, and for an age of gold, <br />
What madness has your alter&#8217;d minds possess&#8217;d, <br />
To change for war hereditary rest, <br />
Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword, <br />
A needless ill your ancestors abhorr&#8217;d? <br />
We&#8211;for myself I speak, and all the name <br />
Of Grecians, who to Troy&#8217;s destruction came, <br />
Omitting those who were in battle slain, <br />
Or borne by rolling Simois to the main&#8211; <br />
Not one but suffer&#8217;d, and too dearly bought <br />
The prize of honor which in arms he sought; <br />
Some doom&#8217;d to death, and some in exile driv&#8217;n, <br />
Outcasts, abandon&#8217;d by the care of Heav&#8217;n; <br />
So worn, so wretched, so despis&#8217;d a crew, <br />
As ev&#8217;n old Priam might with pity view. <br />
Witness the vessels by Minerva toss&#8217;d <br />
In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast; <br />
Th&#8217; Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led <br />
Our armies to revenge his injur&#8217;d bed, <br />
In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men <br />
Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops&#8217; den. <br />
Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain <br />
Restor&#8217;d to scepters, and expell&#8217;d again? <br />
Or young Achilles, by his rival slain? <br />
Ev&#8217;n he, the King of Men, the foremost name <br />
Of all the Greeks, and most renown&#8217;d by fame, <br />
The proud revenger of another&#8217;s wife, <br />
Yet by his own adult&#8217;ress lost his life; <br />
Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy <br />
The foul polluters of his bed enjoy. <br />
The gods have envied me the sweets of life, <br />
My much lov&#8217;d country, and my more lov&#8217;d wife: <br />
Banish&#8217;d from both, I mourn; while in the sky, <br />
Transform&#8217;d to birds, my lost companions fly: <br />
Hov&#8217;ring about the coasts, they make their moan, <br />
And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. <br />
What squalid specters, in the dead of night, <br />
Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight! <br />
I might have promis&#8217;d to myself those harms, <br />
Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms, <br />
Presum&#8217;d against immortal pow&#8217;rs to move, <br />
And violate with wounds the Queen of Love. <br />
Such arms this hand shall never more employ; <br />
No hate remains with me to ruin&#8217;d Troy. <br />
I war not with its dust; nor am I glad <br />
To think of past events, or good or bad. <br />
Your presents I return: whate&#8217;er you bring <br />
To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king. <br />
We met in fight; I know him, to my cost: <br />
With what a whirling force his lance he toss&#8217;d! <br />
Heav&#8217;ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! <br />
How high he held his shield, and rose at ev&#8217;ry blow! <br />
Had Troy produc&#8217;d two more his match in might, <br />
They would have chang&#8217;d the fortune of the fight: <br />
Th&#8217; invasion of the Greeks had been return&#8217;d, <br />
Our empire wasted, and our cities burn&#8217;d. <br />
The long defense the Trojan people made, <br />
The war protracted, and the siege delay&#8217;d, <br />
Were due to Hector&#8217;s and this hero&#8217;s hand: <br />
Both brave alike, and equal in command; <br />
AEneas, not inferior in the field, <br />
In pious reverence to the gods excell&#8217;d. <br />
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care <br />
Th&#8217; impending dangers of a fatal war.&#8217; <br />
He said no more; but, with this cold excuse, <br />
Refus&#8217;d th&#8217; alliance, and advis&#8217;d a truce.&#8221; <br />
Thus Venulus concluded his report. <br />
A jarring murmur fill&#8217;d the factious court: <br />
As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, <br />
And dashes o&#8217;er the stones that stop the course, <br />
The flood, constrain&#8217;d within a scanty space, <br />
Roars horrible along th&#8217; uneasy race; <br />
White foam in gath&#8217;ring eddies floats around; <br />
The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. <br />
The murmur ceas&#8217;d: then from his lofty throne <br />
The king invok&#8217;d the gods, and thus begun: <br />
&#8220;I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate <br />
Had been resolv&#8217;d before it was too late. <br />
Much better had it been for you and me, <br />
Unforc&#8217;d by this our last necessity, <br />
To have been earlier wise, than now to call <br />
A council, when the foe surrounds the wall. <br />
O citizens, we wage unequal war, <br />
With men not only Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s peculiar care, <br />
But Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s own race; unconquer&#8217;d in the field, <br />
Or, conquer&#8217;d, yet unknowing how to yield. <br />
What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down: <br />
Our hopes must center on ourselves alone. <br />
Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, <br />
You see too well; nor need my words explain. <br />
Vanquish&#8217;d without resource; laid flat by fate; <br />
Factions within, a foe without the gate! <br />
Not but I grant that all perform&#8217;d their parts <br />
With manly force, and with undaunted hearts: <br />
With our united strength the war we wag&#8217;d; <br />
With equal numbers, equal arms, engag&#8217;d. <br />
You see th&#8217; event.&#8211;Now hear what I propose, <br />
To save our friends, and satisfy our foes. <br />
A tract of land the Latins have possess&#8217;d <br />
Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, <br />
Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till, <br />
And their mix&#8217;d cattle graze the fruitful hill. <br />
Those mountains fill&#8217;d with firs, that lower land, <br />
If you consent, the Trojan shall command, <br />
Call&#8217;d into part of what is ours; and there, <br />
On terms agreed, the common country share. <br />
There let &#8216;em build and settle, if they please; <br />
Unless they choose once more to cross the seas, <br />
In search of seats remote from Italy, <br />
And from unwelcome inmates set us free. <br />
Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, <br />
Or twice as many more, if more they need. <br />
Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood <br />
Runs equal with the margin of the flood: <br />
Let them the number and the form assign; <br />
The care and cost of all the stores be mine. <br />
To treat the peace, a hundred senators <br />
Shall be commission&#8217;d hence with ample pow&#8217;rs, <br />
With olive crown&#8217;d: the presents they shall bear, <br />
A purple robe, a royal iv&#8217;ry chair, <br />
And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear, <br />
And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate <br />
This great affair, and save the sinking state.&#8221; <br />
Then Drances took the word, who grudg&#8217;d, long since, <br />
The rising glories of the Daunian prince. <br />
Factious and rich, bold at the council board, <br />
But cautious in the field, he shunn&#8217;d the sword; <br />
A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord. <br />
Noble his mother was, and near the throne; <br />
But, what his father&#8217;s parentage, unknown. <br />
He rose, and took th&#8217; advantage of the times, <br />
To load young Turnus with invidious crimes. <br />
&#8220;Such truths, O king,&#8221; said he, &#8220;your words contain, <br />
As strike the sense, and all replies are vain; <br />
Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek <br />
What common needs require, but fear to speak. <br />
Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man, <br />
Whose pride this unauspicious war began; <br />
For whose ambition (let me dare to say, <br />
Fear set apart, tho&#8217; death is in my way) <br />
The plains of Latium run with blood around. <br />
So many valiant heroes bite the ground; <br />
Dejected grief in ev&#8217;ry face appears; <br />
A town in mourning, and a land in tears; <br />
While he, th&#8217; undoubted author of our harms, <br />
The man who menaces the gods with arms, <br />
Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, <br />
And sought his safety in ignoble flight. <br />
Now, best of kings, since you propose to send <br />
Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; <br />
Add yet a greater at our joint request, <br />
One which he values more than all the rest: <br />
Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride; <br />
With that alliance let the league be tied, <br />
And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide. <br />
Let insolence no longer awe the throne; <br />
But, with a father&#8217;s right, bestow your own. <br />
For this maligner of the general good, <br />
If still we fear his force, he must be woo&#8217;d; <br />
His haughty godhead we with pray&#8217;rs implore, <br />
Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore. <br />
O cursed cause of all our ills, must we <br />
Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee! <br />
What right hast thou to rule the Latian state, <br />
And send us out to meet our certain fate? <br />
&#8216;T is a destructive war: from Turnus&#8217; hand <br />
Our peace and public safety we demand. <br />
Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain; <br />
If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. <br />
Turnus, I know you think me not your friend, <br />
Nor will I much with your belief contend: <br />
I beg your greatness not to give the law <br />
In others&#8217; realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. <br />
Pity your own, or pity our estate; <br />
Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate. <br />
Your interest is, the war should never cease; <br />
But we have felt enough to wish the peace: <br />
A land exhausted to the last remains, <br />
Depopulated towns, and driven plains. <br />
Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow&#8217;r, <br />
A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow&#8217;r, <br />
So fire your mind, in arms assert your right, <br />
And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight. <br />
Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone; <br />
We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne: <br />
A base ignoble crowd, without a name, <br />
Unwept, unworthy, of the fun&#8217;ral flame, <br />
By duty bound to forfeit each his life, <br />
That Turnus may possess a royal wife. <br />
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew <br />
Should share such triumphs, and detain from you <br />
The post of honor, your undoubted due. <br />
Rather alone your matchless force employ, <br />
To merit what alone you must enjoy.&#8221; <br />
These words, so full of malice mix&#8217;d with art, <br />
Inflam&#8217;d with rage the youthful hero&#8217;s heart. <br />
Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast, <br />
He heav&#8217;d for wind, and thus his wrath express&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;You, Drances, never want a stream of words, <br />
Then, when the public need requires our swords. <br />
First in the council hall to steer the state, <br />
And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, <br />
While our strong walls secure us from the foe, <br />
Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: <br />
But let the potent orator declaim, <br />
And with the brand of coward blot my name; <br />
Free leave is giv&#8217;n him, when his fatal hand <br />
Has cover&#8217;d with more corps the sanguine strand, <br />
And high as mine his tow&#8217;ring trophies stand. <br />
If any doubt remains, who dares the most, <br />
Let us decide it at the Trojan&#8217;s cost, <br />
And issue both abreast, where honor calls&#8211; <br />
Foes are not far to seek without the walls&#8211; <br />
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, <br />
And feet were giv&#8217;n him but to speed his flight. <br />
I beaten from the field? I forc&#8217;d away? <br />
Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say? <br />
Had he but ev&#8217;n beheld the fight, his eyes <br />
Had witness&#8217;d for me what his tongue denies: <br />
What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain, <br />
And how the bloody Tiber swell&#8217;d the main. <br />
All saw, but he, th&#8217; Arcadian troops retire <br />
In scatter&#8217;d squadrons, and their prince expire. <br />
The giant brothers, in their camp, have found, <br />
I was not forc&#8217;d with ease to quit my ground. <br />
Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos&#8217;d, <br />
I singly their united arms oppos&#8217;d: <br />
First forc&#8217;d an entrance thro&#8217; their thick array; <br />
Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. <br />
&#8216;T is a destructive war? So let it be, <br />
But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee! <br />
Meantime proceed to fill the people&#8217;s ears <br />
With false reports, their minds with panic fears: <br />
Extol the strength of a twice-conquer&#8217;d race; <br />
Our foes encourage, and our friends debase. <br />
Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town <br />
Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o&#8217;erthrown; <br />
Suppliant at Hector&#8217;s feet Achilles lies, <br />
And Diomede from fierce AEneas flies. <br />
Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread <br />
Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head, <br />
When the great Trojan on his bank appears; <br />
For that&#8217;s as true as thy dissembled fears <br />
Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity: <br />
Thou, Drances, art below a death from me. <br />
Let that vile soul in that vile body rest; <br />
The lodging is well worthy of the guest. <br />
&#8220;Now, royal father, to the present state <br />
Of our affairs, and of this high debate: <br />
If in your arms thus early you diffide, <br />
And think your fortune is already tried; <br />
If one defeat has brought us down so low, <br />
As never more in fields to meet the foe; <br />
Then I conclude for peace: &#8216;t is time to treat, <br />
And lie like vassals at the victor&#8217;s feet. <br />
But, O! if any ancient blood remains, <br />
One drop of all our fathers&#8217;, in our veins, <br />
That man would I prefer before the rest, <br />
Who dar&#8217;d his death with an undaunted breast; <br />
Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound, <br />
To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw&#8217;d the ground. <br />
But, if we still have fresh recruits in store, <br />
If our confederates can afford us more; <br />
If the contended field we bravely fought, <br />
And not a bloodless victory was bought; <br />
Their losses equal&#8217;d ours; and, for their slain, <br />
With equal fires they fill&#8217;d the shining plain; <br />
Why thus, unforc&#8217;d, should we so tamely yield, <br />
And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? <br />
Good unexpected, evils unforeseen, <br />
Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene: <br />
Some, rais&#8217;d aloft, come tumbling down amain; <br />
Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. <br />
If Diomede refuse his aid to lend, <br />
The great Messapus yet remains our friend: <br />
Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours; <br />
Th&#8217; Italian chiefs and princes join their pow&#8217;rs: <br />
Nor least in number, nor in name the last, <br />
Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac&#8217;d <br />
Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon <br />
Contains an army in herself alone, <br />
And heads a squadron, terrible to sight, <br />
With glitt&#8217;ring shields, in brazen armor bright. <br />
Yet, if the foe a single fight demand, <br />
And I alone the public peace withstand; <br />
If you consent, he shall not be refus&#8217;d, <br />
Nor find a hand to victory unus&#8217;d. <br />
This new Achilles, let him take the field, <br />
With fated armor, and Vulcanian shield! <br />
For you, my royal father, and my fame, <br />
I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, <br />
Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand, <br />
And I alone will answer his demand. <br />
Drances shall rest secure, and neither share <br />
The danger, nor divide the prize of war.&#8221; <br />
While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, <br />
AEneas draws his forces to the field, <br />
And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed <br />
Return, and thro&#8217; the frighted city spread <br />
Th&#8217; unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, <br />
In battle marching by the river side, <br />
And bending to the town. They take th&#8217; alarm: <br />
Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. <br />
Th&#8217; impetuous youth press forward to the field; <br />
They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: <br />
The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; <br />
Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; <br />
A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, <br />
Like that of swans remurm&#8217;ring to the floods, <br />
Or birds of diff&#8217;ring kinds in hollow woods. <br />
Turnus th&#8217; occasion takes, and cries aloud: <br />
&#8220;Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: <br />
Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, <br />
And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, <br />
Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: <br />
&#8220;Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command <br />
To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. <br />
Messapus and Catillus, post your force <br />
Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. <br />
Some guard the passes, others man the wall; <br />
Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.&#8221; <br />
They swarm from ev&#8217;ry quarter of the town, <br />
And with disorder&#8217;d haste the rampires crown. <br />
Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, <br />
The gath&#8217;ring storm just breaking on the state, <br />
Dismiss&#8217;d the council till a fitter time, <br />
And own&#8217;d his easy temper as his crime, <br />
Who, forc&#8217;d against his reason, had complied <br />
To break the treaty for the promis&#8217;d bride. <br />
Some help to sink new trenches; others aid <br />
To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. <br />
Hoarse trumpets sound th&#8217; alarm; around the walls <br />
Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls. <br />
A sad procession in the streets is seen, <br />
Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: <br />
High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, <br />
With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. <br />
They mount the cliff, where Pallas&#8217; temple stands; <br />
Pray&#8217;rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, <br />
With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, <br />
Then in this common supplication join: <br />
&#8220;O patroness of arms, unspotted maid, <br />
Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! <br />
Break short the pirate&#8217;s lance; pronounce his fate, <br />
And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.&#8221; <br />
Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast <br />
Well-temper&#8217;d steel and scaly brass invest: <br />
The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold <br />
Are mingled metal damask&#8217;d o&#8217;er with gold. <br />
His faithful fauchion sits upon his side; <br />
Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: <br />
But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, <br />
With godlike grace, he from the tow&#8217;r descends. <br />
Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare <br />
His absent rival, and to promise war. <br />
Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins, <br />
The wanton courser prances o&#8217;er the plains, <br />
Or in the pride of youth o&#8217;erleaps the mounds, <br />
And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds. <br />
Or seeks his wat&#8217;ring in the well-known flood, <br />
To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood: <br />
He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, <br />
And o&#8217;er his shoulder flows his waving mane: <br />
He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high; <br />
Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly. <br />
Soon as the prince appears without the gate, <br />
The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait <br />
His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien, <br />
Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen: <br />
Her squadron imitates, and each descends; <br />
Whose common suit Camilla thus commends: <br />
&#8220;If sense of honor, if a soul secure <br />
Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure, <br />
Can promise aught, or on itself rely <br />
Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die; <br />
Then, I alone, sustain&#8217;d by these, will meet <br />
The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat. <br />
Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown: <br />
You, gen&#8217;ral, stay behind, and guard the town:&#8221; <br />
Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise, <br />
And on the fierce virago fix&#8217;d his eyes; <br />
Then thus return&#8217;d: &#8220;O grace of Italy, <br />
With what becoming thanks can I reply? <br />
Not only words lie lab&#8217;ring in my breast, <br />
But thought itself is by thy praise oppress&#8217;d. <br />
Yet rob me not of all; but let me join <br />
My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine. <br />
The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill&#8217;d, <br />
Sends his light horse before to scour the field: <br />
Himself, thro&#8217; steep ascents and thorny brakes, <br />
A larger compass to the city takes. <br />
This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare <br />
To foil his cunning, and his force to dare; <br />
With chosen foot his passage to forelay, <br />
And place an ambush in the winding way. <br />
Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse; <br />
The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce <br />
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band, <br />
Subjected all to thy supreme command.&#8221; <br />
This said, he warns Messapus to the war, <br />
Then ev&#8217;ry chief exhorts with equal care. <br />
All thus encourag&#8217;d, his own troops he joins, <br />
And hastes to prosecute his deep designs. <br />
Inclos&#8217;d with hills, a winding valley lies, <br />
By nature form&#8217;d for fraud, and fitted for surprise. <br />
A narrow track, by human steps untrode, <br />
Leads, thro&#8217; perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. <br />
High o&#8217;er the vale a steepy mountain stands, <br />
Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. <br />
The top is level, an offensive seat <br />
Of war; and from the war a safe retreat: <br />
For, on the right and left, is room to press <br />
The foes at hand, or from afar distress; <br />
To drive &#8216;em headlong downward, and to pour <br />
On their descending backs a stony show&#8217;r. <br />
Thither young Turnus took the well-known way, <br />
Possess&#8217;d the pass, and in blind ambush lay. <br />
Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, <br />
Beheld th&#8217; approaching war with hateful eyes, <br />
And call&#8217;d the light-foot Opis to her aid, <br />
Her most belov&#8217;d and ever-trusty maid; <br />
Then with a sigh began: &#8220;Camilla goes <br />
To meet her death amidst her fatal foes: <br />
The nymphs I lov&#8217;d of all my mortal train, <br />
Invested with Diana&#8217;s arms, in vain. <br />
Nor is my kindness for the virgin new: <br />
&#8216;T was born with her; and with her years it grew. <br />
Her father Metabus, when forc&#8217;d away <br />
From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway, <br />
Snatch&#8217;d up, and sav&#8217;d from his prevailing foes, <br />
This tender babe, companion of his woes. <br />
Casmilla was her mother; but he drown&#8217;d <br />
One hissing letter in a softer sound, <br />
And call&#8217;d Camilla. Thro&#8217; the woods he flies; <br />
Wrapp&#8217;d in his robe the royal infant lies. <br />
His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; <br />
With shouts and clamors they pursue the chase. <br />
The banks of Amasene at length he gains: <br />
The raging flood his farther flight restrains, <br />
Rais&#8217;d o&#8217;er the borders with unusual rains. <br />
Prepar&#8217;d to plunge into the stream, he fears, <br />
Not for himself, but for the charge he bears. <br />
Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste; <br />
Then, desp&#8217;rate in distress, resolves at last. <br />
A knotty lance of well-boil&#8217;d oak he bore; <br />
The middle part with cork he cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er: <br />
He clos&#8217;d the child within the hollow space; <br />
With twigs of bending osier bound the case; <br />
Then pois&#8217;d the spear, heavy with human weight, <br />
And thus invok&#8217;d my favor for the freight: <br />
&#8216;Accept, great goddess of the woods,&#8217; he said, <br />
&#8216;Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid! <br />
Thro&#8217; air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; <br />
And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.&#8217; <br />
He said; and with full force the spear he threw: <br />
Above the sounding waves Camilla flew. <br />
Then, press&#8217;d by foes, he stemm&#8217;d the stormy tide, <br />
And gain&#8217;d, by stress of arms, the farther side. <br />
His fasten&#8217;d spear he pull&#8217;d from out the ground, <br />
And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound; <br />
Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose, <br />
Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes; <br />
But, rough, in open air he chose to lie; <br />
Earth was his couch, his cov&#8217;ring was the sky. <br />
On hills unshorn, or in a desart den, <br />
He shunn&#8217;d the dire society of men. <br />
A shepherd&#8217;s solitary life he led; <br />
His daughter with the milk of mares he fed. <br />
The dugs of bears, and ev&#8217;ry salvage beast, <br />
He drew, and thro&#8217; her lips the liquor press&#8217;d. <br />
The little Amazon could scarcely go: <br />
He loads her with a quiver and a bow; <br />
And, that she might her stagg&#8217;ring steps command, <br />
He with a slender jav&#8217;lin fills her hand. <br />
Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; <br />
Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground. <br />
Instead of these, a tiger&#8217;s hide o&#8217;erspread <br />
Her back and shoulders, fasten&#8217;d to her head. <br />
The flying dart she first attempts to fling, <br />
And round her tender temples toss&#8217;d the sling; <br />
Then, as her strength with years increas&#8217;d, began <br />
To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, <br />
And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. <br />
The Tuscan matrons with each other vied, <br />
To bless their rival sons with such a bride; <br />
But she disdains their love, to share with me <br />
The sylvan shades and vow&#8217;d virginity. <br />
And, O! I wish, contented with my cares <br />
Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! <br />
Then had she been of my celestial train, <br />
And shunn&#8217;d the fate that dooms her to be slain. <br />
But since, opposing Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s decree, she goes <br />
To find her death among forbidden foes, <br />
Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight, <br />
Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. <br />
This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath, <br />
This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: <br />
By whate&#8217;er hand Camilla shall be slain, <br />
Or of the Trojan or Italian train, <br />
Let him not pass unpunish&#8217;d from the plain. <br />
Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid <br />
To bear the breathless body of my maid: <br />
Unspoil&#8217;d shall be her arms, and unprofan&#8217;d <br />
Her holy limbs with any human hand, <br />
And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.&#8221; <br />
She said. The faithful nymph descends from high <br />
With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: <br />
Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. <br />
By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, <br />
Drawn up in squadrons, with united force, <br />
Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, <br />
Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. <br />
Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; <br />
And the fields glitter with a waving war. <br />
Oppos&#8217;d to these, come on with furious force <br />
Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; <br />
These in the body plac&#8217;d, on either hand <br />
Sustain&#8217;d and clos&#8217;d by fair Camilla&#8217;s band. <br />
Advancing in a line, they couch their spears; <br />
And less and less the middle space appears. <br />
Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen <br />
The neighing coursers, and the shouting men. <br />
In distance of their darts they stop their course; <br />
Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse. <br />
The face of heav&#8217;n their flying jav&#8217;lins hide, <br />
And deaths unseen are dealt on either side. <br />
Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear, <br />
By mettled coursers borne in full career, <br />
Meet first oppos&#8217;d; and, with a mighty shock, <br />
Their horses&#8217; heads against each other knock. <br />
Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast, <br />
As with an engine&#8217;s force, or lightning&#8217;s blast: <br />
He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last. <br />
The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright, <br />
And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight. <br />
Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew; <br />
Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue, <br />
And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase; <br />
Till, seiz&#8217;d, with shame, they wheel about and face, <br />
Receive their foes, and raise a threat&#8217;ning cry. <br />
The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly. <br />
So swelling surges, with a thund&#8217;ring roar, <br />
Driv&#8217;n on each other&#8217;s backs, insult the shore, <br />
Bound o&#8217;er the rocks, incroach upon the land, <br />
And far upon the beach eject the sand; <br />
Then backward, with a swing, they take their way, <br />
Repuls&#8217;d from upper ground, and seek their mother sea; <br />
With equal hurry quit th&#8217; invaded shore, <br />
And swallow back the sand and stones they spew&#8217;d before. <br />
Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field, <br />
Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell&#8217;d. <br />
Asham&#8217;d at length, to the third charge they ran; <br />
Both hosts resolv&#8217;d, and mingled man to man. <br />
Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow&#8217;d <br />
With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood. <br />
Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie: <br />
Confus&#8217;d the fight, and more confus&#8217;d the cry. <br />
Orsilochus, who durst not press too near <br />
Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear, <br />
And stuck the steel beneath his horse&#8217;s ear. <br />
The fiery steed, impatient of the wound, <br />
Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound, <br />
His helpless lord cast backward on the ground. <br />
Catillus pierc&#8217;d Iolas first; then drew <br />
His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw, <br />
The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew. <br />
His neck and throat unarm&#8217;d, his head was bare, <br />
But shaded with a length of yellow hair: <br />
Secure, he fought, expos&#8217;d on ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart. <br />
Across the shoulders came the feather&#8217;d wound; <br />
Transfix&#8217;d he fell, and doubled to the ground. <br />
The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed, <br />
And death with honor sought on either side. <br />
Resistless thro&#8217; the war Camilla rode, <br />
In danger unappall&#8217;d, and pleas&#8217;d with blood. <br />
One side was bare for her exerted breast; <br />
One shoulder with her painted quiver press&#8217;d. <br />
Now from afar her fatal jav&#8217;lins play; <br />
Now with her ax&#8217;s edge she hews her way: <br />
Diana&#8217;s arms upon her shoulder sound; <br />
And when, too closely press&#8217;d, she quits the ground, <br />
From her bent bow she sends a backward wound. <br />
Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side, <br />
Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride: <br />
Italians all; in peace, their queen&#8217;s delight; <br />
In war, the bold companions of the fight. <br />
So march&#8217;d the Tracian Amazons of old, <br />
When Thermodon with bloody billows roll&#8217;d: <br />
Such troops as these in shining arms were seen, <br />
When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen: <br />
Such to the field Penthisilea led, <br />
From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled; <br />
With such, return&#8217;d triumphant from the war, <br />
Her maids with cries attend the lofty car; <br />
They clash with manly force their moony shields; <br />
With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields. <br />
Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid, <br />
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid? <br />
Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first, <br />
With fury driv&#8217;n, from side to side transpierc&#8217;d: <br />
A purple stream came spouting from the wound; <br />
Bath&#8217;d in his blood he lies, and bites the ground. <br />
Liris and Pagasus at once she slew: <br />
The former, as the slacken&#8217;d reins he drew <br />
Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch&#8217;d <br />
His arm to prop his friend, the jav&#8217;lin reach&#8217;d. <br />
By the same weapon, sent from the same hand, <br />
Both fall together, and both spurn the sand. <br />
Amastrus next is added to the slain: <br />
The rest in rout she follows o&#8217;er the plain: <br />
Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon, <br />
And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun. <br />
Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost; <br />
Each was attended with a Trojan ghost. <br />
Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed, <br />
Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed. <br />
Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown: <br />
O&#8217;er his broad back an ox&#8217;s hide was thrown; <br />
His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread <br />
A cov&#8217;ring for his cheeks, and grinn&#8217;d around his head, <br />
He clench&#8217;d within his hand an iron prong, <br />
And tower&#8217;d above the rest, conspicuous in the throng. <br />
Him soon she singled from the flying train, <br />
And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain: <br />
&#8220;Vain hunter, didst thou think thro&#8217; woods to chase <br />
The savage herd, a vile and trembling race? <br />
Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory: <br />
A woman warrior was too strong for thee. <br />
Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu&#8217;ror&#8217;s name. <br />
Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.&#8221; <br />
Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew, <br />
The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew; <br />
But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends <br />
Above the gorget, where his helmet ends, <br />
And o&#8217;er the shield which his left side defends. <br />
Orsilochus and she their courses ply: <br />
He seems to follow, and she seems to fly; <br />
But in a narrower ring she makes the race; <br />
And then he flies, and she pursues the chase. <br />
Gath&#8217;ring at length on her deluded foe, <br />
She swings her ax, and rises to the blow; <br />
Full on the helm behind, with such a sway <br />
The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: <br />
He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; <br />
Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face. <br />
Astonish&#8217;d Aunus just arrives by chance, <br />
To see his fall; nor farther dares advance; <br />
But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, <br />
He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; <br />
Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat, <br />
(At least while fortune favor&#8217;d his deceit,) <br />
Cries out aloud: &#8220;What courage have you shown, <br />
Who trust your courser&#8217;s strength, and not your own? <br />
Forego the vantage of your horse, alight, <br />
And then on equal terms begin the fight: <br />
It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, <br />
When, foot to foot, you combat with a man.&#8221; <br />
He said. She glows with anger and disdain, <br />
Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, <br />
And leaves her horse at large among her train; <br />
With her drawn sword defies him to the field, <br />
And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield. <br />
The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed, <br />
Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed; <br />
Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides <br />
The goring rowels in his bleeding sides. <br />
&#8220;Vain fool, and coward!&#8221; cries the lofty maid, <br />
&#8220;Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid! <br />
On others practice thy Ligurian arts; <br />
Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts <br />
Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, <br />
With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.&#8221; <br />
At this, so fast her flying feet she sped, <br />
That soon she strain&#8217;d beyond his horse&#8217;s head: <br />
Then turning short, at once she seiz&#8217;d the rein, <br />
And laid the boaster grov&#8217;ling on the plain. <br />
Not with more ease the falcon, from above, <br />
Trusses in middle air the trembling dove, <br />
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: <br />
The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground. <br />
Now mighty Jove, from his superior height, <br />
With his broad eye surveys th&#8217; unequal fight. <br />
He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain, <br />
And sends him to redeem th&#8217; abandon&#8217;d plain. <br />
Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides, <br />
And these encourages, and those he chides; <br />
Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight; <br />
Renews their ardor, and restores the fight. <br />
&#8220;What panic fear has seiz&#8217;d your souls? O shame, <br />
O brand perpetual of th&#8217; Etrurian name! <br />
Cowards incurable, a woman&#8217;s hand <br />
Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! <br />
Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield! <br />
What use of weapons which you dare not wield? <br />
Not thus you fly your female foes by night, <br />
Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; <br />
When to fat off&#8217;rings the glad augur calls, <br />
And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals. <br />
These are your studied cares, your lewd delight: <br />
Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes, <br />
Not managing the life he meant to lose. <br />
The first he found he seiz&#8217;d with headlong haste, <br />
In his strong gripe, and clasp&#8217;d around the waist; <br />
&#8216;T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore, <br />
And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore. <br />
Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes, <br />
And view th&#8217; unusual sight with vast surprise. <br />
The fiery Tarchon, flying o&#8217;er the plains, <br />
Press&#8217;d in his arms the pond&#8217;rous prey sustains; <br />
Then, with his shorten&#8217;d spear, explores around <br />
His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. <br />
Nor less the captive struggles for his life: <br />
He writhes his body to prolong the strife, <br />
And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts <br />
His utmost vigor, and the point averts. <br />
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high, <br />
And bears a speckled serpent thro&#8217; the sky, <br />
Fast&#8217;ning his crooked talons on the prey: <br />
The pris&#8217;ner hisses thro&#8217; the liquid way; <br />
Resists the royal hawk; and, tho&#8217; oppress&#8217;d, <br />
She fights in volumes, and erects her crest: <br />
Turn&#8217;d to her foe, she stiffens ev&#8217;ry scale, <br />
And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat&#8217;ning tail. <br />
Against the victor, all defense is weak: <br />
Th&#8217; imperial bird still plies her with his beak; <br />
He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores; <br />
Then claps his pinions, and securely soars. <br />
Thus, thro&#8217; the midst of circling enemies, <br />
Strong Tarchon snatch&#8217;d and bore away his prize. <br />
The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press <br />
The Latins, and presume the like success. <br />
Then Aruns, doom&#8217;d to death, his arts assay&#8217;d, <br />
To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid: <br />
This way and that his winding course he bends, <br />
And, whereso&#8217;er she turns, her steps attends. <br />
When she retires victorious from the chase, <br />
He wheels about with care, and shifts his place; <br />
When, rushing on, she seeks her foes in flight, <br />
He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: <br />
He threats, and trembles, trying ev&#8217;ry way, <br />
Unseen to kill, and safely to betray. <br />
Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far, <br />
Glitt&#8217;ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war, <br />
Was by the virgin view&#8217;d. The steed he press&#8217;d <br />
Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest <br />
With scales of gilded brass was cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er; <br />
A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore. <br />
With deadly wounds he gall&#8217;d the distant foe; <br />
Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow: <br />
A golden helm his front and head surrounds; <br />
A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. <br />
Gold, weav&#8217;d with linen, on his thighs he wore, <br />
With flowers of needlework distinguish&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
With golden buckles bound, and gather&#8217;d up before. <br />
Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes, <br />
Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize, <br />
Or that the temple might his trophies hold, <br />
Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold. <br />
Blind in her haste, she chases him alone. <br />
And seeks his life, regardless of her own. <br />
This lucky moment the sly traitor chose: <br />
Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose, <br />
And threw, but first to Heav&#8217;n address&#8217;d his vows: <br />
&#8220;O patron of Socrate&#8217;s high abodes, <br />
Phoebus, the ruling pow&#8217;r among the gods, <br />
Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine <br />
Are fell&#8217;d for thee, and to thy glory shine; <br />
By thee protected with our naked soles, <br />
Thro&#8217; flames unsing&#8217;d we march, and tread the kindled coals: <br />
Give me, propitious pow&#8217;r, to wash away <br />
The stains of this dishonorable day: <br />
Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, <br />
But with my future actions trust my fame. <br />
Let me, by stealth, this female plague o&#8217;ercome, <br />
And from the field return inglorious home.&#8221; <br />
Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray&#8217;r, <br />
Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss&#8217;d in empty air. <br />
He gives the death desir&#8217;d; his safe return <br />
By southern tempests to the seas is borne. <br />
Now, when the jav&#8217;lin whizz&#8217;d along the skies, <br />
Both armies on Camilla turn&#8217;d their eyes, <br />
Directed by the sound. Of either host, <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy virgin, tho&#8217; concern&#8217;d the most, <br />
Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent <br />
On golden spoils, and on her prey intent; <br />
Till in her pap the winged weapon stood <br />
Infix&#8217;d, and deeply drunk the purple blood. <br />
Her sad attendants hasten to sustain <br />
Their dying lady, drooping on the plain. <br />
Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies, <br />
With beating heart, and fear confus&#8217;d with joys; <br />
Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow, <br />
Or ev&#8217;n to bear the sight of his expiring foe. <br />
As, when the wolf has torn a bullock&#8217;s hide <br />
At unawares, or ranch&#8217;d a shepherd&#8217;s side, <br />
Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies, <br />
And claps his quiv&#8217;ring tail between his thighs: <br />
So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends, <br />
But, spurring forward, herds among his friends. <br />
She wrench&#8217;d the jav&#8217;lin with her dying hands, <br />
But wedg&#8217;d within her breast the weapon stands; <br />
The wood she draws, the steely point remains; <br />
She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains: <br />
(A gath&#8217;ring mist o&#8217;erclouds her cheerful eyes, <br />
And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:) <br />
Then turns to her, whom of her female train <br />
She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain: <br />
&#8220;Acca, &#8216;t is past! he swims before my sight, <br />
Inexorable Death; and claims his right. <br />
Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed, <br />
And bid him timely to my charge succeed, <br />
Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve: <br />
Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive.&#8221; <br />
She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: <br />
Dying, her open&#8217;d hand forsakes the rein; <br />
Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees <br />
Her mind the passage from her body frees. <br />
She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest, <br />
Her drooping head declining on her breast: <br />
In the last sigh her struggling soul expires, <br />
And, murm&#8217;ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires. <br />
A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; <br />
Despair and rage the languish&#8217;d fight renew&#8217;d. <br />
The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line, <br />
Advance to charge; the mix&#8217;d Arcadians join. <br />
But Cynthia&#8217;s maid, high seated, from afar <br />
Surveys the field, and fortune of the war, <br />
Unmov&#8217;d a while, till, prostrate on the plain, <br />
Welt&#8217;ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain, <br />
And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train. <br />
Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew <br />
A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue: <br />
&#8220;Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid, <br />
For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid! <br />
Nor aught avail&#8217;d, in this unhappy strife, <br />
Diana&#8217;s sacred arms, to save thy life. <br />
Yet unreveng&#8217;d thy goddess will not leave <br />
Her vot&#8217;ry&#8217;s death, nor with vain sorrow grieve. <br />
Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr&#8217;d; <br />
But after ages shall thy praise record. <br />
Th&#8217; inglorious coward soon shall press the plain: <br />
Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain.&#8221; <br />
High o&#8217;er the field there stood a hilly mound, <br />
Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around, <br />
Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay, <br />
A king that once in Latium bore the sway. <br />
The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight, <br />
To mark the traitor Aruns from the height. <br />
Him in refulgent arms she soon espied, <br />
Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried: <br />
&#8220;Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late; <br />
Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate. <br />
Charg&#8217;d with my message, to Camilla go, <br />
And say I sent thee to the shades below, <br />
An honor undeserv&#8217;d from Cynthia&#8217;s bow.&#8221; <br />
She said, and from her quiver chose with speed <br />
The winged shaft, predestin&#8217;d for the deed; <br />
Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied, <br />
Till the far distant horns approach&#8217;d on either side. <br />
The bowstring touch&#8217;d her breast, so strong she drew; <br />
Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. <br />
At once the twanging bow and sounding dart <br />
The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart. <br />
Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death, <br />
His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. <br />
The conqu&#8217;ring damsel, with expanded wings, <br />
The welcome message to her mistress brings. <br />
Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field, <br />
And, unsustain&#8217;d, the chiefs of Turnus yield. <br />
The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, <br />
More on their speed than on their strength rely. <br />
Confus&#8217;d in flight, they bear each other down, <br />
And spur their horses headlong to the town. <br />
Driv&#8217;n by their foes, and to their fears resign&#8217;d, <br />
Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind. <br />
These drop the shield, and those the lance forego, <br />
Or on their shoulders bear the slacken&#8217;d bow. <br />
The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, <br />
Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. <br />
Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky, <br />
And o&#8217;er the darken&#8217;d walls and rampires fly. <br />
The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, <br />
Rend heav&#8217;n with female shrieks, and wring their hands. <br />
All pressing on, pursuers and pursued, <br />
Are crush&#8217;d in crowds, a mingled multitude. <br />
Some happy few escape: the throng too late <br />
Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. <br />
Ev&#8217;n in the sight of home, the wretched sire <br />
Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire. <br />
Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close, <br />
But leave their friends excluded with their foes. <br />
The vanquish&#8217;d cry; the victors loudly shout; <br />
&#8216;T is terror all within, and slaughter all without. <br />
Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, <br />
Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. <br />
The Latian virgins, valiant with despair, <br />
Arm&#8217;d on the tow&#8217;rs, the common danger share: <br />
So much of zeal their country&#8217;s cause inspir&#8217;d; <br />
So much Camilla&#8217;s great example fir&#8217;d. <br />
Poles, sharpen&#8217;d in the flames, from high they throw, <br />
With imitated darts, to gall the foe. <br />
Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath, <br />
And crowd each other to be first in death. <br />
Meantime to Turnus, ambush&#8217;d in the shade, <br />
With heavy tidings came th&#8217; unhappy maid: <br />
&#8220;The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill&#8217;d; <br />
The foes, entirely masters of the field, <br />
Like a resistless flood, come rolling on: <br />
The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.&#8221; <br />
Inflam&#8217;d with rage, (for so the Furies fire <br />
The Daunian&#8217;s breast, and so the Fates require,) <br />
He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain <br />
Possess&#8217;d, and downward issues on the plain. <br />
Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed <br />
From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. <br />
Thro&#8217; the black forest and the ferny brake, <br />
Unknowingly secure, their way they take; <br />
From the rough mountains to the plain descend, <br />
And there, in order drawn, their line extend. <br />
Both armies now in open fields are seen; <br />
Nor far the distance of the space between. <br />
Both to the city bend. AEneas sees, <br />
Thro&#8217; smoking fields, his hast&#8217;ning enemies; <br />
And Turnus views the Trojans in array, <br />
And hears th&#8217; approaching horses proudly neigh. <br />
Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join&#8217;d; <br />
But westward to the sea the sun declin&#8217;d. <br />
Intrench&#8217;d before the town both armies lie, <br />
While Night with sable wings involves the sky.</p>
