				<p>THE SECOND BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; AEneas relates how the city of Troy was taken,<br />
after a ten years&#8217; siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the strata-<br />
gem of a wooden horse. He declares the fix&#8217;d resolution he had<br />
taken not to survive the ruins of his country, and the various adven-<br />
tures he met with in the defense of it. At last, having been before<br />
advis&#8217;d by Hector&#8217;s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother<br />
Venus, he is prevail&#8217;d upon to leave the town, and settle his house-<br />
hold gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his<br />
father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his<br />
wife following them behind. When he comes to the place appointed<br />
for the general rendezvouze, he finds a great confluence of people,<br />
but misses his wife whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells<br />
him the land which was design&#8217;d for him.</p>
<p>ALL were attentive to the godlike man, <br />
When from his lofty couch he thus began: <br />
&#8220;Great queen, what you command me to relate <br />
Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: <br />
An empire from its old foundations rent, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry woe the Trojans underwent; <br />
A peopled city made a desart place; <br />
All that I saw, and part of which I was: <br />
Not ev&#8217;n the hardest of our foes could hear, <br />
Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. <br />
And now the latter watch of wasting night, <br />
And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; <br />
But, since you take such int&#8217;rest in our woe, <br />
And Troy&#8217;s disastrous end desire to know, <br />
I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell <br />
What in our last and fatal night befell. <br />
&#8220;By destiny compell&#8217;d, and in despair, <br />
The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war, <br />
And by Minerva&#8217;s aid a fabric rear&#8217;d, <br />
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear&#8217;d: <br />
The sides were plank&#8217;d with pine; they feign&#8217;d it made <br />
For their return, and this the vow they paid. <br />
Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side <br />
Selected numbers of their soldiers hide: <br />
With inward arms the dire machine they load, <br />
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode. <br />
In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle <br />
(While Fortune did on Priam&#8217;s empire smile) <br />
Renown&#8217;d for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay, <br />
Where ships expos&#8217;d to wind and weather lay. <br />
There was their fleet conceal&#8217;d. We thought, for Greece <br />
Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release. <br />
The Trojans, coop&#8217;d within their walls so long, <br />
Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng, <br />
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey <br />
The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay: <br />
The quarters of the sev&#8217;ral chiefs they show&#8217;d; <br />
Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode; <br />
Here join&#8217;d the battles; there the navy rode. <br />
Part on the pile their wond&#8217;ring eyes employ: <br />
The pile by Pallas rais&#8217;d to ruin Troy. <br />
Thymoetes first (&#8216;t is doubtful whether hir&#8217;d, <br />
Or so the Trojan destiny requir&#8217;d) <br />
Mov&#8217;d that the ramparts might be broken down, <br />
To lodge the monster fabric in the town. <br />
But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind, <br />
The fatal present to the flames designed, <br />
Or to the wat&#8217;ry deep; at least to bore <br />
The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. <br />
The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, <br />
With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. <br />
Laocoon, follow&#8217;d by a num&#8217;rous crowd, <br />
Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: <br />
&#8216;O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? <br />
What more than madness has possess&#8217;d your brains? <br />
Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? <br />
And are Ulysses&#8217; arts no better known? <br />
This hollow fabric either must inclose, <br />
Within its blind recess, our secret foes; <br />
Or &#8216;t is an engine rais&#8217;d above the town, <br />
T&#8217; o&#8217;erlook the walls, and then to batter down. <br />
Somewhat is sure design&#8217;d, by fraud or force: <br />
Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.&#8217; <br />
Thus having said, against the steed he threw <br />
His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew, <br />
Pierc&#8217;d thro&#8217; the yielding planks of jointed wood, <br />
And trembling in the hollow belly stood. <br />
The sides, transpierc&#8217;d, return a rattling sound, <br />
And groans of Greeks inclos&#8217;d come issuing thro&#8217; the wound. <br />
And, had not Heav&#8217;n the fall of Troy design&#8217;d, <br />
Or had not men been fated to be blind, <br />
Enough was said and done t&#8217; inspire a better mind. <br />
Then had our lances pierc&#8217;d the treach&#8217;rous wood, <br />
And Ilian tow&#8217;rs and Priam&#8217;s empire stood. <br />
Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring <br />
A captive Greek, in bands, before the king; <br />
Taken to take; who made himself their prey, <br />
T&#8217; impose on their belief, and Troy betray; <br />
Fix&#8217;d on his aim, and obstinately bent <br />
To die undaunted, or to circumvent. <br />
About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; <br />
All press to see, and some insult the foe. <br />
Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis&#8217;d; <br />
Behold a nation in a man compris&#8217;d. <br />
Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm&#8217;d and bound; <br />
He star&#8217;d, and roll&#8217;d his haggard eyes around, <br />
Then said: &#8216;Alas! what earth remains, what sea <br />
Is open to receive unhappy me? <br />
What fate a wretched fugitive attends, <br />
Scorn&#8217;d by my foes, abandon&#8217;d by my friends?&#8217; <br />
He said, and sigh&#8217;d, and cast a rueful eye: <br />
Our pity kindles, and our passions die. <br />
We cheer the youth to make his own defense, <br />
And freely tell us what he was, and whence: <br />
What news he could impart, we long to know, <br />
And what to credit from a captive foe. <br />
&#8220;His fear at length dismiss&#8217;d, he said: &#8216;Whate&#8217;er <br />
My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere: <br />
I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim; <br />
Greece is my country, Sinon is my name. <br />
Tho&#8217; plung&#8217;d by Fortune&#8217;s pow&#8217;r in misery, <br />
&#8216;T is not in Fortune&#8217;s pow&#8217;r to make me lie. <br />
If any chance has hither brought the name <br />
Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame, <br />
Who suffer&#8217;d from the malice of the times, <br />
Accus&#8217;d and sentenc&#8217;d for pretended crimes, <br />
Because these fatal wars he would prevent; <br />
Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament&#8211; <br />
Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare <br />
Of other means, committed to his care, <br />
His kinsman and companion in the war. <br />
While Fortune favor&#8217;d, while his arms support <br />
The cause, and rul&#8217;d the counsels, of the court, <br />
I made some figure there; nor was my name <br />
Obscure, nor I without my share of fame. <br />
But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts, <br />
Had made impression in the people&#8217;s hearts, <br />
And forg&#8217;d a treason in my patron&#8217;s name <br />
(I speak of things too far divulg&#8217;d by fame), <br />
My kinsman fell. Then I, without support, <br />
In private mourn&#8217;d his loss, and left the court. <br />
Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate <br />
With silent grief, but loudly blam&#8217;d the state, <br />
And curs&#8217;d the direful author of my woes. <br />
&#8216;T was told again; and hence my ruin rose. <br />
I threaten&#8217;d, if indulgent Heav&#8217;n once more <br />
Would land me safely on my native shore, <br />
His death with double vengeance to restore. <br />
This mov&#8217;d the murderer&#8217;s hate; and soon ensued <br />
Th&#8217; effects of malice from a man so proud. <br />
Ambiguous rumors thro&#8217; the camp he spread, <br />
And sought, by treason, my devoted head; <br />
New crimes invented; left unturn&#8217;d no stone, <br />
To make my guilt appear, and hide his own; <br />
Till Calchas was by force and threat&#8217;ning wrought&#8211; <br />
But why&#8211;why dwell I on that anxious thought? <br />
If on my nation just revenge you seek, <br />
And &#8216;t is t&#8217; appear a foe, t&#8217; appear a Greek; <br />
Already you my name and country know; <br />
Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow: <br />
My death will both the kingly brothers please, <br />
And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.&#8217; <br />
This fair unfinish&#8217;d tale, these broken starts, <br />
Rais&#8217;d expectations in our longing hearts: <br />
Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts. <br />
His former trembling once again renew&#8217;d, <br />
With acted fear, the villain thus pursued: <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Long had the Grecians (tir&#8217;d with fruitless care, <br />
And wearied with an unsuccessful war) <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to raise the siege, and leave the town; <br />
And, had the gods permitted, they had gone; <br />
But oft the wintry seas and southern winds <br />
Withstood their passage home, and chang&#8217;d their minds. <br />
Portents and prodigies their souls amaz&#8217;d; <br />
But most, when this stupendous pile was rais&#8217;d: <br />
Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, <br />
And thunders rattled thro&#8217; a sky serene. <br />
Dismay&#8217;d, and fearful of some dire event, <br />
Eurypylus t&#8217; enquire their fate was sent. <br />
He from the gods this dreadful answer brought: <br />
&#8220;O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, <br />
Your passage with a virgin&#8217;s blood was bought: <br />
So must your safe return be bought again, <br />
And Grecian blood once more atone the main.&#8221; <br />
The spreading rumor round the people ran; <br />
All fear&#8217;d, and each believ&#8217;d himself the man. <br />
Ulysses took th&#8217; advantage of their fright; <br />
Call&#8217;d Calchas, and produc&#8217;d in open sight: <br />
Then bade him name the wretch, ordain&#8217;d by fate <br />
The public victim, to redeem the state. <br />
Already some presag&#8217;d the dire event, <br />
And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. <br />
For twice five days the good old seer withstood <br />
Th&#8217; intended treason, and was dumb to blood, <br />
Till, tir&#8217;d, with endless clamors and pursuit <br />
Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; <br />
But, as it was agreed, pronounc&#8217;d that I <br />
Was destin&#8217;d by the wrathful gods to die. <br />
All prais&#8217;d the sentence, pleas&#8217;d the storm should fall <br />
On one alone, whose fury threaten&#8217;d all. <br />
The dismal day was come; the priests prepare <br />
Their leaven&#8217;d cakes, and fillets for my hair. <br />
I follow&#8217;d nature&#8217;s laws, and must avow <br />
I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. <br />
Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay, <br />
Secure of safety when they sail&#8217;d away. <br />
But now what further hopes for me remain, <br />
To see my friends, or native soil, again; <br />
My tender infants, or my careful sire, <br />
Whom they returning will to death require; <br />
Will perpetrate on them their first design, <br />
And take the forfeit of their heads for mine? <br />
Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move, <br />
If there be faith below, or gods above, <br />
If innocence and truth can claim desert, <br />
Ye Trojans, from an injur&#8217;d wretch avert.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;False tears true pity move; the king commands <br />
To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands: <br />
Then adds these friendly words: &#8216;Dismiss thy fears; <br />
Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs. <br />
But truly tell, was it for force or guile, <br />
Or some religious end, you rais&#8217;d the pile?&#8217; <br />
Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts, <br />
This well-invented tale for truth imparts: <br />
&#8216;Ye lamps of heav&#8217;n!&#8217; he said, and lifted high <br />
His hands now free, &#8216;thou venerable sky! <br />
Inviolable pow&#8217;rs, ador&#8217;d with dread! <br />
Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head! <br />
Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! <br />
Be all of you adjur&#8217;d; and grant I may, <br />
Without a crime, th&#8217; ungrateful Greeks betray, <br />
Reveal the secrets of the guilty state, <br />
And justly punish whom I justly hate! <br />
But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave, <br />
If I, to save myself, your empire save. <br />
The Grecian hopes, and all th&#8217; attempts they made, <br />
Were only founded on Minerva&#8217;s aid. <br />
But from the time when impious Diomede, <br />
And false Ulysses, that inventive head, <br />
Her fatal image from the temple drew, <br />
The sleeping guardians of the castle slew, <br />
Her virgin statue with their bloody hands <br />
Polluted, and profan&#8217;d her holy bands; <br />
From thence the tide of fortune left their shore, <br />
And ebb&#8217;d much faster than it flow&#8217;d before: <br />
Their courage languish&#8217;d, as their hopes decay&#8217;d; <br />
And Pallas, now averse, refus&#8217;d her aid. <br />
Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare <br />
Her alter&#8217;d mind and alienated care. <br />
When first her fatal image touch&#8217;d the ground, <br />
She sternly cast her glaring eyes around, <br />
That sparkled as they roll&#8217;d, and seem&#8217;d to threat: <br />
Her heav&#8217;nly limbs distill&#8217;d a briny sweat. <br />
Thrice from the ground she leap&#8217;d, was seen to wield <br />
Her brandish&#8217;d lance, and shake her horrid shield. <br />
Then Calchas bade our host for flight prepare, <br />
And hope no conquest from the tedious war, <br />
Till first they sail&#8217;d for Greece; with pray&#8217;rs besought <br />
Her injur&#8217;d pow&#8217;r, and better omens brought. <br />
And now their navy plows the wat&#8217;ry main, <br />
Yet soon expect it on your shores again, <br />
With Pallas pleas&#8217;d; as Calchas did ordain. <br />
But first, to reconcile the blue-ey&#8217;d maid <br />
For her stol&#8217;n statue and her tow&#8217;r betray&#8217;d, <br />
Warn&#8217;d by the seer, to her offended name <br />
We rais&#8217;d and dedicate this wondrous frame, <br />
So lofty, lest thro&#8217; your forbidden gates <br />
It pass, and intercept our better fates: <br />
For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; <br />
And Troy may then a new Palladium boast; <br />
For so religion and the gods ordain, <br />
That, if you violate with hands profane <br />
Minerva&#8217;s gift, your town in flames shall burn, <br />
(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!) <br />
But if it climb, with your assisting hands, <br />
The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; <br />
Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, <br />
And the reverse of fate on us return.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;With such deceits he gain&#8217;d their easy hearts, <br />
Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. <br />
What Diomede, nor Thetis&#8217; greater son, <br />
A thousand ships, nor ten years&#8217; siege, had done&#8211; <br />
False tears and fawning words the city won. <br />
&#8220;A greater omen, and of worse portent, <br />
Did our unwary minds with fear torment, <br />
Concurring to produce the dire event. <br />
Laocoon, Neptune&#8217;s priest by lot that year, <br />
With solemn pomp then sacrific&#8217;d a steer; <br />
When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied <br />
Two serpents, rank&#8217;d abreast, the seas divide, <br />
And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. <br />
Their flaming crests above the waves they show; <br />
Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; <br />
Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, <br />
And on the sounding shore the flying billows force. <br />
And now the strand, and now the plain they held; <br />
Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill&#8217;d; <br />
Their nimble tongues they brandish&#8217;d as they came, <br />
And lick&#8217;d their hissing jaws, that sputter&#8217;d flame. <br />
We fled amaz&#8217;d; their destin&#8217;d way they take, <br />
And to Laocoon and his children make; <br />
And first around the tender boys they wind, <br />
Then with their sharpen&#8217;d fangs their limbs and bodies grind <br />
The wretched father, running to their aid <br />
With pious haste, but vain, they next invade; <br />
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll&#8217;d; <br />
And twice about his gasping throat they fold. <br />
The priest thus doubly chok&#8217;d, their crests divide, <br />
And tow&#8217;ring o&#8217;er his head in triumph ride. <br />
With both his hands he labors at the knots; <br />
His holy fillets the blue venom blots; <br />
His roaring fills the flitting air around. <br />
Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, <br />
He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, <br />
And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. <br />
Their tasks perform&#8217;d, the serpents quit their prey, <br />
And to the tow&#8217;r of Pallas make their way: <br />
Couch&#8217;d at her feet, they lie protected there <br />
By her large buckler and protended spear. <br />
Amazement seizes all; the gen&#8217;ral cry <br />
Proclaims Laocoon justly doom&#8217;d to die, <br />
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, <br />
And dared to violate the sacred wood. <br />
All vote t&#8217; admit the steed, that vows be paid <br />
And incense offer&#8217;d to th&#8217; offended maid. <br />
A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; <br />
Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare <br />
And fasten to the horse&#8217;s feet; the rest <br />
With cables haul along th&#8217; unwieldly beast. <br />
Each on his fellow for assistance calls; <br />
At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, <br />
Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown&#8217;d, <br />
And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. <br />
Thus rais&#8217;d aloft, and then descending down, <br />
It enters o&#8217;er our heads, and threats the town. <br />
O sacred city, built by hands divine! <br />
O valiant heroes of the Trojan line! <br />
Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound <br />
Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. <br />
Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate, <br />
We haul along the horse in solemn state; <br />
Then place the dire portent within the tow&#8217;r. <br />
Cassandra cried, and curs&#8217;d th&#8217; unhappy hour; <br />
Foretold our fate; but, by the god&#8217;s decree, <br />
All heard, and none believ&#8217;d the prophecy. <br />
With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, <br />
In jollity, the day ordain&#8217;d to be the last. <br />
Meantime the rapid heav&#8217;ns roll&#8217;d down the light, <br />
And on the shaded ocean rush&#8217;d the night; <br />
Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held, <br />
But easy sleep their weary limbs compell&#8217;d. <br />
The Grecians had embark&#8217;d their naval pow&#8217;rs <br />
From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, <br />
Safe under covert of the silent night, <br />
And guided by th&#8217; imperial galley&#8217;s light; <br />
When Sinon, favor&#8217;d by the partial gods, <br />
Unlock&#8217;d the horse, and op&#8217;d his dark abodes; <br />
Restor&#8217;d to vital air our hidden foes, <br />
Who joyful from their long confinement rose. <br />
Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide, <br />
And dire Ulysses down the cable slide: <br />
Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste; <br />
Nor was the Podalirian hero last, <br />
Nor injur&#8217;d Menelaus, nor the fam&#8217;d <br />
Epeus, who the fatal engine fram&#8217;d. <br />
A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join <br />
T&#8217; invade the town, oppress&#8217;d with sleep and wine. <br />
Those few they find awake first meet their fate; <br />
Then to their fellows they unbar the gate. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs <br />
Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares, <br />
When Hector&#8217;s ghost before my sight appears: <br />
A bloody shroud he seem&#8217;d, and bath&#8217;d in tears; <br />
Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain, <br />
Thessalian coursers dragg&#8217;d him o&#8217;er the plain. <br />
Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust <br />
Thro&#8217; the bor&#8217;d holes; his body black with dust; <br />
Unlike that Hector who return&#8217;d from toils <br />
Of war, triumphant, in AEacian spoils, <br />
Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire, <br />
And launch&#8217;d against their navy Phrygian fire. <br />
His hair and beard stood stiffen&#8217;d with his gore; <br />
And all the wounds he for his country bore <br />
Now stream&#8217;d afresh, and with new purple ran. <br />
I wept to see the visionary man, <br />
And, while my trance continued, thus began: <br />
&#8216;O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, <br />
Thy father&#8217;s champion, and thy country&#8217;s joy! <br />
O, long expected by thy friends! from whence <br />
Art thou so late return&#8217;d for our defense? <br />
Do we behold thee, wearied as we are <br />
With length of labors, and with toils of war? <br />
After so many fun&#8217;rals of thy own <br />
Art thou restor&#8217;d to thy declining town? <br />
But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace <br />
Deforms the manly features of thy face?&#8217; <br />
&#8220;To this the specter no reply did frame, <br />
But answer&#8217;d to the cause for which he came, <br />
And, groaning from the bottom of his breast, <br />
This warning in these mournful words express&#8217;d: <br />
&#8216;O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, <br />
The flames and horrors of this fatal night. <br />
The foes already have possess&#8217;d the wall; <br />
Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. <br />
Enough is paid to Priam&#8217;s royal name, <br />
More than enough to duty and to fame. <br />
If by a mortal hand my father&#8217;s throne <br />
Could be defended, &#8216;t was by mine alone. <br />
Now Troy to thee commends her future state, <br />
And gives her gods companions of thy fate: <br />
From their assistance happier walls expect, <br />
Which, wand&#8217;ring long, at last thou shalt erect.&#8217; <br />
He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, <br />
The venerable statues of the gods, <br />
With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, <br />
The wreaths and relics of th&#8217; immortal fire. <br />
&#8220;Now peals of shouts come thund&#8217;ring from afar, <br />
Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: <br />
The noise approaches, tho&#8217; our palace stood <br />
Aloof from streets, encompass&#8217;d with a wood. <br />
Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th&#8217; alarms <br />
Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. <br />
Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, <br />
But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, <br />
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. <br />
Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne, <br />
Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; <br />
Or deluges, descending on the plains, <br />
Sweep o&#8217;er the yellow year, destroy the pains <br />
Of lab&#8217;ring oxen and the peasant&#8217;s gains; <br />
Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away <br />
Flocks, folds, and trees, an undistinguish&#8217;d prey: <br />
The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far <br />
The wasteful ravage of the wat&#8217;ry war. <br />
Then Hector&#8217;s faith was manifestly clear&#8217;d, <br />
And Grecian frauds in open light appear&#8217;d. <br />
The palace of Deiphobus ascends <br />
In smoky flames, and catches on his friends. <br />
Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright <br />
With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light. <br />
New clamors and new clangors now arise, <br />
The sound of trumpets mix&#8217;d with fighting cries. <br />
With frenzy seiz&#8217;d, I run to meet th&#8217; alarms, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d on death, resolv&#8217;d to die in arms, <br />
But first to gather friends, with them t&#8217; oppose <br />
(If fortune favor&#8217;d) and repel the foes; <br />
Spurr&#8217;d by my courage, by my country fir&#8217;d, <br />
With sense of honor and revenge inspir&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;Pantheus, Apollo&#8217;s priest, a sacred name, <br />
Had scap&#8217;d the Grecian swords, and pass&#8217;d the flame: <br />
With relics loaden, to my doors he fled, <br />
And by the hand his tender grandson led. <br />
&#8216;What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run? <br />
Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?&#8217; <br />
Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan: <br />
&#8216;Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town! <br />
The fatal day, th&#8217; appointed hour, is come, <br />
When wrathful Jove&#8217;s irrevocable doom <br />
Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. <br />
The fire consumes the town, the foe commands; <br />
And armed hosts, an unexpected force, <br />
Break from the bowels of the fatal horse. <br />
Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about <br />
The flames; and foes for entrance press without, <br />
With thousand others, whom I fear to name, <br />
More than from Argos or Mycenae came. <br />
To sev&#8217;ral posts their parties they divide; <br />
Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: <br />
The bold they kill, th&#8217; unwary they surprise; <br />
Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies. <br />
The warders of the gate but scarce maintain <br />
Th&#8217; unequal combat, and resist in vain.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;I heard; and Heav&#8217;n, that well-born souls inspires, <br />
Prompts me thro&#8217; lifted swords and rising fires <br />
To run where clashing arms and clamor calls, <br />
And rush undaunted to defend the walls. <br />
Ripheus and Iph&#8217;itus by my side engage, <br />
For valor one renown&#8217;d, and one for age. <br />
Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew <br />
My motions and my mien, and to my party drew; <br />
With young Coroebus, who by love was led <br />
To win renown and fair Cassandra&#8217;s bed, <br />
And lately brought his troops to Priam&#8217;s aid, <br />
Forewarn&#8217;d in vain by the prophetic maid. <br />
Whom when I saw resolv&#8217;d in arms to fall, <br />
And that one spirit animated all: <br />
&#8216;Brave souls!&#8217; said I,&#8211;&#8217;but brave, alas! in vain&#8211; <br />
Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain. <br />
You see the desp&#8217;rate state of our affairs, <br />
And heav&#8217;n&#8217;s protecting pow&#8217;rs are deaf to pray&#8217;rs. <br />
The passive gods behold the Greeks defile <br />
Their temples, and abandon to the spoil <br />
Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire <br />
To save a sinking town, involv&#8217;d in fire. <br />
Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: <br />
Despair of life the means of living shows.&#8217; <br />
So bold a speech incourag&#8217;d their desire <br />
Of death, and added fuel to their fire. <br />
&#8220;As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, <br />
Scour thro&#8217; the fields, nor fear the stormy night&#8211; <br />
Their whelps at home expect the promis&#8217;d food, <br />
And long to temper their dry chaps in blood&#8211; <br />
So rush&#8217;d we forth at once; resolv&#8217;d to die, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d, in death, the last extremes to try. <br />
We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare <br />
Th&#8217; unequal combat in the public square: <br />
Night was our friend; our leader was despair. <br />
What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? <br />
What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? <br />
An ancient and imperial city falls: <br />
The streets are fill&#8217;d with frequent funerals; <br />
Houses and holy temples float in blood, <br />
And hostile nations make a common flood. <br />
Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn, <br />
The vanquish&#8217;d triumph, and the victors mourn. <br />
Ours take new courage from despair and night: <br />
Confus&#8217;d the fortune is, confus&#8217;d the fight. <br />
All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; <br />
And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. <br />
Androgeos fell among us, with his band, <br />
Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. <br />
&#8216;From whence,&#8217; said he, &#8216;my friends, this long delay? <br />
You loiter, while the spoils are borne away: <br />
Our ships are laden with the Trojan store; <br />
And you, like truants, come too late ashore.&#8217; <br />
He said, but soon corrected his mistake, <br />
Found, by the doubtful answers which we make: <br />
Amaz&#8217;d, he would have shunn&#8217;d th&#8217; unequal fight; <br />
But we, more num&#8217;rous, intercept his flight. <br />
As when some peasant, in a bushy brake, <br />
Has with unwary footing press&#8217;d a snake; <br />
He starts aside, astonish&#8217;d, when he spies <br />
His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; <br />
So from our arms surpris&#8217;d Androgeos flies. <br />
In vain; for him and his we compass&#8217;d round, <br />
Possess&#8217;d with fear, unknowing of the ground, <br />
And of their lives an easy conquest found. <br />
Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil&#8217;d. <br />
Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil&#8217;d, <br />
Swoln with success, and of a daring mind, <br />
This new invention fatally design&#8217;d. <br />
&#8216;My friends,&#8217; said he, &#8216;since Fortune shows the way, <br />
&#8216;T is fit we should th&#8217; auspicious guide obey. <br />
For what has she these Grecian arms bestow&#8217;d, <br />
But their destruction, and the Trojans&#8217; good? <br />
Then change we shields, and their devices bear: <br />
Let fraud supply the want of force in war. <br />
They find us arms.&#8217; This said, himself he dress&#8217;d <br />
In dead Androgeos&#8217; spoils, his upper vest, <br />
His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. <br />
Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train, <br />
Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain. <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the Greeks, we go with ill presage, <br />
Flatter&#8217;d with hopes to glut our greedy rage; <br />
Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, <br />
And strew with Grecian carcasses the street. <br />
Thus while their straggling parties we defeat, <br />
Some to the shore and safer ships retreat; <br />
And some, oppress&#8217;d with more ignoble fear, <br />
Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. <br />
&#8220;But, ah! what use of valor can be made, <br />
When heav&#8217;n&#8217;s propitious pow&#8217;rs refuse their aid! <br />
Behold the royal prophetess, the fair <br />
Cassandra, dragg&#8217;d by her dishevel&#8217;d hair, <br />
Whom not Minerva&#8217;s shrine, nor sacred bands, <br />
In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands: <br />
On heav&#8217;n she cast her eyes, she sigh&#8217;d, she cried- <br />
&#8216;T was all she could&#8211;her tender arms were tied. <br />
So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear; <br />
But, fir&#8217;d with rage, distracted with despair, <br />
Amid the barb&#8217;rous ravishers he flew: <br />
Our leader&#8217;s rash example we pursue. <br />
But storms of stones, from the proud temple&#8217;s height, <br />
Pour down, and on our batter&#8217;d helms alight: <br />
We from our friends receiv&#8217;d this fatal blow, <br />
Who thought us Grecians, as we seem&#8217;d in show. <br />
They aim at the mistaken crests, from high; <br />
And ours beneath the pond&#8217;rous ruin lie. <br />
Then, mov&#8217;d with anger and disdain, to see <br />
Their troops dispers&#8217;d, the royal virgin free, <br />
The Grecians rally, and their pow&#8217;rs unite, <br />
With fury charge us, and renew the fight. <br />
The brother kings with Ajax join their force, <br />
And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse. <br />
&#8220;Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, <br />
Contending for the kingdom of the sky, <br />
South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne; <br />
The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: <br />
Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise, <br />
And, mix&#8217;d with ooze and sand, pollute the skies. <br />
The troops we squander&#8217;d first again appear <br />
From several quarters, and enclose the rear. <br />
They first observe, and to the rest betray, <br />
Our diff&#8217;rent speech; our borrow&#8217;d arms survey. <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with odds, we fall; Coroebus first, <br />
At Pallas&#8217; altar, by Peneleus pierc&#8217;d. <br />
Then Ripheus follow&#8217;d, in th&#8217; unequal fight; <br />
Just of his word, observant of the right: <br />
Heav&#8217;n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends, <br />
With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends. <br />
Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands <br />
Of awful Phoebus, sav&#8217;d from impious hands. <br />
Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear, <br />
What I perform&#8217;d, and what I suffer&#8217;d there; <br />
No sword avoiding in the fatal strife, <br />
Expos&#8217;d to death, and prodigal of life; <br />
Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault: <br />
I strove to have deserv&#8217;d the death I sought. <br />
But, when I could not fight, and would have died, <br />
Borne off to distance by the growing tide, <br />
Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence, <br />
With Pelias wounded, and without defense. <br />
New clamors from th&#8217; invested palace ring: <br />
We run to die, or disengage the king. <br />
So hot th&#8217; assault, so high the tumult rose, <br />
While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose <br />
As all the Dardan and Argolic race <br />
Had been contracted in that narrow space; <br />
Or as all Ilium else were void of fear, <br />
And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. <br />
Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, <br />
Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: <br />
Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold, <br />
Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; <br />
Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th&#8217; ascent, <br />
While with their right they seize the battlement. <br />
From their demolish&#8217;d tow&#8217;rs the Trojans throw <br />
Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; <br />
And heavy beams and rafters from the sides <br />
(Such arms their last necessity provides) <br />
And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, <br />
The marks of state and ancient royalty. <br />
The guards below, fix&#8217;d in the pass, attend <br />
The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. <br />
Renew&#8217;d in courage with recover&#8217;d breath, <br />
A second time we ran to tempt our death, <br />
To clear the palace from the foe, succeed <br />
The weary living, and revenge the dead. <br />
&#8220;A postern door, yet unobserv&#8217;d and free, <br />
Join&#8217;d by the length of a blind gallery, <br />
To the king&#8217;s closet led: a way well known <br />
To Hector&#8217;s wife, while Priam held the throne, <br />
Thro&#8217; which she brought Astyanax, unseen, <br />
To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire&#8217;s queen. <br />
Thro&#8217; this we pass, and mount the tow&#8217;r, from whence <br />
With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense. <br />
From this the trembling king had oft descried <br />
The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. <br />
Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew, <br />
Then, wrenching with our hands, th&#8217; assault renew; <br />
And, where the rafters on the columns meet, <br />
We push them headlong with our arms and feet. <br />
The lightning flies not swifter than the fall, <br />
Nor thunder louder than the ruin&#8217;d wall: <br />
Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath <br />
Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death. <br />
Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent; <br />
We cease not from above, nor they below relent. <br />
Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat&#8217;ning loud, <br />
With glitt&#8217;ring arms conspicuous in the crowd. <br />
So shines, renew&#8217;d in youth, the crested snake, <br />
Who slept the winter in a thorny brake, <br />
And, casting off his slough when spring returns, <br />
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns; <br />
Restor&#8217;d with pois&#8217;nous herbs, his ardent sides <br />
Reflect the sun; and rais&#8217;d on spires he rides; <br />
High o&#8217;er the grass, hissing he rolls along, <br />
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue. <br />
Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon, <br />
His father&#8217;s charioteer, together run <br />
To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry <br />
Rush on in crowds, and the barr&#8217;d passage free. <br />
Ent&#8217;ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend; <br />
And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. <br />
Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, <br />
And with his ax repeated strokes bestows <br />
On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, <br />
Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. <br />
He hews apace; the double bars at length <br />
Yield to his ax and unresisted strength. <br />
A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal&#8217;d <br />
Appear, and all the palace is reveal&#8217;d; <br />
The halls of audience, and of public state, <br />
And where the lonely queen in secret sate. <br />
Arm&#8217;d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, <br />
With not a door, and scarce a space, between. <br />
The house is fill&#8217;d with loud laments and cries, <br />
And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies; <br />
The fearful matrons run from place to place, <br />
And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. <br />
The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies, <br />
And all his father sparkles in his eyes; <br />
Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain: <br />
The bars are broken, and the guards are slain. <br />
In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; <br />
Those few defendants whom they find, they kill. <br />
Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood <br />
Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; <br />
Bears down the dams with unresisted sway, <br />
And sweeps the cattle and the cots away. <br />
These eyes beheld him when he march&#8217;d between <br />
The brother kings: I saw th&#8217; unhappy queen, <br />
The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood, <br />
To stain his hallow&#8217;d altar with his brood. <br />
The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, <br />
So large a promise, of a progeny), <br />
The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils, <br />
Fell the reward of the proud victor&#8217;s toils. <br />
Where&#8217;er the raging fire had left a space, <br />
The Grecians enter and possess the place. <br />
&#8220;Perhaps you may of Priam&#8217;s fate enquire. <br />
He, when he saw his regal town on fire, <br />
His ruin&#8217;d palace, and his ent&#8217;ring foes, <br />
On ev&#8217;ry side inevitable woes, <br />
In arms, disus&#8217;d, invests his limbs, decay&#8217;d, <br />
Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. <br />
His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; <br />
Loaded, not arm&#8217;d, he creeps along with pain, <br />
Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! <br />
Uncover&#8217;d but by heav&#8217;n, there stood in view <br />
An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, <br />
Dodder&#8217;d with age, whose boughs encompass round <br />
The household gods, and shade the holy ground. <br />
Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train <br />
Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. <br />
Driv&#8217;n like a flock of doves along the sky, <br />
Their images they hug, and to their altars fly. <br />
The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, <br />
And hanging by his side a heavy sword, <br />
&#8216;What rage,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;has seiz&#8217;d my husband&#8217;s mind? <br />
What arms are these, and to what use design&#8217;d? <br />
These times want other aids! Were Hector here, <br />
Ev&#8217;n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. <br />
With us, one common shelter thou shalt find, <br />
Or in one common fate with us be join&#8217;d.&#8217; <br />
She said, and with a last salute embrac&#8217;d <br />
The poor old man, and by the laurel plac&#8217;d. <br />
Behold! Polites, one of Priam&#8217;s sons, <br />
Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs. <br />
Thro&#8217; swords and foes, amaz&#8217;d and hurt, he flies <br />
Thro&#8217; empty courts and open galleries. <br />
Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, <br />
And often reaches, and his thrusts renews. <br />
The youth, transfix&#8217;d, with lamentable cries, <br />
Expires before his wretched parent&#8217;s eyes: <br />
Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw, <br />
The fear of death gave place to nature&#8217;s law; <br />
And, shaking more with anger than with age, <br />
&#8216;The gods,&#8217; said he, &#8216;requite thy brutal rage! <br />
As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, <br />
If there be gods in heav&#8217;n, and gods be just&#8211; <br />
Who tak&#8217;st in wrongs an insolent delight; <br />
With a son&#8217;s death t&#8217; infect a father&#8217;s sight. <br />
Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire <br />
To call thee his&#8211;not he, thy vaunted sire, <br />
Thus us&#8217;d my wretched age: the gods he fear&#8217;d, <br />
The laws of nature and of nations heard. <br />
He cheer&#8217;d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold, <br />
The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold; <br />
Pitied the woes a parent underwent, <br />
And sent me back in safety from his tent.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, <br />
Which, flutt&#8217;ring, seem&#8217;d to loiter as it flew: <br />
Just, and but barely, to the mark it held, <br />
And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. <br />
&#8220;Then Pyrrhus thus: &#8216;Go thou from me to fate, <br />
And to my father my foul deeds relate. <br />
Now die!&#8217; With that he dragg&#8217;d the trembling sire, <br />
Slidd&#8217;ring thro&#8217; clotter&#8217;d blood and holy mire, <br />
(The mingled paste his murder&#8217;d son had made,) <br />
Haul&#8217;d from beneath the violated shade, <br />
And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. <br />
His right hand held his bloody falchion bare, <br />
His left he twisted in his hoary hair; <br />
Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found: <br />
The lukewarm blood came rushing thro&#8217; the wound, <br />
And sanguine streams distain&#8217;d the sacred ground. <br />
Thus Priam fell, and shar&#8217;d one common fate <br />
With Troy in ashes, and his ruin&#8217;d state: <br />
He, who the scepter of all Asia sway&#8217;d, <br />
Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey&#8217;d. <br />
On the bleak shore now lies th&#8217; abandon&#8217;d king, <br />
A headless carcass, and a nameless thing. <br />
&#8220;Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood <br />
Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: <br />
My father&#8217;s image fill&#8217;d my pious mind, <br />
Lest equal years might equal fortune find. <br />
Again I thought on my forsaken wife, <br />
And trembled for my son&#8217;s abandon&#8217;d life. <br />
I look&#8217;d about, but found myself alone, <br />
Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. <br />
Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress&#8217;d, <br />
Leap&#8217;d headlong from the heights; the flames consum&#8217;d the rest. <br />
Thus, wand&#8217;ring in my way, without a guide, <br />
The graceless Helen in the porch I spied <br />
Of Vesta&#8217;s temple; there she lurk&#8217;d alone; <br />
Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: <br />
But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, <br />
That common bane of Greece and Troy I found. <br />
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; <br />
More dreads the vengeance of her injur&#8217;d lord; <br />
Ev&#8217;n by those gods who refug&#8217;d her abhorr&#8217;d. <br />
Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to give her guilt the due reward: <br />
&#8216;Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, <br />
And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind? <br />
Shall she her kingdom and her friends review, <br />
In state attended with a captive crew, <br />
While unreveng&#8217;d the good old Priam falls, <br />
And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls? <br />
For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood <br />
Were swell&#8217;d with bodies, and were drunk with blood? <br />
&#8216;T is true, a soldier can small honor gain, <br />
And boast no conquest, from a woman slain: <br />
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause, <br />
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause; <br />
The punish&#8217;d crime shall set my soul at ease, <br />
And murm&#8217;ring manes of my friends appease.&#8217; <br />
Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light <br />
Spread o&#8217;er the place; and, shining heav&#8217;nly bright, <br />
My mother stood reveal&#8217;d before my sight <br />
Never so radiant did her eyes appear; <br />
Not her own star confess&#8217;d a light so clear: <br />
Great in her charms, as when on gods above <br />
She looks, and breathes herself into their love. <br />
She held my hand, the destin&#8217;d blow to break; <br />
Then from her rosy lips began to speak: <br />
&#8216;My son, from whence this madness, this neglect <br />
Of my commands, and those whom I protect? <br />
Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind <br />
Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. <br />
Look if your helpless father yet survive, <br />
Or if Ascanius or Creusa live. <br />
Around your house the greedy Grecians err; <br />
And these had perish&#8217;d in the nightly war, <br />
But for my presence and protecting care. <br />
Not Helen&#8217;s face, nor Paris, was in fault; <br />
But by the gods was this destruction brought. <br />
Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve <br />
The mists and films that mortal eyes involve, <br />
Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see <br />
The shape of each avenging deity. <br />
Enlighten&#8217;d thus, my just commands fulfil, <br />
Nor fear obedience to your mother&#8217;s will. <br />
Where yon disorder&#8217;d heap of ruin lies, <br />
Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise&#8211; <br />
Amid that smother Neptune holds his place, <br />
Below the wall&#8217;s foundation drives his mace, <br />
And heaves the building from the solid base. <br />
Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands <br />
Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands, <br />
Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands. <br />
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, <br />
Bestrides the tow&#8217;r, refulgent thro&#8217; the cloud: <br />
See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies, <br />
And arms against the town the partial deities. <br />
Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end: <br />
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: <br />
Haste; and a mother&#8217;s care your passage shall befriend.&#8217; <br />
She said, and swiftly vanish&#8217;d from my sight, <br />
Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night. <br />
I look&#8217;d, I listen&#8217;d; dreadful sounds I hear; <br />
And the dire forms of hostile gods appear. <br />
Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent), <br />
And Ilium from its old foundations rent; <br />
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar&#8217;d the winds, <br />
And stood the sturdy strokes of lab&#8217;ring hinds. <br />
About the roots the cruel ax resounds; <br />
The stumps are pierc&#8217;d with oft-repeated wounds: <br />
The war is felt on high; the nodding crown <br />
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down. <br />
To their united force it yields, tho&#8217; late, <br />
And mourns with mortal groans th&#8217; approaching fate: <br />
The roots no more their upper load sustain; <br />
But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro&#8217; the plain. <br />
&#8220;Descending thence, I scape thro&#8217; foes and fire: <br />
Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. <br />
Arriv&#8217;d at home, he, for whose only sake, <br />
Or most for his, such toils I undertake, <br />
The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, <br />
I purpos&#8217;d to secure on Ida&#8217;s height, <br />
Refus&#8217;d the journey, resolute to die <br />
And add his fun&#8217;rals to the fate of Troy, <br />
Rather than exile and old age sustain. <br />
&#8216;Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev&#8217;ry vein. <br />
Had Heav&#8217;n decreed that I should life enjoy, <br />
Heav&#8217;n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. <br />
&#8216;T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, <br />
Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. <br />
Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, <br />
And give this useless corpse a long adieu. <br />
These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; <br />
At least the pitying foes will aid my death, <br />
To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: <br />
As for my sepulcher, let Heav&#8217;n take care. <br />
&#8216;T is long since I, for my celestial wife <br />
Loath&#8217;d by the gods, have dragg&#8217;d a ling&#8217;ring life; <br />
Since ev&#8217;ry hour and moment I expire, <br />
Blasted from heav&#8217;n by Jove&#8217;s avenging fire.&#8217; <br />
This oft repeated, he stood fix&#8217;d to die: <br />
Myself, my wife, my son, my family, <br />
Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry&#8211; <br />
&#8216;What, will he still persist, on death resolve, <br />
And in his ruin all his house involve!&#8217; <br />
He still persists his reasons to maintain; <br />
Our pray&#8217;rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. <br />
&#8220;Urg&#8217;d by despair, again I go to try <br />
The fate of arms, resolv&#8217;d in fight to die: <br />
&#8216;What hope remains, but what my death must give? <br />
Can I, without so dear a father, live? <br />
You term it prudence, what I baseness call: <br />
Could such a word from such a parent fall? <br />
If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, <br />
That nothing should of ruin&#8217;d Troy remain, <br />
And you conspire with Fortune to be slain, <br />
The way to death is wide, th&#8217; approaches near: <br />
For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, <br />
Reeking with Priam&#8217;s blood&#8211;the wretch who slew <br />
The son (inhuman) in the father&#8217;s view, <br />
And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. <br />
O goddess mother, give me back to Fate; <br />
Your gift was undesir&#8217;d, and came too late! <br />
Did you, for this, unhappy me convey <br />
Thro&#8217; foes and fires, to see my house a prey? <br />
Shall I my father, wife, and son behold, <br />
Welt&#8217;ring in blood, each other&#8217;s arms infold? <br />
Haste! gird my sword, tho&#8217; spent and overcome: <br />
&#8216;T is the last summons to receive our doom. <br />
I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call! <br />
Not unreveng&#8217;d the foe shall see my fall. <br />
Restore me to the yet unfinish&#8217;d fight: <br />
My death is wanting to conclude the night.&#8217; <br />
Arm&#8217;d once again, my glitt&#8217;ring sword I wield, <br />
While th&#8217; other hand sustains my weighty shield, <br />
And forth I rush to seek th&#8217; abandon&#8217;d field. <br />
I went; but sad Creusa stopp&#8217;d my way, <br />
And cross the threshold in my passage lay, <br />
Embrac&#8217;d my knees, and, when I would have gone, <br />
Shew&#8217;d me my feeble sire and tender son: <br />
&#8216;If death be your design, at least,&#8217; said she, <br />
&#8216;Take us along to share your destiny. <br />
If any farther hopes in arms remain, <br />
This place, these pledges of your love, maintain. <br />
To whom do you expose your father&#8217;s life, <br />
Your son&#8217;s, and mine, your now forgotten wife!&#8217; <br />
While thus she fills the house with clam&#8217;rous cries, <br />
Our hearing is diverted by our eyes: <br />
For, while I held my son, in the short space <br />
Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace; <br />
Strange to relate, from young Iulus&#8217; head <br />
A lambent flame arose, which gently spread <br />
Around his brows, and on his temples fed. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d, with running water we prepare <br />
To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair; <br />
But old Anchises, vers&#8217;d in omens, rear&#8217;d <br />
His hands to heav&#8217;n, and this request preferr&#8217;d: <br />
&#8216;If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend <br />
Thy will; if piety can pray&#8217;rs commend, <br />
Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas&#8217;d to send.&#8217; <br />
Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear <br />
A peal of rattling thunder roll in air: <br />
There shot a streaming lamp along the sky, <br />
Which on the winged lightning seem&#8217;d to fly; <br />
From o&#8217;er the roof the blaze began to move, <br />
And, trailing, vanish&#8217;d in th&#8217; Idaean grove. <br />
It swept a path in heav&#8217;n, and shone a guide, <br />
Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died. <br />
&#8220;The good old man with suppliant hands implor&#8217;d <br />
The gods&#8217; protection, and their star ador&#8217;d. <br />
&#8216;Now, now,&#8217; said he, &#8216;my son, no more delay! <br />
I yield, I follow where Heav&#8217;n shews the way. <br />
Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place, <br />
And guard this relic of the Trojan race, <br />
This tender child! These omens are your own, <br />
And you can yet restore the ruin&#8217;d town. <br />
At least accomplish what your signs foreshow: <br />
I stand resign&#8217;d, and am prepar&#8217;d to go.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;He said. The crackling flames appear on high. <br />
And driving sparkles dance along the sky. <br />
With Vulcan&#8217;s rage the rising winds conspire, <br />
And near our palace roll the flood of fire. <br />
&#8216;Haste, my dear father, (&#8216;t is no time to wait,) <br />
And load my shoulders with a willing freight. <br />
Whate&#8217;er befalls, your life shall be my care; <br />
One death, or one deliv&#8217;rance, we will share. <br />
My hand shall lead our little son; and you, <br />
My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue. <br />
Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands: <br />
Without the walls a ruin&#8217;d temple stands, <br />
To Ceres hallow&#8217;d once; a cypress nigh <br />
Shoots up her venerable head on high, <br />
By long religion kept; there bend your feet, <br />
And in divided parties let us meet. <br />
Our country gods, the relics, and the bands, <br />
Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands: <br />
In me &#8216;t is impious holy things to bear, <br />
Red as I am with slaughter, new from war, <br />
Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt <br />
Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.&#8217; <br />
Thus, ord&#8217;ring all that prudence could provide, <br />
I clothe my shoulders with a lion&#8217;s hide <br />
And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, <br />
The welcome load of my dear father take; <br />
While on my better hand Ascanius hung, <br />
And with unequal paces tripp&#8217;d along. <br />
Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray <br />
Thro&#8217; ev&#8217;ry dark and ev&#8217;ry devious way. <br />
I, who so bold and dauntless, just before, <br />
The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore, <br />
At ev&#8217;ry shadow now am seiz&#8217;d with fear, <br />
Not for myself, but for the charge I bear; <br />
Till, near the ruin&#8217;d gate arriv&#8217;d at last, <br />
Secure, and deeming all the danger past, <br />
A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. <br />
My father, looking thro&#8217; the shades, with fear, <br />
Cried out: &#8216;Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh; <br />
Their swords and shining armor I descry.&#8217; <br />
Some hostile god, for some unknown offense, <br />
Had sure bereft my mind of better sense; <br />
For, while thro&#8217; winding ways I took my flight, <br />
And sought the shelter of the gloomy night, <br />
Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell <br />
If by her fatal destiny she fell, <br />
Or weary sate, or wander&#8217;d with affright; <br />
But she was lost for ever to my sight. <br />
I knew not, or reflected, till I meet <br />
My friends, at Ceres&#8217; now deserted seat. <br />
We met: not one was wanting; only she <br />
Deceiv&#8217;d her friends, her son, and wretched me. <br />
&#8220;What mad expressions did my tongue refuse! <br />
Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse! <br />
This was the fatal blow, that pain&#8217;d me more <br />
Than all I felt from ruin&#8217;d Troy before. <br />
Stung with my loss, and raving with despair, <br />
Abandoning my now forgotten care, <br />
Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft, <br />
My sire, my son, my country gods I left. <br />
In shining armor once again I sheathe <br />
My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. <br />
Then headlong to the burning walls I run, <br />
And seek the danger I was forc&#8217;d to shun. <br />
I tread my former tracks; thro&#8217; night explore <br />
Each passage, ev&#8217;ry street I cross&#8217;d before. <br />
All things were full of horror and affright, <br />
And dreadful ev&#8217;n the silence of the night. <br />
Then to my father&#8217;s house I make repair, <br />
With some small glimpse of hope to find her there. <br />
Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met; <br />
The house was fill&#8217;d with foes, with flames beset. <br />
Driv&#8217;n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire, <br />
Thro&#8217; air transported, to the roofs aspire. <br />
From thence to Priam&#8217;s palace I resort, <br />
And search the citadel and desart court. <br />
Then, unobserv&#8217;d, I pass by Juno&#8217;s church: <br />
A guard of Grecians had possess&#8217;d the porch; <br />
There Phoenix and Ulysses watch the prey, <br />
And thither all the wealth of Troy convey: <br />
The spoils which they from ransack&#8217;d houses brought, <br />
And golden bowls from burning altars caught, <br />
The tables of the gods, the purple vests, <br />
The people&#8217;s treasure, and the pomp of priests. <br />
A rank of wretched youths, with pinion&#8217;d hands, <br />
And captive matrons, in long order stands. <br />
Then, with ungovern&#8217;d madness, I proclaim, <br />
Thro&#8217; all the silent street, Creusa&#8217;s name: <br />
Creusa still I call; at length she hears, <br />
And sudden thro&#8217; the shades of night appears&#8211; <br />
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, <br />
But a pale specter, larger than the life. <br />
Aghast, astonish&#8217;d, and struck dumb with fear, <br />
I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen&#8217;d hair. <br />
Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief <br />
&#8216;Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. <br />
Desist, my much-lov&#8217;d lord, &#8216;t indulge your pain; <br />
You bear no more than what the gods ordain. <br />
My fates permit me not from hence to fly; <br />
Nor he, the great controller of the sky. <br />
Long wand&#8217;ring ways for you the pow&#8217;rs decree; <br />
On land hard labors, and a length of sea. <br />
Then, after many painful years are past, <br />
On Latium&#8217;s happy shore you shall be cast, <br />
Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds <br />
The flow&#8217;ry meadows, and the feeding folds. <br />
There end your toils; and there your fates provide <br />
A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: <br />
There fortune shall the Trojan line restore, <br />
And you for lost Creusa weep no more. <br />
Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, <br />
Th&#8217; imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame; <br />
Or, stooping to the victor&#8217;s lust, disgrace <br />
My goddess mother, or my royal race. <br />
And now, farewell! The parent of the gods <br />
Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes: <br />
I trust our common issue to your care.&#8217; <br />
She said, and gliding pass&#8217;d unseen in air. <br />
I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; <br />
And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, <br />
And, thrice deceiv&#8217;d, on vain embraces hung. <br />
Light as an empty dream at break of day, <br />
Or as a blast of wind, she rush&#8217;d away. <br />
&#8220;Thus having pass&#8217;d the night in fruitless pain, <br />
I to my longing friends return again, <br />
Amaz&#8217;d th&#8217; augmented number to behold, <br />
Of men and matrons mix&#8217;d, of young and old; <br />
A wretched exil&#8217;d crew together brought, <br />
With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d, and willing, under my command, <br />
To run all hazards both of sea and land. <br />
The Morn began, from Ida, to display <br />
Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: <br />
Before the gates the Grecians took their post, <br />
And all pretense of late relief was lost. <br />
I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, <br />
And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.&#8221;</p>
