				<p>THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; The Sibyl foretells AEneas the adventures he<br />
should meet with in Italy. She attends him to hell; describing to<br />
him the various scenes of that place, and conducting him to his<br />
father Anchises, who instructs him in those sublime mysteries of the<br />
soul of the world, and the transmigration; and shews him that<br />
glorious race of heroes which was to descend from him, and his<br />
posterity.</p>
<p>HE said, and wept; then spread his sails before <br />
The winds, and reach&#8217;d at length the Cumaean shore: <br />
Their anchors dropp&#8217;d, his crew the vessels moor. <br />
They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land, <br />
And greet with greedy joy th&#8217; Italian strand. <br />
Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; <br />
Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, <br />
Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, <br />
Or trace thro&#8217; valleys the discover&#8217;d floods. <br />
Thus, while their sev&#8217;ral charges they fulfil, <br />
The pious prince ascends the sacred hill <br />
Where Phoebus is ador&#8217;d; and seeks the shade <br />
Which hides from sight his venerable maid. <br />
Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode; <br />
Thence full of fate returns, and of the god. <br />
Thro&#8217; Trivia&#8217;s grove they walk; and now behold, <br />
And enter now, the temple roof&#8217;d with gold. <br />
When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore, <br />
His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore, <br />
(The first who sail&#8217;d in air,) &#8216;t is sung by Fame, <br />
To the Cumaean coast at length he came, <br />
And here alighting, built this costly frame. <br />
Inscrib&#8217;d to Phoebus, here he hung on high <br />
The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky: <br />
Then o&#8217;er the lofty gate his art emboss&#8217;d <br />
Androgeos&#8217; death, and off&#8217;rings to his ghost; <br />
Sev&#8217;n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet <br />
The fate appointed by revengeful Crete. <br />
And next to those the dreadful urn was plac&#8217;d, <br />
In which the destin&#8217;d names by lots were cast: <br />
The mournful parents stand around in tears, <br />
And rising Crete against their shore appears. <br />
There too, in living sculpture, might be seen <br />
The mad affection of the Cretan queen; <br />
Then how she cheats her bellowing lover&#8217;s eye; <br />
The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny, <br />
The lower part a beast, a man above, <br />
The monument of their polluted love. <br />
Not far from thence he grav&#8217;d the wondrous maze, <br />
A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways: <br />
Here dwells the monster, hid from human view, <br />
Not to be found, but by the faithful clew; <br />
Till the kind artist, mov&#8217;d with pious grief, <br />
Lent to the loving maid this last relief, <br />
And all those erring paths describ&#8217;d so well <br />
That Theseus conquer&#8217;d and the monster fell. <br />
Here hapless Icarus had found his part, <br />
Had not the father&#8217;s grief restrain&#8217;d his art. <br />
He twice assay&#8217;d to cast his son in gold; <br />
Twice from his hands he dropp&#8217;d the forming mold. <br />
All this with wond&#8217;ring eyes AEneas view&#8217;d; <br />
Each varying object his delight renew&#8217;d: <br />
Eager to read the rest&#8211;Achates came, <br />
And by his side the mad divining dame, <br />
The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name. <br />
&#8220;Time suffers not,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to feed your eyes <br />
With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice. <br />
Sev&#8217;n bullocks, yet unyok&#8217;d, for Phoebus choose, <br />
And for Diana sev&#8217;n unspotted ewes.&#8221; <br />
This said, the servants urge the sacred rites, <br />
While to the temple she the prince invites. <br />
A spacious cave, within its farmost part, <br />
Was hew&#8217;d and fashion&#8217;d by laborious art <br />
Thro&#8217; the hill&#8217;s hollow sides: before the place, <br />
A hundred doors a hundred entries grace; <br />
As many voices issue, and the sound <br />
Of Sybil&#8217;s words as many times rebound. <br />
Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries: <br />
&#8220;This is the time; enquire your destinies. <br />
He comes; behold the god!&#8221; Thus while she said, <br />
(And shiv&#8217;ring at the sacred entry stay&#8217;d,) <br />
Her color chang&#8217;d; her face was not the same, <br />
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. <br />
Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess&#8217;d <br />
Her trembling limbs, and heav&#8217;d her lab&#8217;ring breast. <br />
Greater than humankind she seem&#8217;d to look, <br />
And with an accent more than mortal spoke. <br />
Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; <br />
When all the god came rushing on her soul. <br />
Swiftly she turn&#8217;d, and, foaming as she spoke: <br />
&#8220;Why this delay?&#8221; she cried&#8211;&#8221;the pow&#8217;rs invoke! <br />
Thy pray&#8217;rs alone can open this abode; <br />
Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.&#8221; <br />
She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, <br />
O&#8217;erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear. <br />
The prince himself, with awful dread possess&#8217;d, <br />
His vows to great Apollo thus address&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;Indulgent god, propitious pow&#8217;r to Troy, <br />
Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy, <br />
Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart <br />
Pierc&#8217;d the proud Grecian&#8217;s only mortal part: <br />
Thus far, by fate&#8217;s decrees and thy commands, <br />
Thro&#8217; ambient seas and thro&#8217; devouring sands, <br />
Our exil&#8217;d crew has sought th&#8217; Ausonian ground; <br />
And now, at length, the flying coast is found. <br />
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, <br />
With fury has pursued her wand&#8217;ring race. <br />
Here cease, ye pow&#8217;rs, and let your vengeance end: <br />
Troy is no more, and can no more offend. <br />
And thou, O sacred maid, inspir&#8217;d to see <br />
Th&#8217; event of things in dark futurity; <br />
Give me what Heav&#8217;n has promis&#8217;d to my fate, <br />
To conquer and command the Latian state; <br />
To fix my wand&#8217;ring gods, and find a place <br />
For the long exiles of the Trojan race. <br />
Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear <br />
To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray&#8217;r; <br />
And annual rites, and festivals, and games, <br />
Shall be perform&#8217;d to their auspicious names. <br />
Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land; <br />
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand, <br />
Preserv&#8217;d in shrines; and ev&#8217;ry sacred lay, <br />
Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey: <br />
All shall be treasur&#8217;d by a chosen train <br />
Of holy priests, and ever shall remain. <br />
But O! commit not thy prophetic mind <br />
To flitting leaves, the sport of ev&#8217;ry wind, <br />
Lest they disperse in air our empty fate; <br />
Write not, but, what the pow&#8217;rs ordain, relate.&#8221; <br />
Struggling in vain, impatient of her load, <br />
And lab&#8217;ring underneath the pond&#8217;rous god, <br />
The more she strove to shake him from her breast, <br />
With more and far superior force he press&#8217;d; <br />
Commands his entrance, and, without control, <br />
Usurps her organs and inspires her soul. <br />
Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors <br />
Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars <br />
Within the cave, and Sibyl&#8217;s voice restores: <br />
&#8220;Escap&#8217;d the dangers of the wat&#8217;ry reign, <br />
Yet more and greater ills by land remain. <br />
The coast, so long desir&#8217;d (nor doubt th&#8217; event), <br />
Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach&#8217;d, repent. <br />
Wars, horrid wars, I view&#8211;a field of blood, <br />
And Tiber rolling with a purple flood. <br />
Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there: <br />
A new Achilles shall in arms appear, <br />
And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno&#8217;s hate, <br />
Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate. <br />
To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, <br />
Driv&#8217;n to solicit aid at ev&#8217;ry court! <br />
The cause the same which Ilium once oppress&#8217;d; <br />
A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest. <br />
But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, <br />
The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. <br />
The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown <br />
From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.&#8221; <br />
Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, <br />
And the resisting air the thunder broke; <br />
The cave rebellow&#8217;d, and the temple shook. <br />
Th&#8217; ambiguous god, who rul&#8217;d her lab&#8217;ring breast, <br />
In these mysterious words his mind express&#8217;d; <br />
Some truths reveal&#8217;d, in terms involv&#8217;d the rest. <br />
At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas&#8217;d, <br />
And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas&#8217;d. <br />
Then thus the chief: &#8220;No terror to my view, <br />
No frightful face of danger can be new. <br />
Inur&#8217;d to suffer, and resolv&#8217;d to dare, <br />
The Fates, without my pow&#8217;r, shall be without my care. <br />
This let me crave, since near your grove the road <br />
To hell lies open, and the dark abode <br />
Which Acheron surrounds, th&#8217; innavigable flood; <br />
Conduct me thro&#8217; the regions void of light, <br />
And lead me longing to my father&#8217;s sight. <br />
For him, a thousand dangers I have sought, <br />
And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought, <br />
Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought. <br />
He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried, <br />
And wrath of Heav&#8217;n, my still auspicious guide, <br />
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied. <br />
Oft, since he breath&#8217;d his last, in dead of night <br />
His reverend image stood before my sight; <br />
Enjoin&#8217;d to seek, below, his holy shade; <br />
Conducted there by your unerring aid. <br />
But you, if pious minds by pray&#8217;rs are won, <br />
Oblige the father, and protect the son. <br />
Yours is the pow&#8217;r; nor Proserpine in vain <br />
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign. <br />
If Orpheus, arm&#8217;d with his enchanting lyre, <br />
The ruthless king with pity could inspire, <br />
And from the shades below redeem his wife; <br />
If Pollux, off&#8217;ring his alternate life, <br />
Could free his brother, and can daily go <br />
By turns aloft, by turns descend below&#8211; <br />
Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend, <br />
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? <br />
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came; <br />
My mother greater, my descent the same.&#8221; <br />
So pray&#8217;d the Trojan prince, and, while he pray&#8217;d, <br />
His hand upon the holy altar laid. <br />
Then thus replied the prophetess divine: <br />
&#8220;O goddess-born of great Anchises&#8217; line, <br />
The gates of hell are open night and day; <br />
Smooth the descent, and easy is the way: <br />
But to return, and view the cheerful skies, <br />
In this the task and mighty labor lies. <br />
To few great Jupiter imparts this grace, <br />
And those of shining worth and heav&#8217;nly race. <br />
Betwixt those regions and our upper light, <br />
Deep forests and impenetrable night <br />
Possess the middle space: th&#8217; infernal bounds <br />
Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. <br />
But if so dire a love your soul invades, <br />
As twice below to view the trembling shades; <br />
If you so hard a toil will undertake, <br />
As twice to pass th&#8217; innavigable lake; <br />
Receive my counsel. In the neighb&#8217;ring grove <br />
There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove <br />
Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night <br />
Conceal the happy plant from human sight. <br />
One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) <br />
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: <br />
This from the vulgar branches must be torn, <br />
And to fair Proserpine the present borne, <br />
Ere leave be giv&#8217;n to tempt the nether skies. <br />
The first thus rent a second will arise, <br />
And the same metal the same room supplies. <br />
Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see <br />
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: <br />
Then rend it off, as holy rites command; <br />
The willing metal will obey thy hand, <br />
Following with ease, if favor&#8217;d by thy fate, <br />
Thou art foredoom&#8217;d to view the Stygian state: <br />
If not, no labor can the tree constrain; <br />
And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. <br />
Besides, you know not, while you here attend, <br />
Th&#8217; unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: <br />
Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, <br />
Depriv&#8217;d of fun&#8217;ral rites, pollutes your host. <br />
Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, <br />
Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; <br />
Then, living turfs upon his body lay: <br />
This done, securely take the destin&#8217;d way, <br />
To find the regions destitute of day.&#8221; <br />
She said, and held her peace. AEneas went <br />
Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, <br />
Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. <br />
Achates, the companion of his breast, <br />
Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress&#8217;d. <br />
Walking, they talk&#8217;d, and fruitlessly divin&#8217;d <br />
What friend the priestess by those words design&#8217;d. <br />
But soon they found an object to deplore: <br />
Misenus lay extended on the shore; <br />
Son of the God of Winds: none so renown&#8217;d <br />
The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; <br />
With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, <br />
And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms. <br />
He serv&#8217;d great Hector, and was ever near, <br />
Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. <br />
But by Pelides&#8217; arms when Hector fell, <br />
He chose AEneas; and he chose as well. <br />
Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, <br />
He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; <br />
With envy Triton heard the martial sound, <br />
And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown&#8217;d; <br />
Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: <br />
The gazing crowd around the body stand. <br />
All weep; but most AEneas mourns his fate, <br />
And hastens to perform the funeral state. <br />
In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; <br />
The basis broad below, and top advanc&#8217;d in air. <br />
An ancient wood, fit for the work design&#8217;d, <br />
(The shady covert of the salvage kind,) <br />
The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; <br />
Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow&#8217;ring pride <br />
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, <br />
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak. <br />
Huge trunks of trees, fell&#8217;d from the steepy crown <br />
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. <br />
Arm&#8217;d like the rest the Trojan prince appears, <br />
And by his pious labor urges theirs. <br />
Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind <br />
The ways to compass what his wish design&#8217;d, <br />
He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, <br />
And then with vows implor&#8217;d the Queen of Love: <br />
&#8220;O may thy pow&#8217;r, propitious still to me, <br />
Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, <br />
In this deep forest; since the Sibyl&#8217;s breath <br />
Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus&#8217; death.&#8221; <br />
Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, <br />
Two doves, descending from their airy flight, <br />
Secure upon the grassy plain alight. <br />
He knew his mother&#8217;s birds; and thus he pray&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid, <br />
And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, <br />
Whose glitt&#8217;ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. <br />
And thou, great parent, with celestial care, <br />
In this distress be present to my pray&#8217;r!&#8217; <br />
Thus having said, he stopp&#8217;d with watchful sight, <br />
Observing still the motions of their flight, <br />
What course they took, what happy signs they shew. <br />
They fed, and, flutt&#8217;ring, by degrees withdrew <br />
Still farther from the place, but still in view: <br />
Hopping and flying, thus they led him on <br />
To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun <br />
They wing&#8217;d their flight aloft; then, stooping low, <br />
Perch&#8217;d on the double tree that bears the golden bough. <br />
Thro&#8217; the green leafs the glitt&#8217;ring shadows glow; <br />
As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, <br />
Where the proud mother views her precious brood, <br />
And happier branches, which she never sow&#8217;d. <br />
Such was the glitt&#8217;ring; such the ruddy rind, <br />
And dancing leaves, that wanton&#8217;d in the wind. <br />
He seiz&#8217;d the shining bough with griping hold, <br />
And rent away, with ease, the ling&#8217;ring gold; <br />
Then to the Sibyl&#8217;s palace bore the prize. <br />
Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, <br />
To dead Misenus pay his obsequies. <br />
First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear, <br />
Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: <br />
The fabric&#8217;s front with cypress twigs they strew, <br />
And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. <br />
The topmost part his glitt&#8217;ring arms adorn; <br />
Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne, <br />
Are pour&#8217;d to wash his body, joint by joint, <br />
And fragrant oils the stiffen&#8217;d limbs anoint. <br />
With groans and cries Misenus they deplore: <br />
Then on a bier, with purple cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
The breathless body, thus bewail&#8217;d, they lay, <br />
And fire the pile, their faces turn&#8217;d away&#8211; <br />
Such reverend rites their fathers us&#8217;d to pay. <br />
Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw, <br />
And fat of victims, which his friends bestow. <br />
These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; <br />
Then on the living coals red wine they pour; <br />
And, last, the relics by themselves dispose, <br />
Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose. <br />
Old Corynaeus compass&#8217;d thrice the crew, <br />
And dipp&#8217;d an olive branch in holy dew; <br />
Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud <br />
Invok&#8217;d the dead, and then dismiss&#8217;d the crowd. <br />
But good AEneas order&#8217;d on the shore <br />
A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore, <br />
A soldier&#8217;s fauchion, and a seaman&#8217;s oar. <br />
Thus was his friend interr&#8217;d; and deathless fame <br />
Still to the lofty cape consigns his name. <br />
These rites perform&#8217;d, the prince, without delay, <br />
Hastes to the nether world his destin&#8217;d way. <br />
Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went <br />
From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; <br />
And here th&#8217; access a gloomy grove defends, <br />
And there th&#8217; unnavigable lake extends, <br />
O&#8217;er whose unhappy waters, void of light, <br />
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight; <br />
Such deadly stenches from the depths arise, <br />
And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. <br />
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make, <br />
And give the name Avernus to the lake. <br />
Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, <br />
For sacrifice the pious hero brought. <br />
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; <br />
Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, <br />
Invoking Hecate hither to repair: <br />
A pow&#8217;rful name in hell and upper air. <br />
The sacred priests with ready knives bereave <br />
The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive <br />
The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night <br />
(The sable wool without a streak of white) <br />
AEneas offers; and, by fate&#8217;s decree, <br />
A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, <br />
With holocausts he Pluto&#8217;s altar fills; <br />
Sev&#8217;n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; <br />
Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours; <br />
Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. <br />
Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, <br />
Nor ended till the next returning sun. <br />
Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, <br />
And howling dogs in glimm&#8217;ring light advance, <br />
Ere Hecate came. &#8220;Far hence be souls profane!&#8221; <br />
The Sibyl cried, &#8220;and from the grove abstain! <br />
Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford; <br />
Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.&#8221; <br />
She said, and pass&#8217;d along the gloomy space; <br />
The prince pursued her steps with equal pace. <br />
Ye realms, yet unreveal&#8217;d to human sight, <br />
Ye gods who rule the regions of the night, <br />
Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate <br />
The mystic wonders of your silent state! <br />
Obscure they went thro&#8217; dreary shades, that led <br />
Along the waste dominions of the dead. <br />
Thus wander travelers in woods by night, <br />
By the moon&#8217;s doubtful and malignant light, <br />
When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies, <br />
And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes. <br />
Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell, <br />
Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell, <br />
And pale Diseases, and repining Age, <br />
Want, Fear, and Famine&#8217;s unresisted rage; <br />
Here Toils, and Death, and Death&#8217;s half-brother, Sleep, <br />
Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep; <br />
With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind, <br />
Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind; <br />
The Furies&#8217; iron beds; and Strife, that shakes <br />
Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes. <br />
Full in the midst of this infernal road, <br />
An elm displays her dusky arms abroad: <br />
The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head, <br />
And empty dreams on ev&#8217;ry leaf are spread. <br />
Of various forms unnumber&#8217;d specters more, <br />
Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. <br />
Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, <br />
And Briareus with all his hundred hands; <br />
Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; <br />
And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame. <br />
The chief unsheath&#8217;d his shining steel, prepar&#8217;d, <br />
Tho&#8217; seiz&#8217;d with sudden fear, to force the guard, <br />
Off&#8217;ring his brandish&#8217;d weapon at their face; <br />
Had not the Sibyl stopp&#8217;d his eager pace, <br />
And told him what those empty phantoms were: <br />
Forms without bodies, and impassive air. <br />
Hence to deep Acheron they take their way, <br />
Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, <br />
Are whirl&#8217;d aloft, and in Cocytus lost. <br />
There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast&#8211; <br />
A sordid god: down from his hoary chin <br />
A length of beard descends, uncomb&#8217;d, unclean; <br />
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; <br />
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. <br />
He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; <br />
The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears. <br />
He look&#8217;d in years; yet in his years were seen <br />
A youthful vigor and autumnal green. <br />
An airy crowd came rushing where he stood, <br />
Which fill&#8217;d the margin of the fatal flood: <br />
Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, <br />
And mighty heroes&#8217; more majestic shades, <br />
And youths, intomb&#8217;d before their fathers&#8217; eyes, <br />
With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. <br />
Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, <br />
Or fowls, by winter forc&#8217;d, forsake the floods, <br />
And wing their hasty flight to happier lands; <br />
Such, and so thick, the shiv&#8217;ring army stands, <br />
And press for passage with extended hands. <br />
Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore: <br />
The rest he drove to distance from the shore. <br />
The hero, who beheld with wond&#8217;ring eyes <br />
The tumult mix&#8217;d with shrieks, laments, and cries, <br />
Ask&#8217;d of his guide, what the rude concourse meant; <br />
Why to the shore the thronging people bent; <br />
What forms of law among the ghosts were us&#8217;d; <br />
Why some were ferried o&#8217;er, and some refus&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,&#8221; <br />
The Sibyl said, &#8220;you see the Stygian floods, <br />
The sacred stream which heav&#8217;n&#8217;s imperial state <br />
Attests in oaths, and fears to violate. <br />
The ghosts rejected are th&#8217; unhappy crew <br />
Depriv&#8217;d of sepulchers and fun&#8217;ral due: <br />
The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, <br />
He ferries over to the farther coast; <br />
Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves <br />
With such whose bones are not compos&#8217;d in graves. <br />
A hundred years they wander on the shore; <br />
At length, their penance done, are wafted o&#8217;er.&#8221; <br />
The Trojan chief his forward pace repress&#8217;d, <br />
Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast, <br />
He saw his friends, who, whelm&#8217;d beneath the waves, <br />
Their fun&#8217;ral honors claim&#8217;d, and ask&#8217;d their quiet graves. <br />
The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew, <br />
And the brave leader of the Lycian crew, <br />
Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; <br />
The sailors master&#8217;d, and the ship o&#8217;erset. <br />
Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press&#8217;d, <br />
Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, <br />
Who, while he steering view&#8217;d the stars, and bore <br />
His course from Afric to the Latian shore, <br />
Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix&#8217;d his view, <br />
And scarcely thro&#8217; the gloom the sullen shadow knew. <br />
Then thus the prince: &#8220;What envious pow&#8217;r, O friend, <br />
Brought your lov&#8217;d life to this disastrous end? <br />
For Phoebus, ever true in all he said, <br />
Has in your fate alone my faith betray&#8217;d. <br />
The god foretold you should not die, before <br />
You reach&#8217;d, secure from seas, th&#8217; Italian shore. <br />
Is this th&#8217; unerring pow&#8217;r?&#8221; The ghost replied; <br />
&#8220;Nor Phoebus flatter&#8217;d, nor his answers lied; <br />
Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: <br />
But, while the stars and course of heav&#8217;n I keep, <br />
My wearied eyes were seiz&#8217;d with fatal sleep. <br />
I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain&#8217;d <br />
Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain&#8217;d. <br />
Now by the winds and raging waves I swear, <br />
Your safety, more than mine, was then my care; <br />
Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, <br />
Your ship should run against the rocky coast. <br />
Three blust&#8217;ring nights, borne by the southern blast, <br />
I floated, and discover&#8217;d land at last: <br />
High on a mounting wave my head I bore, <br />
Forcing my strength, and gath&#8217;ring to the shore. <br />
Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz&#8217;d <br />
The craggy cliffs, and my tir&#8217;d members eas&#8217;d. <br />
While, cumber&#8217;d with my dropping clothes, I lay, <br />
The cruel nation, covetous of prey, <br />
Stain&#8217;d with my blood th&#8217; unhospitable coast; <br />
And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss&#8217;d: <br />
Which O avert, by yon ethereal light, <br />
Which I have lost for this eternal night! <br />
Or, if by dearer ties you may be won, <br />
By your dead sire, and by your living son, <br />
Redeem from this reproach my wand&#8217;ring ghost; <br />
Or with your navy seek the Velin coast, <br />
And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; <br />
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows, <br />
Without whose aid you durst not undertake <br />
This frightful passage o&#8217;er the Stygian lake, <br />
Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o&#8217;er <br />
To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.&#8221; <br />
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began: <br />
&#8220;What hopes delude thee, miserable man? <br />
Think&#8217;st thou, thus unintomb&#8217;d, to cross the floods, <br />
To view the Furies and infernal gods, <br />
And visit, without leave, the dark abodes? <br />
Attend the term of long revolving years; <br />
Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. <br />
This comfort of thy dire misfortune take: <br />
The wrath of Heav&#8217;n, inflicted for thy sake, <br />
With vengeance shall pursue th&#8217; inhuman coast, <br />
Till they propitiate thy offended ghost, <br />
And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray&#8217;r; <br />
And Palinurus&#8217; name the place shall bear.&#8221; <br />
This calm&#8217;d his cares; sooth&#8217;d with his future fame, <br />
And pleas&#8217;d to hear his propagated name. <br />
Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw: <br />
Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; <br />
Observ&#8217;d their passage thro&#8217; the shady wood, <br />
And mark&#8217;d their near approaches to the flood. <br />
Then thus he call&#8217;d aloud, inflam&#8217;d with wrath: <br />
&#8220;Mortal, whate&#8217;er, who this forbidden path <br />
In arms presum&#8217;st to tread, I charge thee, stand, <br />
And tell thy name, and bus&#8217;ness in the land. <br />
Know this, the realm of night&#8211;the Stygian shore: <br />
My boat conveys no living bodies o&#8217;er; <br />
Nor was I pleas&#8217;d great Theseus once to bear, <br />
Who forc&#8217;d a passage with his pointed spear, <br />
Nor strong Alcides&#8211;men of mighty fame, <br />
And from th&#8217; immortal gods their lineage came. <br />
In fetters one the barking porter tied, <br />
And took him trembling from his sov&#8217;reign&#8217;s side: <br />
Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.&#8221; <br />
To whom the Sibyl thus: &#8220;Compose thy mind; <br />
Nor frauds are here contriv&#8217;d, nor force design&#8217;d. <br />
Still may the dog the wand&#8217;ring troops constrain <br />
Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train, <br />
And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain. <br />
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove, <br />
Much fam&#8217;d for arms, and more for filial love, <br />
Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove. <br />
If neither piety, nor Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s command, <br />
Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand, <br />
This fatal present shall prevail at least.&#8221; <br />
Then shew&#8217;d the shining bough, conceal&#8217;d within her vest. <br />
No more was needful: for the gloomy god <br />
Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod; <br />
Admir&#8217;d the destin&#8217;d off&#8217;ring to his queen&#8211; <br />
A venerable gift, so rarely seen. <br />
His fury thus appeas&#8217;d, he puts to land; <br />
The ghosts forsake their seats at his command: <br />
He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight; <br />
The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. <br />
Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides; <br />
The pressing water pours within her sides. <br />
His passengers at length are wafted o&#8217;er, <br />
Expos&#8217;d, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore. <br />
No sooner landed, in his den they found <br />
The triple porter of the Stygian sound, <br />
Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear <br />
His crested snakes, and arm&#8217;d his bristling hair. <br />
The prudent Sibyl had before prepar&#8217;d <br />
A sop, in honey steep&#8217;d, to charm the guard; <br />
Which, mix&#8217;d with pow&#8217;rful drugs, she cast before <br />
His greedy grinning jaws, just op&#8217;d to roar. <br />
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, <br />
With hunger press&#8217;d, devours the pleasing bait. <br />
Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; <br />
He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. <br />
The keeper charm&#8217;d, the chief without delay <br />
Pass&#8217;d on, and took th&#8217; irremeable way. <br />
Before the gates, the cries of babes new born, <br />
Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn, <br />
Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws <br />
Condemn&#8217;d to die, when traitors judg&#8217;d their cause. <br />
Nor want they lots, nor judges to review <br />
The wrongful sentence, and award a new. <br />
Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; <br />
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. <br />
Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls, <br />
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. <br />
The next, in place and punishment, are they <br />
Who prodigally throw their souls away; <br />
Fools, who, repining at their wretched state, <br />
And loathing anxious life, suborn&#8217;d their fate. <br />
With late repentance now they would retrieve <br />
The bodies they forsook, and wish to live; <br />
Their pains and poverty desire to bear, <br />
To view the light of heav&#8217;n, and breathe the vital air: <br />
But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose, <br />
And with nine circling streams the captive souls inclose. <br />
Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear <br />
So call&#8217;d from lovers that inhabit there. <br />
The souls whom that unhappy flame invades, <br />
In secret solitude and myrtle shades <br />
Make endless moans, and, pining with desire, <br />
Lament too late their unextinguish&#8217;d fire. <br />
Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found, <br />
Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound <br />
Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there, <br />
With Phaedra&#8217;s ghost, a foul incestuous pair. <br />
There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves, <br />
Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves: <br />
Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man, <br />
But ending in the sex she first began. <br />
Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood, <br />
Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath&#8217;d in blood; <br />
Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew, <br />
obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view, <br />
(Doubtful as he who sees, thro&#8217; dusky night, <br />
Or thinks he sees, the moon&#8217;s uncertain light,) <br />
With tears he first approach&#8217;d the sullen shade; <br />
And, as his love inspir&#8217;d him, thus he said: <br />
&#8220;Unhappy queen! then is the common breath <br />
Of rumor true, in your reported death, <br />
And I, alas! the cause? By Heav&#8217;n, I vow, <br />
And all the pow&#8217;rs that rule the realms below, <br />
Unwilling I forsook your friendly state, <br />
Commanded by the gods, and forc&#8217;d by fate&#8211; <br />
Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might <br />
Have sent me to these regions void of light, <br />
Thro&#8217; the vast empire of eternal night. <br />
Nor dar&#8217;d I to presume, that, press&#8217;d with grief, <br />
My flight should urge you to this dire relief. <br />
Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows: <br />
&#8216;T is the last interview that fate allows!&#8221; <br />
In vain he thus attempts her mind to move <br />
With tears, and pray&#8217;rs, and late-repenting love. <br />
Disdainfully she look&#8217;d; then turning round, <br />
But fix&#8217;d her eyes unmov&#8217;d upon the ground, <br />
And what he says and swears, regards no more <br />
Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; <br />
But whirl&#8217;d away, to shun his hateful sight, <br />
Hid in the forest and the shades of night; <br />
Then sought Sichaeus thro&#8217; the shady grove, <br />
Who answer&#8217;d all her cares, and equal&#8217;d all her love. <br />
Some pious tears the pitying hero paid, <br />
And follow&#8217;d with his eyes the flitting shade, <br />
Then took the forward way, by fate ordain&#8217;d, <br />
And, with his guide, the farther fields attain&#8217;d, <br />
Where, sever&#8217;d from the rest, the warrior souls remain&#8217;d. <br />
Tydeus he met, with Meleager&#8217;s race, <br />
The pride of armies, and the soldiers&#8217; grace; <br />
And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face. <br />
Of Trojan chiefs he view&#8217;d a num&#8217;rous train, <br />
All much lamented, all in battle slain; <br />
Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest, <br />
Antenor&#8217;s sons, and Ceres&#8217; sacred priest. <br />
And proud Idaeus, Priam&#8217;s charioteer, <br />
Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. <br />
The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend <br />
And with unwearied eyes behold their friend; <br />
Delight to hover near, and long to know <br />
What bus&#8217;ness brought him to the realms below. <br />
But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon&#8217;s train, <br />
When his refulgent arms flash&#8217;d thro&#8217; the shady plain, <br />
Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear, <br />
As when his thund&#8217;ring sword and pointed spear <br />
Drove headlong to their ships, and glean&#8217;d the routed rear. <br />
They rais&#8217;d a feeble cry, with trembling notes; <br />
But the weak voice deceiv&#8217;d their gasping throats. <br />
Here Priam&#8217;s son, Deiphobus, he found, <br />
Whose face and limbs were one continued wound: <br />
Dishonest, with lopp&#8217;d arms, the youth appears, <br />
Spoil&#8217;d of his nose, and shorten&#8217;d of his ears. <br />
He scarcely knew him, striving to disown <br />
His blotted form, and blushing to be known; <br />
And therefore first began: &#8220;O Teucer&#8217;s race, <br />
Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface? <br />
What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace? <br />
&#8216;Twas fam&#8217;d, that in our last and fatal night <br />
Your single prowess long sustain&#8217;d the fight, <br />
Till tir&#8217;d, not forc&#8217;d, a glorious fate you chose, <br />
And fell upon a heap of slaughter&#8217;d foes. <br />
But, in remembrance of so brave a deed, <br />
A tomb and fun&#8217;ral honors I decreed; <br />
Thrice call&#8217;d your manes on the Trojan plains: <br />
The place your armor and your name retains. <br />
Your body too I sought, and, had I found, <br />
Design&#8217;d for burial in your native ground.&#8221; <br />
The ghost replied: &#8220;Your piety has paid <br />
All needful rites, to rest my wand&#8217;ring shade; <br />
But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife, <br />
To Grecian swords betray&#8217;d my sleeping life. <br />
These are the monuments of Helen&#8217;s love: <br />
The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. <br />
You know in what deluding joys we pass&#8217;d <br />
The night that was by Heav&#8217;n decreed our last: <br />
For, when the fatal horse, descending down, <br />
Pregnant with arms, o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d th&#8217; unhappy town <br />
She feign&#8217;d nocturnal orgies; left my bed, <br />
And, mix&#8217;d with Trojan dames, the dances led; <br />
Then, waving high her torch, the signal made, <br />
Which rous&#8217;d the Grecians from their ambuscade. <br />
With watching overworn, with cares oppress&#8217;d, <br />
Unhappy I had laid me down to rest, <br />
And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess&#8217;d. <br />
Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, <br />
And from beneath my head my sword convey&#8217;d; <br />
The door unlatch&#8217;d, and, with repeated calls, <br />
Invites her former lord within my walls. <br />
Thus in her crime her confidence she plac&#8217;d, <br />
And with new treasons would redeem the past. <br />
What need I more? Into the room they ran, <br />
And meanly murther&#8217;d a defenseless man. <br />
Ulysses, basely born, first led the way. <br />
Avenging pow&#8217;rs! with justice if I pray, <br />
That fortune be their own another day! <br />
But answer you; and in your turn relate, <br />
What brought you, living, to the Stygian state: <br />
Driv&#8217;n by the winds and errors of the sea, <br />
Or did you Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s superior doom obey? <br />
Or tell what other chance conducts your way, <br />
To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats, <br />
Tumults and torments of th&#8217; infernal seats.&#8221; <br />
While thus in talk the flying hours they pass, <br />
The sun had finish&#8217;d more than half his race: <br />
And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent <br />
The little time of stay which Heav&#8217;n had lent; <br />
But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay: <br />
&#8220;Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day: <br />
&#8216;T is here, in different paths, the way divides; <br />
The right to Pluto&#8217;s golden palace guides; <br />
The left to that unhappy region tends, <br />
Which to the depth of Tartarus descends; <br />
The seat of night profound, and punish&#8217;d fiends.&#8221; <br />
Then thus Deiphobus: &#8220;O sacred maid, <br />
Forbear to chide, and be your will obey&#8217;d! <br />
Lo! to the secret shadows I retire, <br />
To pay my penance till my years expire. <br />
Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown&#8217;d, <br />
And born to better fates than I have found.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn&#8217;d <br />
To secret shadows, and in silence mourn&#8217;d. <br />
The hero, looking on the left, espied <br />
A lofty tow&#8217;r, and strong on ev&#8217;ry side <br />
With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds, <br />
Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds; <br />
And, press&#8217;d betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds. <br />
Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais&#8217;d on high <br />
With adamantine columns, threats the sky. <br />
Vain is the force of man, and Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s as vain, <br />
To crush the pillars which the pile sustain. <br />
Sublime on these a tow&#8217;r of steel is rear&#8217;d; <br />
And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward, <br />
Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, <br />
Observant of the souls that pass the downward way. <br />
From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains <br />
Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains. <br />
The Trojan stood astonish&#8217;d at their cries, <br />
And ask&#8217;d his guide from whence those yells arise; <br />
And what the crimes, and what the tortures were, <br />
And loud laments that rent the liquid air. <br />
She thus replied; &#8220;The chaste and holy race <br />
Are all forbidden this polluted place. <br />
But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods, <br />
Then led me trembling thro&#8217; these dire abodes, <br />
And taught the tortures of th&#8217; avenging gods. <br />
These are the realms of unrelenting fate; <br />
And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state. <br />
He hears and judges each committed crime; <br />
Enquires into the manner, place, and time. <br />
The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal, <br />
(Loth to confess, unable to conceal), <br />
From the first moment of his vital breath, <br />
To his last hour of unrepenting death. <br />
Straight, o&#8217;er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes <br />
The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, <br />
And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. <br />
Then, of itself, unfolds th&#8217; eternal door; <br />
With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. <br />
You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost <br />
Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. <br />
More formidable Hydra stands within, <br />
Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. <br />
The gaping gulf low to the center lies, <br />
And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. <br />
The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, <br />
Here, sing&#8217;d with lightning, roll within th&#8217; unfathom&#8217;d space. <br />
Here lie th&#8217; Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) <br />
Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, <br />
Who dar&#8217;d in fight the Thund&#8217;rer to defy, <br />
Affect his heav&#8217;n, and force him from the sky. <br />
Salmoneus, suff&#8217;ring cruel pains, I found, <br />
For emulating Jove; the rattling sound <br />
Of mimic thunder, and the glitt&#8217;ring blaze <br />
Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. <br />
Thro&#8217; Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; <br />
Th&#8217; audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: <br />
He wav&#8217;d a torch aloft, and, madly vain, <br />
Sought godlike worship from a servile train. <br />
Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass <br />
O&#8217;er hollow arches of resounding brass, <br />
To rival thunder in its rapid course, <br />
And imitate inimitable force! <br />
But he, the King of Heav&#8217;n, obscure on high, <br />
Bar&#8217;d his red arm, and, launching from the sky <br />
His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, <br />
Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook. <br />
There Tityus was to see, who took his birth <br />
From heav&#8217;n, his nursing from the foodful earth. <br />
Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, <br />
Infold nine acres of infernal space. <br />
A rav&#8217;nous vulture, in his open&#8217;d side, <br />
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried; <br />
Still for the growing liver digg&#8217;d his breast; <br />
The growing liver still supplied the feast; <br />
Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains: <br />
Th&#8217; immortal hunger lasts, th&#8217; immortal food remains. <br />
Ixion and Perithous I could name, <br />
And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame. <br />
High o&#8217;er their heads a mold&#8217;ring rock is plac&#8217;d, <br />
That promises a fall, and shakes at ev&#8217;ry blast. <br />
They lie below, on golden beds display&#8217;d; <br />
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made. <br />
The Queen of Furies by their sides is set, <br />
And snatches from their mouths th&#8217; untasted meat, <br />
Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears, <br />
Tossing her torch, and thund&#8217;ring in their ears. <br />
Then they, who brothers&#8217; better claim disown, <br />
Expel their parents, and usurp the throne; <br />
Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, <br />
Sit brooding on unprofitable gold; <br />
Who dare not give, and ev&#8217;n refuse to lend <br />
To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend. <br />
Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train <br />
Of lustful youths, for foul adult&#8217;ry slain: <br />
Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold, <br />
And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold. <br />
All these within the dungeon&#8217;s depth remain, <br />
Despairing pardon, and expecting pain. <br />
Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know <br />
Their process, or the forms of law below. <br />
Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, <br />
And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung. <br />
Unhappy Theseus, doom&#8217;d for ever there, <br />
Is fix&#8217;d by fate on his eternal chair; <br />
And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries <br />
(Could warning make the world more just or wise): <br />
&#8216;Learn righteousness, and dread th&#8217; avenging deities.&#8217; <br />
To tyrants others have their country sold, <br />
Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; <br />
Some have old laws repeal&#8217;d, new statutes made, <br />
Not as the people pleas&#8217;d, but as they paid; <br />
With incest some their daughters&#8217; bed profan&#8217;d: <br />
All dar&#8217;d the worst of ills, and, what they dar&#8217;d, attain&#8217;d. <br />
Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, <br />
And throats of brass, inspir&#8217;d with iron lungs, <br />
I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, <br />
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. <br />
But let us haste our voyage to pursue: <br />
The walls of Pluto&#8217;s palace are in view; <br />
The gate, and iron arch above it, stands <br />
On anvils labor&#8217;d by the Cyclops&#8217; hands. <br />
Before our farther way the Fates allow, <br />
Here must we fix on high the golden bough.&#8221; <br />
She said: and thro&#8217; the gloomy shades they pass&#8217;d, <br />
And chose the middle path. Arriv&#8217;d at last, <br />
The prince with living water sprinkled o&#8217;er <br />
His limbs and body; then approach&#8217;d the door, <br />
Possess&#8217;d the porch, and on the front above <br />
He fix&#8217;d the fatal bough requir&#8217;d by Pluto&#8217;s love. <br />
These holy rites perform&#8217;d, they took their way <br />
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay: <br />
The verdant fields with those of heav&#8217;n may vie, <br />
With ether vested, and a purple sky; <br />
The blissful seats of happy souls below. <br />
Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know; <br />
Their airy limbs in sports they exercise, <br />
And on the green contend the wrestler&#8217;s prize. <br />
Some in heroic verse divinely sing; <br />
Others in artful measures lead the ring. <br />
The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest, <br />
There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest; <br />
His flying fingers, and harmonious quill, <br />
Strikes sev&#8217;n distinguish&#8217;d notes, and sev&#8217;n at once they fill. <br />
Here found they Teucer&#8217;s old heroic race, <br />
Born better times and happier years to grace. <br />
Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy <br />
Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy. <br />
The chief beheld their chariots from afar, <br />
Their shining arms, and coursers train&#8217;d to war: <br />
Their lances fix&#8217;d in earth, their steeds around, <br />
Free from their harness, graze the flow&#8217;ry ground. <br />
The love of horses which they had, alive, <br />
And care of chariots, after death survive. <br />
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain; <br />
Some did the song, and some the choir maintain, <br />
Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po <br />
Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. <br />
Here patriots live, who, for their country&#8217;s good, <br />
In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood: <br />
Priests of unblemish&#8217;d lives here make abode, <br />
And poets worthy their inspiring god; <br />
And searching wits, of more mechanic parts, <br />
Who grac&#8217;d their age with new-invented arts: <br />
Those who to worth their bounty did extend, <br />
And those who knew that bounty to commend. <br />
The heads of these with holy fillets bound, <br />
And all their temples were with garlands crown&#8217;d. <br />
To these the Sibyl thus her speech address&#8217;d, <br />
And first to him surrounded by the rest <br />
(Tow&#8217;ring his height, and ample was his breast): <br />
&#8220;Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say, <br />
Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way <br />
To find the hero, for whose only sake <br />
We sought the dark abodes, and cross&#8217;d the bitter lake?&#8221; <br />
To this the sacred poet thus replied: <br />
&#8220;In no fix&#8217;d place the happy souls reside. <br />
In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, <br />
By crystal streams, that murmur thro&#8217; the meads: <br />
But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; <br />
The path conducts you to your journey&#8217;s end.&#8221; <br />
This said, he led them up the mountain&#8217;s brow, <br />
And shews them all the shining fields below. <br />
They wind the hill, and thro&#8217; the blissful meadows go. <br />
But old Anchises, in a flow&#8217;ry vale, <br />
Review&#8217;d his muster&#8217;d race, and took the tale: <br />
Those happy spirits, which, ordain&#8217;d by fate, <br />
For future beings and new bodies wait&#8211; <br />
With studious thought observ&#8217;d th&#8217; illustrious throng, <br />
In nature&#8217;s order as they pass&#8217;d along: <br />
Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, <br />
In peaceful senates and successful war. <br />
He, when AEneas on the plain appears, <br />
Meets him with open arms, and falling tears. <br />
&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the gods&#8217; undoubted race! <br />
O long expected to my dear embrace! <br />
Once more &#8216;t is giv&#8217;n me to behold your face! <br />
The love and pious duty which you pay <br />
Have pass&#8217;d the perils of so hard a way. <br />
&#8216;T is true, computing times, I now believ&#8217;d <br />
The happy day approach&#8217;d; nor are my hopes deceiv&#8217;d. <br />
What length of lands, what oceans have you pass&#8217;d; <br />
What storms sustain&#8217;d, and on what shores been cast? <br />
How have I fear&#8217;d your fate! but fear&#8217;d it most, <br />
When love assail&#8217;d you, on the Libyan coast.&#8221; <br />
To this, the filial duty thus replies: <br />
&#8220;Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes <br />
Appear&#8217;d, and often urg&#8217;d this painful enterprise. <br />
After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea, <br />
My navy rides at anchor in the bay. <br />
But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun <br />
The dear embraces of your longing son!&#8221; <br />
He said; and falling tears his face bedew: <br />
Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw; <br />
And thrice the flitting shadow slipp&#8217;d away, <br />
Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day. <br />
Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees <br />
A sep&#8217;rate grove, thro&#8217; which a gentle breeze <br />
Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro&#8217; the trees; <br />
And, just before the confines of the wood, <br />
The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood. <br />
About the boughs an airy nation flew, <br />
Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew; <br />
In summer&#8217;s heat on tops of lilies feed, <br />
And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed: <br />
The winged army roams the fields around; <br />
The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound. <br />
AEneas wond&#8217;ring stood, then ask&#8217;d the cause <br />
Which to the stream the crowding people draws. <br />
Then thus the sire: &#8220;The souls that throng the flood <br />
Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow&#8217;d: <br />
In Lethe&#8217;s lake they long oblivion taste, <br />
Of future life secure, forgetful of the past. <br />
Long has my soul desir&#8217;d this time and place, <br />
To set before your sight your glorious race, <br />
That this presaging joy may fire your mind <br />
To seek the shores by destiny design&#8217;d.&#8221;&#8211; <br />
&#8220;O father, can it be, that souls sublime <br />
Return to visit our terrestrial clime, <br />
And that the gen&#8217;rous mind, releas&#8217;d by death, <br />
Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?&#8221; <br />
Anchises then, in order, thus begun <br />
To clear those wonders to his godlike son: <br />
&#8220;Know, first, that heav&#8217;n, and earth&#8217;s compacted frame, <br />
And flowing waters, and the starry flame, <br />
And both the radiant lights, one common soul <br />
Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole. <br />
This active mind, infus&#8217;d thro&#8217; all the space, <br />
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass. <br />
Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain, <br />
And birds of air, and monsters of the main. <br />
Th&#8217; ethereal vigor is in all the same, <br />
And every soul is fill&#8217;d with equal flame; <br />
As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay <br />
Of mortal members, subject to decay, <br />
Blunt not the beams of heav&#8217;n and edge of day. <br />
From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts, <br />
Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts, <br />
And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind, <br />
In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin&#8217;d, <br />
Assert the native skies, or own its heav&#8217;nly kind: <br />
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains; <br />
But long-contracted filth ev&#8217;n in the soul remains. <br />
The relics of inveterate vice they wear, <br />
And spots of sin obscene in ev&#8217;ry face appear. <br />
For this are various penances enjoin&#8217;d; <br />
And some are hung to bleach upon the wind, <br />
Some plung&#8217;d in waters, others purg&#8217;d in fires, <br />
Till all the dregs are drain&#8217;d, and all the rust expires. <br />
All have their manes, and those manes bear: <br />
The few, so cleans&#8217;d, to these abodes repair, <br />
And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air. <br />
Then are they happy, when by length of time <br />
The scurf is worn away of each committed crime; <br />
No speck is left of their habitual stains, <br />
But the pure ether of the soul remains. <br />
But, when a thousand rolling years are past, <br />
(So long their punishments and penance last,) <br />
Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god, <br />
Compell&#8217;d to drink the deep Lethaean flood, <br />
In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares <br />
Of their past labors, and their irksome years, <br />
That, unrememb&#8217;ring of its former pain, <br />
The soul may suffer mortal flesh again.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, the father spirit leads <br />
The priestess and his son thro&#8217; swarms of shades, <br />
And takes a rising ground, from thence to see <br />
The long procession of his progeny. <br />
&#8220;Survey,&#8221; pursued the sire, &#8220;this airy throng, <br />
As, offer&#8217;d to thy view, they pass along. <br />
These are th&#8217; Italian names, which fate will join <br />
With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line. <br />
Observe the youth who first appears in sight, <br />
And holds the nearest station to the light, <br />
Already seems to snuff the vital air, <br />
And leans just forward, on a shining spear: <br />
Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race, <br />
But first in order sent, to fill thy place; <br />
An Alban name, but mix&#8217;d with Dardan blood, <br />
Born in the covert of a shady wood: <br />
Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife, <br />
Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life. <br />
In Alba he shall fix his royal seat, <br />
And, born a king, a race of kings beget. <br />
Then Procas, honor of the Trojan name, <br />
Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame. <br />
A second Silvius after these appears; <br />
Silvius AEneas, for thy name he bears; <br />
For arms and justice equally renown&#8217;d, <br />
Who, late restor&#8217;d, in Alba shall be crown&#8217;d. <br />
How great they look! how vig&#8217;rously they wield <br />
Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield! <br />
But they, who crown&#8217;d with oaken wreaths appear, <br />
Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear; <br />
Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found; <br />
And raise Collatian tow&#8217;rs on rocky ground. <br />
All these shall then be towns of mighty fame, <br />
Tho&#8217; now they lie obscure, and lands without a name. <br />
See Romulus the great, born to restore <br />
The crown that once his injur&#8217;d grandsire wore. <br />
This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear, <br />
And like his sire in arms he shall appear. <br />
Two rising crests his royal head adorn; <br />
Born from a god, himself to godhead born: <br />
His sire already signs him for the skies, <br />
And marks the seat amidst the deities. <br />
Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come, <br />
Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome&#8211; <br />
Rome, whose ascending tow&#8217;rs shall heav&#8217;n invade, <br />
Involving earth and ocean in her shade; <br />
High as the Mother of the Gods in place, <br />
And proud, like her, of an immortal race. <br />
Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round, <br />
With golden turrets on her temples crown&#8217;d; <br />
A hundred gods her sweeping train supply; <br />
Her offspring all, and all command the sky. <br />
&#8220;Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see <br />
Your Roman race, and Julian progeny. <br />
The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour, <br />
Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis&#8217;d pow&#8217;r. <br />
But next behold the youth of form divine, <br />
Ceasar himself, exalted in his line; <br />
Augustus, promis&#8217;d oft, and long foretold, <br />
Sent to the realm that Saturn rul&#8217;d of old; <br />
Born to restore a better age of gold. <br />
Afric and India shall his pow&#8217;r obey; <br />
He shall extend his propagated sway <br />
Beyond the solar year, without the starry way, <br />
Where Atlas turns the rolling heav&#8217;ns around, <br />
And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown&#8217;d. <br />
At his foreseen approach, already quake <br />
The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake: <br />
Their seers behold the tempest from afar, <br />
And threat&#8217;ning oracles denounce the war. <br />
Nile hears him knocking at his sev&#8217;nfold gates, <br />
And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew&#8217;s fates. <br />
Nor Hercules more lands or labors knew, <br />
Not tho&#8217; the brazen-footed hind he slew, <br />
Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar, <br />
And dipp&#8217;d his arrows in Lernaean gore; <br />
Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war, <br />
By tigers drawn triumphant in his car, <br />
From Nisus&#8217; top descending on the plains, <br />
With curling vines around his purple reins. <br />
And doubt we yet thro&#8217; dangers to pursue <br />
The paths of honor, and a crown in view? <br />
But what&#8217;s the man, who from afar appears? <br />
His head with olive crown&#8217;d, his hand a censer bears, <br />
His hoary beard and holy vestments bring <br />
His lost idea back: I know the Roman king. <br />
He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain, <br />
Call&#8217;d from his mean abode a scepter to sustain. <br />
Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds, <br />
An active prince, and prone to martial deeds. <br />
He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare, <br />
Disus&#8217;d to toils, and triumphs of the war. <br />
By dint of sword his crown he shall increase, <br />
And scour his armor from the rust of peace. <br />
Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air, <br />
But vain within, and proudly popular. <br />
Next view the Tarquin kings, th&#8217; avenging sword <br />
Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor&#8217;d. <br />
He first renews the rods and ax severe, <br />
And gives the consuls royal robes to wear. <br />
His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain, <br />
And long for arbitrary lords again, <br />
With ignominy scourg&#8217;d, in open sight, <br />
He dooms to death deserv&#8217;d, asserting public right. <br />
Unhappy man, to break the pious laws <br />
Of nature, pleading in his children&#8217;s cause! <br />
Howe&#8217;er the doubtful fact is understood, <br />
&#8216;Tis love of honor, and his country&#8217;s good: <br />
The consul, not the father, sheds the blood. <br />
Behold Torquatus the same track pursue; <br />
And, next, the two devoted Decii view: <br />
The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home <br />
With standards well redeem&#8217;d, and foreign foes o&#8217;ercome. <br />
The pair you see in equal armor shine, <br />
Now, friends below, in close embraces join; <br />
But, when they leave the shady realms of night, <br />
And, cloth&#8217;d in bodies, breathe your upper light, <br />
With mortal hate each other shall pursue: <br />
What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue! <br />
From Alpine heights the father first descends; <br />
His daughter&#8217;s husband in the plain attends: <br />
His daughter&#8217;s husband arms his eastern friends. <br />
Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more; <br />
Nor stain your country with her children&#8217;s gore! <br />
And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, <br />
Thou, of my blood, who bear&#8217;st the Julian name! <br />
Another comes, who shall in triumph ride, <br />
And to the Capitol his chariot guide, <br />
From conquer&#8217;d Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils. <br />
And yet another, fam&#8217;d for warlike toils, <br />
On Argos shall impose the Roman laws, <br />
And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause; <br />
Shall drag in chains their Achillean race; <br />
Shall vindicate his ancestors&#8217; disgrace, <br />
And Pallas, for her violated place. <br />
Great Cato there, for gravity renown&#8217;d, <br />
And conqu&#8217;ring Cossus goes with laurels crown&#8217;d. <br />
Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare <br />
The Scipios&#8217; worth, those thunderbolts of war, <br />
The double bane of Carthage? Who can see <br />
Without esteem for virtuous poverty, <br />
Severe Fabricius, or can cease t&#8217; admire <br />
The plowman consul in his coarse attire? <br />
Tir&#8217;d as I am, my praise the Fabii claim; <br />
And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name, <br />
Ordain&#8217;d in war to save the sinking state, <br />
And, by delays, to put a stop to fate! <br />
Let others better mold the running mass <br />
Of metals, and inform the breathing brass, <br />
And soften into flesh a marble face; <br />
Plead better at the bar; describe the skies, <br />
And when the stars descend, and when they rise. <br />
But, Rome, &#8216;t is thine alone, with awful sway, <br />
To rule mankind, and make the world obey, <br />
Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way; <br />
To tame the proud, the fetter&#8217;d slave to free: <br />
These are imperial arts, and worthy thee.&#8221; <br />
He paus&#8217;d; and, while with wond&#8217;ring eyes they view&#8217;d <br />
The passing spirits, thus his speech renew&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;See great Marcellus! how, untir&#8217;d in toils, <br />
He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils! <br />
He, when his country, threaten&#8217;d with alarms, <br />
Requires his courage and his conqu&#8217;ring arms, <br />
Shall more than once the Punic bands affright; <br />
Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight; <br />
Then to the Capitol in triumph move, <br />
And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove.&#8221; <br />
AEneas here beheld, of form divine, <br />
A godlike youth in glitt&#8217;ring armor shine, <br />
With great Marcellus keeping equal pace; <br />
But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face. <br />
He saw, and, wond&#8217;ring, ask&#8217;d his airy guide, <br />
What and of whence was he, who press&#8217;d the hero&#8217;s side: <br />
&#8220;His son, or one of his illustrious name? <br />
How like the former, and almost the same! <br />
Observe the crowds that compass him around; <br />
All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound: <br />
But hov&#8217;ring mists around his brows are spread, <br />
And night, with sable shades, involves his head.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Seek not to know,&#8221; the ghost replied with tears, <br />
&#8220;The sorrows of thy sons in future years. <br />
This youth (the blissful vision of a day) <br />
Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch&#8217;d away. <br />
The gods too high had rais&#8217;d the Roman state, <br />
Were but their gifts as permanent as great. <br />
What groans of men shall fill the Martian field! <br />
How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! <br />
What fun&#8217;ral pomp shall floating Tiber see, <br />
When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity! <br />
No youth shall equal hopes of glory give, <br />
No youth afford so great a cause to grieve; <br />
The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast, <br />
Admir&#8217;d when living, and ador&#8217;d when lost! <br />
Mirror of ancient faith in early youth! <br />
Undaunted worth, inviolable truth! <br />
No foe, unpunish&#8217;d, in the fighting field <br />
Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield; <br />
Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force, <br />
When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. <br />
Ah! couldst thou break thro&#8217; fate&#8217;s severe decree, <br />
A new Marcellus shall arise in thee! <br />
Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the purple roses of the spring; <br />
Let me with fun&#8217;ral flow&#8217;rs his body strow; <br />
This gift which parents to their children owe, <br />
This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, he led the hero round <br />
The confines of the blest Elysian ground; <br />
Which when Anchises to his son had shown, <br />
And fir&#8217;d his mind to mount the promis&#8217;d throne, <br />
He tells the future wars, ordain&#8217;d by fate; <br />
The strength and customs of the Latian state; <br />
The prince, and people; and forearms his care <br />
With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear. <br />
Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn; <br />
Of polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry this, that of transparent horn: <br />
True visions thro&#8217; transparent horn arise; <br />
Thro&#8217; polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry pass deluding lies. <br />
Of various things discoursing as he pass&#8217;d, <br />
Anchises hither bends his steps at last. <br />
Then, thro&#8217; the gate of iv&#8217;ry, he dismiss&#8217;d <br />
His valiant offspring and divining guest. <br />
Straight to the ships AEneas took his way, <br />
Embark&#8217;d his men, and skimm&#8217;d along the sea, <br />
Still coasting, till he gain&#8217;d Cajeta&#8217;s bay. <br />
At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; <br />
Their heads are turn&#8217;d to sea, their sterns to shore.</p>
