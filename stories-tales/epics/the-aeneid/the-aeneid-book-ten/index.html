				<p>THE TENTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids<br />
them to engage in either party. At AEneas&#8217;s return there is a<br />
bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; AEneas, Lausus and Mezentius.<br />
Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausas as a pious and virtu-<br />
ous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the<br />
subject of a noble episode.</p>
<p>THE gates of heav&#8217;n unfold: Jove summons all <br />
The gods to council in the common hall. <br />
Sublimely seated, he surveys from far <br />
The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, <br />
And all th&#8217; inferior world. From first to last, <br />
The sov&#8217;reign senate in degrees are plac&#8217;d. <br />
Then thus th&#8217; almighty sire began: &#8220;Ye gods, <br />
Natives or denizens of blest abodes, <br />
From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, <br />
This backward fate from what was first design&#8217;d? <br />
Why this protracted war, when my commands <br />
Pronounc&#8217;d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? <br />
What fear or hope on either part divides <br />
Our heav&#8217;ns, and arms our powers on diff&#8217;rent sides? <br />
A lawful time of war at length will come, <br />
(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), <br />
When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, <br />
Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, <br />
And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. <br />
Then is your time for faction and debate, <br />
For partial favor, and permitted hate. <br />
Let now your immature dissension cease; <br />
Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.&#8221; <br />
Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; <br />
But lovely Venus thus replies at large: <br />
&#8220;O pow&#8217;r immense, eternal energy, <br />
(For to what else protection can we fly?) <br />
Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare <br />
In fields, unpunish&#8217;d, and insult my care? <br />
How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train, <br />
In shining arms, triumphant on the plain? <br />
Ev&#8217;n in their lines and trenches they contend, <br />
And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend: <br />
The town is fill&#8217;d with slaughter, and o&#8217;erfloats, <br />
With a red deluge, their increasing moats. <br />
AEneas, ignorant, and far from thence, <br />
Has left a camp expos&#8217;d, without defense. <br />
This endless outrage shall they still sustain? <br />
Shall Troy renew&#8217;d be forc&#8217;d and fir&#8217;d again? <br />
A second siege my banish&#8217;d issue fears, <br />
And a new Diomede in arms appears. <br />
One more audacious mortal will be found; <br />
And I, thy daughter, wait another wound. <br />
Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave, <br />
The Latian lands my progeny receive, <br />
Bear they the pains of violated law, <br />
And thy protection from their aid withdraw. <br />
But, if the gods their sure success foretell; <br />
If those of heav&#8217;n consent with those of hell, <br />
To promise Italy; who dare debate <br />
The pow&#8217;r of Jove, or fix another fate? <br />
What should I tell of tempests on the main, <br />
Of AEolus usurping Neptune&#8217;s reign? <br />
Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat <br />
T&#8217; inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet? <br />
Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends, <br />
Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends. <br />
That new example wanted yet above: <br />
An act that well became the wife of Jove! <br />
Alecto, rais&#8217;d by her, with rage inflames <br />
The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames. <br />
Imperial sway no more exalts my mind; <br />
(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav&#8217;n was kind;) <br />
Now let my happier foes possess my place, <br />
Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; <br />
And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. <br />
Since you can spare, from all your wide command, <br />
No spot of earth, no hospitable land, <br />
Which may my wand&#8217;ring fugitives receive; <br />
(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) <br />
Then, father, (if I still may use that name,) <br />
By ruin&#8217;d Troy, yet smoking from the flame, <br />
I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, <br />
Be freed from danger, and dismiss&#8217;d the war: <br />
Inglorious let him live, without a crown. <br />
The father may be cast on coasts unknown, <br />
Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. <br />
Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow&#8217;rs: <br />
In those recesses, and those sacred bow&#8217;rs, <br />
Obscurely let him rest; his right resign <br />
To promis&#8217;d empire, and his Julian line. <br />
Then Carthage may th&#8217; Ausonian towns destroy, <br />
Nor fear the race of a rejected boy. <br />
What profits it my son to scape the fire, <br />
Arm&#8217;d with his gods, and loaded with his sire; <br />
To pass the perils of the seas and wind; <br />
Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; <br />
To reach th&#8217; Italian shores; if, after all, <br />
Our second Pergamus is doom&#8217;d to fall? <br />
Much better had he curb&#8217;d his high desires, <br />
And hover&#8217;d o&#8217;er his ill-extinguish&#8217;d fires. <br />
To Simois&#8217; banks the fugitives restore, <br />
And give them back to war, and all the woes before.&#8221; <br />
Deep indignation swell&#8217;d Saturnia&#8217;s heart: <br />
&#8220;And must I own,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my secret smart&#8211; <br />
What with more decence were in silence kept, <br />
And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept? <br />
Did god or man your fav&#8217;rite son advise, <br />
With war unhop&#8217;d the Latians to surprise? <br />
By fate, you boast, and by the gods&#8217; decree, <br />
He left his native land for Italy! <br />
Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more <br />
Than Heav&#8217;n inspir&#8217;d, he sought a foreign shore! <br />
Did I persuade to trust his second Troy <br />
To the raw conduct of a beardless boy, <br />
With walls unfinish&#8217;d, which himself forsakes, <br />
And thro&#8217; the waves a wand&#8217;ring voyage takes? <br />
When have I urg&#8217;d him meanly to demand <br />
The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land? <br />
Did I or Iris give this mad advice, <br />
Or made the fool himself the fatal choice? <br />
You think it hard, the Latians should destroy <br />
With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! <br />
Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw <br />
Their native air, nor take a foreign law! <br />
That Turnus is permitted still to live, <br />
To whom his birth a god and goddess give! <br />
But yet &#8216;t is just and lawful for your line <br />
To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; <br />
Realms, not your own, among your clans divide, <br />
And from the bridegroom tear the promis&#8217;d bride; <br />
Petition, while you public arms prepare; <br />
Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war! <br />
&#8216;T was giv&#8217;n to you, your darling son to shroud, <br />
To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd, <br />
And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. <br />
From flaming fleets you turn&#8217;d the fire away, <br />
And chang&#8217;d the ships to daughters of the sea. <br />
But &#8216;t is my crime&#8211;the Queen of Heav&#8217;n offends, <br />
If she presume to save her suff&#8217;ring friends! <br />
Your son, not knowing what his foes decree, <br />
You say, is absent: absent let him be. <br />
Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow&#8217;rs, <br />
The soft recesses, and the sacred bow&#8217;rs. <br />
Why do you then these needless arms prepare, <br />
And thus provoke a people prone to war? <br />
Did I with fire the Trojan town deface, <br />
Or hinder from return your exil&#8217;d race? <br />
Was I the cause of mischief, or the man <br />
Whose lawless lust the fatal war began? <br />
Think on whose faith th&#8217; adult&#8217;rous youth relied; <br />
Who promis&#8217;d, who procur&#8217;d, the Spartan bride? <br />
When all th&#8217; united states of Greece combin&#8217;d, <br />
To purge the world of the perfidious kind, <br />
Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate: <br />
Your quarrels and complaints are now too late.&#8221; <br />
Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix&#8217;d applause, <br />
Just as they favor or dislike the cause. <br />
So winds, when yet unfledg&#8217;d in woods they lie, <br />
In whispers first their tender voices try, <br />
Then issue on the main with bellowing rage, <br />
And storms to trembling mariners presage. <br />
Then thus to both replied th&#8217; imperial god, <br />
Who shakes heav&#8217;n&#8217;s axles with his awful nod. <br />
(When he begins, the silent senate stand <br />
With rev&#8217;rence, list&#8217;ning to the dread command: <br />
The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain; <br />
And the hush&#8217;d waves lie flatted on the main.) <br />
&#8220;Celestials, your attentive ears incline! <br />
Since,&#8221; said the god, &#8220;the Trojans must not join <br />
In wish&#8217;d alliance with the Latian line; <br />
Since endless jarrings and immortal hate <br />
Tend but to discompose our happy state; <br />
The war henceforward be resign&#8217;d to fate: <br />
Each to his proper fortune stand or fall; <br />
Equal and unconcern&#8217;d I look on all. <br />
Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; <br />
And both shall draw the lots their fates decree. <br />
Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend; <br />
And, if she favors those, let those defend: <br />
The Fates will find their way.&#8221; The Thund&#8217;rer said, <br />
And shook the sacred honors of his head, <br />
Attesting Styx, th&#8217; inviolable flood, <br />
And the black regions of his brother god. <br />
Trembled the poles of heav&#8217;n, and earth confess&#8217;d the nod. <br />
This end the sessions had: the senate rise, <br />
And to his palace wait their sov&#8217;reign thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes <br />
Within their walls the Trojan host inclose: <br />
They wound, they kill, they watch at ev&#8217;ry gate; <br />
Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate. <br />
Th&#8217; AEneans wish in vain their wanted chief, <br />
Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. <br />
Thin on the tow&#8217;rs they stand; and ev&#8217;n those few <br />
A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. <br />
Yet in the face of danger some there stood: <br />
The two bold brothers of Sarpedon&#8217;s blood, <br />
Asius and Acmon; both th&#8217; Assaraci; <br />
Young Haemon, and tho&#8217; young, resolv&#8217;d to die. <br />
With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join&#8217;d; <br />
Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. <br />
From Acmon&#8217;s hands a rolling stone there came, <br />
So large, it half deserv&#8217;d a mountain&#8217;s name: <br />
Strong-sinew&#8217;d was the youth, and big of bone; <br />
His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, <br />
Or the great father of th&#8217; intrepid son. <br />
Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; <br />
And some with darts, and some with stones defend. <br />
Amid the press appears the beauteous boy, <br />
The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. <br />
His lovely face unarm&#8217;d, his head was bare; <br />
In ringlets o&#8217;er his shoulders hung his hair. <br />
His forehead circled with a diadem; <br />
Distinguish&#8217;d from the crowd, he shines a gem, <br />
Enchas&#8217;d in gold, or polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry set, <br />
Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. <br />
Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war, <br />
Directing pointed arrows from afar, <br />
And death with poison arm&#8217;d&#8211;in Lydia born, <br />
Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; <br />
Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, <br />
And leaves a rich manure of golden sands. <br />
There Capys, author of the Capuan name, <br />
And there was Mnestheus too, increas&#8217;d in fame, <br />
Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. <br />
Thus mortal war was wag&#8217;d on either side. <br />
Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: <br />
For, anxious, from Evander when he went, <br />
He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon&#8217;s tent; <br />
Expos&#8217;d the cause of coming to the chief; <br />
His name and country told, and ask&#8217;d relief; <br />
Propos&#8217;d the terms; his own small strength declar&#8217;d; <br />
What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar&#8217;d: <br />
What Turnus, bold and violent, design&#8217;d; <br />
Then shew&#8217;d the slipp&#8217;ry state of humankind, <br />
And fickle fortune; warn&#8217;d him to beware, <br />
And to his wholesome counsel added pray&#8217;r. <br />
Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, <br />
And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins. <br />
They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand; <br />
Their forces trusted with a foreign hand. <br />
AEneas leads; upon his stern appear <br />
Two lions carv&#8217;d, which rising Ida bear&#8211; <br />
Ida, to wand&#8217;ring Trojans ever dear. <br />
Under their grateful shade AEneas sate, <br />
Revolving war&#8217;s events, and various fate. <br />
His left young Pallas kept, fix&#8217;d to his side, <br />
And oft of winds enquir&#8217;d, and of the tide; <br />
Oft of the stars, and of their wat&#8217;ry way; <br />
And what he suffer&#8217;d both by land and sea. <br />
Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! <br />
The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, <br />
Which follow&#8217;d great AEneas to the war: <br />
Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. <br />
A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, <br />
Borne in the Tiger thro&#8217; the foaming sea; <br />
From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: <br />
For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. <br />
Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore; <br />
His stern Apollo&#8217;s golden statue bore. <br />
Six hundred Populonia sent along, <br />
All skill&#8217;d in martial exercise, and strong. <br />
Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, <br />
An isle renown&#8217;d for steel, and unexhausted mines. <br />
Asylas on his prow the third appears, <br />
Who heav&#8217;n interprets, and the wand&#8217;ring stars; <br />
From offer&#8217;d entrails prodigies expounds, <br />
And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. <br />
A thousand spears in warlike order stand, <br />
Sent by the Pisans under his command. <br />
Fair Astur follows in the wat&#8217;ry field, <br />
Proud of his manag&#8217;d horse and painted shield. <br />
Gravisca, noisome from the neighb&#8217;ring fen, <br />
And his own Caere, sent three hundred men; <br />
With those which Minio&#8217;s fields and Pyrgi gave, <br />
All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. <br />
Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew, <br />
And brave Cupavo follow&#8217;d but by few; <br />
Whose helm confess&#8217;d the lineage of the man, <br />
And bore, with wings display&#8217;d, a silver swan. <br />
Love was the fault of his fam&#8217;d ancestry, <br />
Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly. <br />
For Cycnus lov&#8217;d unhappy Phaeton, <br />
And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone, <br />
Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief. <br />
Heav&#8217;n heard his song, and hasten&#8217;d his relief, <br />
And chang&#8217;d to snowy plumes his hoary hair, <br />
And wing&#8217;d his flight, to chant aloft in air. <br />
His son Cupavo brush&#8217;d the briny flood: <br />
Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood, <br />
Who heav&#8217;d a rock, and, threat&#8217;ning still to throw, <br />
With lifted hands alarm&#8217;d the seas below: <br />
They seem&#8217;d to fear the formidable sight, <br />
And roll&#8217;d their billows on, to speed his flight. <br />
Ocnus was next, who led his native train <br />
Of hardy warriors thro&#8217; the wat&#8217;ry plain: <br />
The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream, <br />
From whence the Mantuan town derives the name&#8211; <br />
An ancient city, but of mix&#8217;d descent: <br />
Three sev&#8217;ral tribes compose the government; <br />
Four towns are under each; but all obey <br />
The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway. <br />
Hate to Mezentius arm&#8217;d five hundred more, <br />
Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore: <br />
Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er. <br />
These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep <br />
With stretching oars at once the glassy deep. <br />
Him and his martial train the Triton bears; <br />
High on his poop the sea-green god appears: <br />
Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound, <br />
And at the blast the billows dance around. <br />
A hairy man above the waist he shows; <br />
A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; <br />
And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, <br />
And froth and foam augment the murm&#8217;ring tides. <br />
Full thirty ships transport the chosen train <br />
For Troy&#8217;s relief, and scour the briny main. <br />
Now was the world forsaken by the sun, <br />
And Phoebe half her nightly race had run. <br />
The careful chief, who never clos&#8217;d his eyes, <br />
Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. <br />
A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood, <br />
Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida&#8217;s wood; <br />
But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep, <br />
As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. <br />
They know him from afar; and in a ring <br />
Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. <br />
Cymodoce, whose voice excell&#8217;d the rest, <br />
Above the waves advanc&#8217;d her snowy breast; <br />
Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides <br />
The curling ocean, and corrects the tides. <br />
She spoke for all the choir, and thus began <br />
With pleasing words to warn th&#8217; unknowing man: <br />
&#8220;Sleeps our lov&#8217;d lord? O goddess-born, awake! <br />
Spread ev&#8217;ry sail, pursue your wat&#8217;ry track, <br />
And haste your course. Your navy once were we, <br />
From Ida&#8217;s height descending to the sea; <br />
Till Turnus, as at anchor fix&#8217;d we stood, <br />
Presum&#8217;d to violate our holy wood. <br />
Then, loos&#8217;d from shore, we fled his fires profane <br />
(Unwillingly we broke our master&#8217;s chain), <br />
And since have sought you thro&#8217; the Tuscan main. <br />
The mighty Mother chang&#8217;d our forms to these, <br />
And gave us life immortal in the seas. <br />
But young Ascanius, in his camp distress&#8217;d, <br />
By your insulting foes is hardly press&#8217;d. <br />
Th&#8217; Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, <br />
Advance in order on the Latian coast: <br />
To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, <br />
Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. <br />
Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, <br />
First arm thy soldiers for th&#8217; ensuing fight: <br />
Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, <br />
And bear aloft th&#8217; impenetrable shield. <br />
To-morrow&#8217;s sun, unless my skill be vain, <br />
Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.&#8221; <br />
Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force <br />
Push&#8217;d on the vessel in her wat&#8217;ry course; <br />
For well she knew the way. Impell&#8217;d behind, <br />
The ship flew forward, and outstripp&#8217;d the wind. <br />
The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, <br />
The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. <br />
Then thus he pray&#8217;d, and fix&#8217;d on heav&#8217;n his eyes: <br />
&#8220;Hear thou, great Mother of the deities. <br />
With turrets crown&#8217;d! (on Ida&#8217;s holy hill <br />
Fierce tigers, rein&#8217;d and curb&#8217;d, obey thy will.) <br />
Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; <br />
And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.&#8221; <br />
He said no more. And now renewing day <br />
Had chas&#8217;d the shadows of the night away. <br />
He charg&#8217;d the soldiers, with preventing care, <br />
Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare; <br />
Warn&#8217;d of th&#8217; ensuing fight, and bade &#8216;em hope the war. <br />
Now, from his lofty poop, he view&#8217;d below <br />
His camp incompass&#8217;d, and th&#8217; inclosing foe. <br />
His blazing shield, imbrac&#8217;d, he held on high; <br />
The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. <br />
Hope arms their courage: from their tow&#8217;rs they throw <br />
Their darts with double force, and drive the foe. <br />
Thus, at the signal giv&#8217;n, the cranes arise <br />
Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies. <br />
King Turnus wonder&#8217;d at the fight renew&#8217;d, <br />
Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view&#8217;d, <br />
The seas with swelling canvas cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
And the swift ships descending on the shore. <br />
The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes, <br />
The radiant crest that seem&#8217;d in flames to rise, <br />
And dart diffusive fires around the field, <br />
And the keen glitt&#8217;ring of the golden shield. <br />
Thus threat&#8217;ning comets, when by night they rise, <br />
Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies: <br />
So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights, <br />
Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine frights. <br />
Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent <br />
To man the shores, and hinder their descent, <br />
And thus awakes the courage of his friends: <br />
&#8220;What you so long have wish&#8217;d, kind Fortune sends; <br />
In ardent arms to meet th&#8217; invading foe: <br />
You find, and find him at advantage now. <br />
Yours is the day: you need but only dare; <br />
Your swords will make you masters of the war. <br />
Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands, <br />
And dearest wifes, are all within your hands. <br />
Be mindful of the race from whence you came, <br />
And emulate in arms your fathers&#8217; fame. <br />
Now take the time, while stagg&#8217;ring yet they stand <br />
With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand: <br />
Fortune befriends the bold.&#8221; Nor more he said, <br />
But balanc&#8217;d whom to leave, and whom to lead; <br />
Then these elects, the landing to prevent; <br />
And those he leaves, to keep the city pent. <br />
Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore: <br />
Some are by boats expos&#8217;d, by bridges more. <br />
With lab&#8217;ring oars they bear along the strand, <br />
Where the tide languishes, and leap aland. <br />
Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes, <br />
And, where no ford he finds, no water fries, <br />
Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar, <br />
But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore, <br />
That course he steer&#8217;d, and thus he gave command: <br />
&#8216;Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land: <br />
Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound <br />
This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. <br />
Let me securely land&#8211;I ask no more; <br />
Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.&#8221; <br />
This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends: <br />
They tug at ev&#8217;ry oar, and ev&#8217;ry stretcher bends; <br />
They run their ships aground; the vessels knock, <br />
(Thus forc&#8217;d ashore,) and tremble with the shock. <br />
Tarchon&#8217;s alone was lost, that stranded stood, <br />
Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood: <br />
She breaks her back; the loosen&#8217;d sides give way, <br />
And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea. <br />
Their broken oars and floating planks withstand <br />
Their passage, while they labor to the land, <br />
And ebbing tides bear back upon th&#8217; uncertain sand. <br />
Now Turnus leads his troops without delay, <br />
Advancing to the margin of the sea. <br />
The trumpets sound: AEneas first assail&#8217;d <br />
The clowns new-rais&#8217;d and raw, and soon prevail&#8217;d. <br />
Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight; <br />
Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height. <br />
He first in open field defied the prince: <br />
But armor scal&#8217;d with gold was no defense <br />
Against the fated sword, which open&#8217;d wide <br />
His plated shield, and pierc&#8217;d his naked side. <br />
Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, <br />
Was from his wretched mother ripp&#8217;d and torn; <br />
Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; <br />
For his beginning life from biting steel was free. <br />
Not far from him was Gyas laid along, <br />
Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: <br />
Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail&#8217;d, <br />
Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail&#8217;d, <br />
Nor their fam&#8217;d father, wont in war to go <br />
With great Alcides, while he toil&#8217;d below. <br />
The noisy Pharos next receiv&#8217;d his death: <br />
AEneas writh&#8217;d his dart, and stopp&#8217;d his bawling breath. <br />
Then wretched Cydon had receiv&#8217;d his doom, <br />
Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, <br />
And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: <br />
The Trojan sword had cur&#8217;d his love of boys, <br />
Had not his sev&#8217;n bold brethren stopp&#8217;d the course <br />
Of the fierce champions, with united force. <br />
Sev&#8217;n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound <br />
From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: <br />
The rest had reach&#8217;d him; but his mother&#8217;s care <br />
Prevented those, and turn&#8217;d aside in air. <br />
The prince then call&#8217;d Achates, to supply <br />
The spears that knew the way to victory&#8211; <br />
&#8220;Those fatal weapons, which, inur&#8217;d to blood, <br />
In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: <br />
Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain <br />
Against our foes, on this contended plain.&#8221; <br />
He said; then seiz&#8217;d a mighty spear, and threw; <br />
Which, wing&#8217;d with fate, thro&#8217; Maeon&#8217;s buckler flew, <br />
Pierc&#8217;d all the brazen plates, and reach&#8217;d his heart: <br />
He stagger&#8217;d with intolerable smart. <br />
Alcanor saw; and reach&#8217;d, but reach&#8217;d in vain, <br />
His helping hand, his brother to sustain. <br />
A second spear, which kept the former course, <br />
From the same hand, and sent with equal force, <br />
His right arm pierc&#8217;d, and holding on, bereft <br />
His use of both, and pinion&#8217;d down his left. <br />
Then Numitor from his dead brother drew <br />
Th&#8217; ill-omen&#8217;d spear, and at the Trojan threw: <br />
Preventing fate directs the lance awry, <br />
Which, glancing, only mark&#8217;d Achates&#8217; thigh. <br />
In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came, <br />
And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. <br />
The spear flew hissing thro&#8217; the middle space, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d his throat, directed at his face; <br />
It stopp&#8217;d at once the passage of his wind, <br />
And the free soul to flitting air resign&#8217;d: <br />
His forehead was the first that struck the ground; <br />
Lifeblood and life rush&#8217;d mingled thro&#8217; the wound. <br />
He slew three brothers of the Borean race, <br />
And three, whom Ismarus, their native place, <br />
Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace. <br />
Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: <br />
The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds, <br />
Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand, <br />
These fight to keep, and those to win, the land. <br />
With mutual blood th&#8217; Ausonian soil is dyed, <br />
While on its borders each their claim decide. <br />
As wintry winds, contending in the sky, <br />
With equal force of lungs their titles try: <br />
They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav&#8217;n <br />
Stands without motion, and the tide undriv&#8217;n: <br />
Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, <br />
They long suspend the fortune of the field. <br />
Both armies thus perform what courage can; <br />
Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man. <br />
But, in another part, th&#8217; Arcadian horse <br />
With ill success ingage the Latin force: <br />
For, where th&#8217; impetuous torrent, rushing down, <br />
Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, <br />
They left their coursers, and, unus&#8217;d to fight <br />
On foot, were scatter&#8217;d in a shameful flight. <br />
Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view&#8217;d <br />
His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued, <br />
Us&#8217;d threat&#8217;nings mix&#8217;d with pray&#8217;rs, his last resource, <br />
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force. <br />
&#8220;Which way, companions? whether would you run? <br />
By you yourselves, and mighty battles won, <br />
By my great sire, by his establish&#8217;d name, <br />
And early promise of my future fame; <br />
By my youth, emulous of equal right <br />
To share his honors&#8211;shun ignoble flight! <br />
Trust not your feet: your hands must hew your way <br />
Thro&#8217; yon black body, and that thick array: <br />
&#8216;T is thro&#8217; that forward path that we must come; <br />
There lies our way, and that our passage home. <br />
Nor pow&#8217;rs above, nor destinies below <br />
Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go, <br />
With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. <br />
See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore, <br />
The sea behind, our enemies before; <br />
No passage left, unless we swim the main; <br />
Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain.&#8221; <br />
This said, he strode with eager haste along, <br />
And bore amidst the thickest of the throng. <br />
Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe, <br />
Had heav&#8217;d a stone of mighty weight, to throw: <br />
Stooping, the spear descended on his chine, <br />
Just where the bone distinguished either loin: <br />
It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, <br />
That scarce the victor forc&#8217;d the steel away. <br />
Hisbon came on: but, while he mov&#8217;d too slow <br />
To wish&#8217;d revenge, the prince prevents his blow; <br />
For, warding his at once, at once he press&#8217;d, <br />
And plung&#8217;d the fatal weapon in his breast. <br />
Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust, <br />
Who stain&#8217;d his stepdam&#8217;s bed with impious lust. <br />
And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain, <br />
Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain; <br />
So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size, <br />
As caus&#8217;d an error in their parents&#8217; eyes&#8211; <br />
Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides <br />
The nice distinction, and their fate divides: <br />
For Thymbrus&#8217; head was lopp&#8217;d; and Laris&#8217; hand, <br />
Dismember&#8217;d, sought its owner on the strand: <br />
The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain, <br />
And threaten still th&#8217; intended stroke in vain. <br />
Now, to renew the charge, th&#8217; Arcadians came: <br />
Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, <br />
And grief, with anger mix&#8217;d, their minds inflame. <br />
Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain, <br />
Who chanc&#8217;d, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain: <br />
The flying spear was after Ilus sent; <br />
But Rhoeteus happen&#8217;d on a death unmeant: <br />
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled, <br />
The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead: <br />
Roll&#8217;d from his chariot with a mortal wound, <br />
And intercepted fate, he spurn&#8217;d the ground. <br />
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise, <br />
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies, <br />
And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads, <br />
And catching flames infect the neighb&#8217;ring heads; <br />
Around the forest flies the furious blast, <br />
And all the leafy nation sinks at last, <br />
And Vulcan rides in triumph o&#8217;er the waste; <br />
The pastor, pleas&#8217;d with his dire victory, <br />
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky: <br />
So Pallas&#8217; troops their scatter&#8217;d strength unite, <br />
And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. <br />
Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood; <br />
But first collected in his arms he stood: <br />
Advancing then, he plied the spear so well, <br />
Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell. <br />
Around his head he toss&#8217;d his glitt&#8217;ring brand, <br />
And from Strymonius hew&#8217;d his better hand, <br />
Held up to guard his throat; then hurl&#8217;d a stone <br />
At Thoas&#8217; ample front, and pierc&#8217;d the bone: <br />
It struck beneath the space of either eye; <br />
And blood, and mingled brains, together fly. <br />
Deep skill&#8217;d in future fates, Halesus&#8217; sire <br />
Did with the youth to lonely groves retire: <br />
But, when the father&#8217;s mortal race was run, <br />
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son, <br />
And haul&#8217;d him to the war, to find, beneath <br />
Th&#8217; Evandrian spear, a memorable death. <br />
Pallas th&#8217; encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, <br />
To Tuscan Tiber thus address&#8217;d his vows: <br />
&#8220;O sacred stream, direct my flying dart, <br />
And give to pass the proud Halesus&#8217; heart! <br />
His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear.&#8221; <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the bribe, the god receiv&#8217;d his pray&#8217;r: <br />
For, while his shield protects a friend distress&#8217;d, <br />
The dart came driving on, and pierc&#8217;d his breast. <br />
But Lausus, no small portion of the war, <br />
Permits not panic fear to reign too far, <br />
Caus&#8217;d by the death of so renown&#8217;d a knight; <br />
But by his own example cheers the fight. <br />
Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay <br />
Of Trojan hopes, and hind&#8217;rance of the day. <br />
The Phrygian troops escap&#8217;d the Greeks in vain: <br />
They, and their mix&#8217;d allies, now load the plain. <br />
To the rude shock of war both armies came; <br />
Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. <br />
The rear so press&#8217;d the front, they could not wield <br />
Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. <br />
Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: <br />
Of equal youth and beauty both appear, <br />
But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. <br />
Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: <br />
Both doom&#8217;d to fall, but fall by greater hands. <br />
Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief <br />
Of Lausus&#8217; danger, urging swift relief. <br />
With his driv&#8217;n chariot he divides the crowd, <br />
And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: <br />
&#8220;Let none presume his needless aid to join; <br />
Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: <br />
To this right hand is Pallas only due; <br />
O were his father here, my just revenge to view!&#8221; <br />
From the forbidden space his men retir&#8217;d. <br />
Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir&#8217;d; <br />
Survey&#8217;d him o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er with wond&#8217;ring sight, <br />
Struck with his haughty mien, and tow&#8217;ring height. <br />
Then to the king: &#8220;Your empty vaunts forbear; <br />
Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; <br />
Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name; <br />
Jove is impartial, and to both the same.&#8221; <br />
He said, and to the void advanc&#8217;d his pace: <br />
Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. <br />
Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, <br />
Address&#8217;d himself on foot to single fight. <br />
And, as a lion&#8211;when he spies from far <br />
A bull that seems to meditate the war, <br />
Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand&#8211; <br />
Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: <br />
Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, <br />
To rush from high on his unequal foe. <br />
Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance <br />
Within due distance of his flying lance, <br />
Prepares to charge him first, resolv&#8217;d to try <br />
If fortune would his want of force supply; <br />
And thus to Heav&#8217;n and Hercules address&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;Alcides, once on earth Evander&#8217;s guest, <br />
His son adjures you by those holy rites, <br />
That hospitable board, those genial nights; <br />
Assist my great attempt to gain this prize, <br />
And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes, <br />
His ravish&#8217;d spoils.&#8221; &#8216;T was heard, the vain request; <br />
Alcides mourn&#8217;d, and stifled sighs within his breast. <br />
Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began: <br />
&#8220;Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. <br />
&#8216;T is virtue&#8217;s work alone to stretch the narrow span. <br />
So many sons of gods, in bloody fight, <br />
Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light: <br />
My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe; <br />
Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath, <br />
And stands already on the verge of death.&#8221; <br />
This said, the god permits the fatal fight, <br />
But from the Latian fields averts his sight. <br />
Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw, <br />
And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew <br />
The steel just graz&#8217;d along the shoulder joint, <br />
And mark&#8217;d it slightly with the glancing point, <br />
Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew, <br />
And pois&#8217;d his pointed spear, before he threw: <br />
Then, as the winged weapon whizz&#8217;d along, <br />
&#8220;See now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;whose arm is better strung.&#8221; <br />
The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay&#8217;d <br />
By plates of ir&#8217;n, which o&#8217;er the shield were laid: <br />
Thro&#8217; folded brass and tough bull hides it pass&#8217;d, <br />
His corslet pierc&#8217;d, and reach&#8217;d his heart at last. <br />
In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood; <br />
The soul comes issuing with the vital blood: <br />
He falls; his arms upon his body sound; <br />
And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. <br />
Turnus bestrode the corpse: &#8220;Arcadians, hear,&#8221; <br />
Said he; &#8220;my message to your master bear: <br />
Such as the sire deserv&#8217;d, the son I send; <br />
It costs him dear to be the Phrygians&#8217; friend. <br />
The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow, <br />
Unask&#8217;d, to rest his wand&#8217;ring ghost below.&#8221; <br />
He said, and trampled down with all the force <br />
Of his left foot, and spurn&#8217;d the wretched corse; <br />
Then snatch&#8217;d the shining belt, with gold inlaid; <br />
The belt Eurytion&#8217;s artful hands had made, <br />
Where fifty fatal brides, express&#8217;d to sight, <br />
All in the compass of one mournful night, <br />
Depriv&#8217;d their bridegrooms of returning light. <br />
In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore <br />
Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. <br />
O mortals, blind in fate, who never know <br />
To bear high fortune, or endure the low! <br />
The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, <br />
Shall wish untouch&#8217;d the trophies of the slain; <br />
Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, <br />
And curse the dire remembrance of the day. <br />
The sad Arcadians, from th&#8217; unhappy field, <br />
Bear back the breathless body on a shield. <br />
O grace and grief of war! at once restor&#8217;d, <br />
With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor&#8217;d! <br />
One day first sent thee to the fighting field, <br />
Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill&#8217;d; <br />
One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. <br />
This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, <br />
But sad spectators, to the hero came: <br />
His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, <br />
Unless reliev&#8217;d by his victorious hand. <br />
He whirls his sword around, without delay, <br />
And hews thro&#8217; adverse foes an ample way, <br />
To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: <br />
Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow&#8217;d <br />
To large deserts, are present to his eyes; <br />
His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. <br />
Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, <br />
He took in fight, and living victims led, <br />
To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, <br />
In sacrifice, before his fun&#8217;ral fire. <br />
At Magus next he threw: he stoop&#8217;d below <br />
The flying spear, and shunn&#8217;d the promis&#8217;d blow; <br />
Then, creeping, clasp&#8217;d the hero&#8217;s knees, and pray&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;By young Iulus, by thy father&#8217;s shade, <br />
O spare my life, and send me back to see <br />
My longing sire, and tender progeny! <br />
A lofty house I have, and wealth untold, <br />
In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: <br />
All these, and sums besides, which see no day, <br />
The ransom of this one poor life shall pay. <br />
If I survive, will Troy the less prevail? <br />
A single soul&#8217;s too light to turn the scale.&#8221; <br />
He said. The hero sternly thus replied: <br />
&#8220;Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, <br />
Leave for thy children&#8217;s lot. Thy Turnus broke <br />
All rules of war by one relentless stroke, <br />
When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone <br />
My father&#8217;s shadow, but my living son.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft, <br />
He seiz&#8217;d his helm, and dragg&#8217;d him with his left; <br />
Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath&#8217;d, <br />
Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath&#8217;d. <br />
Apollo&#8217;s priest, Emonides, was near; <br />
His holy fillets on his front appear; <br />
Glitt&#8217;ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd; <br />
Much of his god, more of his purple, proud. <br />
Him the fierce Trojan follow&#8217;d thro&#8217; the field: <br />
The holy coward fell; and, forc&#8217;d to yield, <br />
The prince stood o&#8217;er the priest, and, at one blow, <br />
Sent him an off&#8217;ring to the shades below. <br />
His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears, <br />
Design&#8217;d a trophy to the God of Wars. <br />
Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight, <br />
And Umbro, born upon the mountains&#8217; height. <br />
The champion cheers his troops t&#8217; encounter those, <br />
And seeks revenge himself on other foes. <br />
At Anxur&#8217;s shield he drove; and, at the blow, <br />
Both shield and arm to ground together go. <br />
Anxur had boasted much of magic charms, <br />
And thought he wore impenetrable arms, <br />
So made by mutter&#8217;d spells; and, from the spheres, <br />
Had life secur&#8217;d, in vain, for length of years. <br />
Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod; <br />
A nymph his mother, and his sire a god. <br />
Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince: <br />
With his protended lance he makes defense; <br />
Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, <br />
Arrests his better hand, and drags him down; <br />
Stands o&#8217;er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay, <br />
Vain tales inventing, and prepar&#8217;d to pray, <br />
Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, <br />
Then sunk, and roll&#8217;d along the sand in blood. <br />
The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain: <br />
&#8220;Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain; <br />
Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb, <br />
Far from thy mother and thy native home, <br />
Expos&#8217;d to savage beasts, and birds of prey, <br />
Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea.&#8221; <br />
On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran, <br />
Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van. <br />
They fled for fear; with these, he chas&#8217;d along <br />
Camers the yellow-lock&#8217;d, and Numa strong; <br />
Both great in arms, and both were fair and young. <br />
Camers was son to Volscens lately slain, <br />
In wealth surpassing all the Latian train, <br />
And in Amycla fix&#8217;d his silent easy reign. <br />
And, as AEgaeon, when with heav&#8217;n he strove, <br />
Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; <br />
Mov&#8217;d all his hundred hands, provok&#8217;d the war, <br />
Defied the forky lightning from afar; <br />
At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, <br />
And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; <br />
In his right hand as many swords he wields, <br />
And takes the thunder on as many shields: <br />
With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; <br />
And soon the fields with falling corps were strow&#8217;d, <br />
When once his fauchion found the taste of blood. <br />
With fury scarce to be conceiv&#8217;d, he flew <br />
Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. <br />
They, when they see the fiery chief advance, <br />
And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, <br />
Wheel&#8217;d with so swift a motion, mad with fear, <br />
They threw their master headlong from the chair. <br />
They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before <br />
They bear the bounding chariot to the shore. <br />
Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, <br />
With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, <br />
And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains: <br />
Bold brethren both. The former wav&#8217;d in air <br />
His flaming sword: AEneas couch&#8217;d his spear, <br />
Unus&#8217;d to threats, and more unus&#8217;d to fear. <br />
Then Liger thus: &#8220;Thy confidence is vain <br />
To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain: <br />
Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, <br />
Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode; <br />
Nor Venus&#8217; veil is here, near Neptune&#8217;s shield; <br />
Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field.&#8221; <br />
Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer <br />
Return&#8217;d his answer with his flying spear. <br />
As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, <br />
Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, <br />
Prepar&#8217;d for fight; the fatal dart arrives, <br />
And thro&#8217; the borders of his buckler drives; <br />
Pass&#8217;d thro&#8217; and pierc&#8217;d his groin: the deadly wound, <br />
Cast from his chariot, roll&#8217;d him on the ground. <br />
Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite: <br />
&#8220;Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; <br />
Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat; <br />
But you yourself forsake your empty seat.&#8221; <br />
He said, and seiz&#8217;d at once the loosen&#8217;d rein; <br />
For Liger lay already on the plain, <br />
By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands, <br />
The recreant thus his wretched life demands: <br />
&#8220;Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man! <br />
By her and him from whom thy breath began, <br />
Who form&#8217;d thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare <br />
This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant&#8217;s pray&#8217;r.&#8221; <br />
Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said; <br />
But the stern hero turn&#8217;d aside his head, <br />
And cut him short: &#8220;I hear another man; <br />
You talk&#8217;d not thus before the fight began. <br />
Now take your turn; and, as a brother should, <br />
Attend your brother to the Stygian flood.&#8221; <br />
Then thro&#8217; his breast his fatal sword he sent, <br />
And the soul issued at the gaping vent. <br />
As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, <br />
Thus rag&#8217;d the prince, and scatter&#8217;d deaths around. <br />
At length Ascanius and the Trojan train <br />
Broke from the camp, so long besieg&#8217;d in vain. <br />
Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man <br />
Held conference with his queen, and thus began: <br />
&#8220;My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, <br />
Still think you Venus&#8217; aid supports the strife&#8211; <br />
Sustains her Trojans&#8211;or themselves, alone, <br />
With inborn valor force their fortune on? <br />
How fierce in fight, with courage undecay&#8217;d! <br />
Judge if such warriors want immortal aid.&#8221; <br />
To whom the goddess with the charming eyes, <br />
Soft in her tone, submissively replies: <br />
&#8220;Why, O my sov&#8217;reign lord, whose frown I fear, <br />
And cannot, unconcern&#8217;d, your anger bear; <br />
Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still <br />
(As once I was) were mistress of your will, <br />
From your almighty pow&#8217;r your pleasing wife <br />
Might gain the grace of length&#8217;ning Turnus&#8217; life, <br />
Securely snatch him from the fatal fight, <br />
And give him to his aged father&#8217;s sight. <br />
Now let him perish, since you hold it good, <br />
And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. <br />
Yet from our lineage he derives his name, <br />
And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; <br />
Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine, <br />
And offers daily incense at your shrine.&#8221; <br />
Then shortly thus the sov&#8217;reign god replied: <br />
&#8220;Since in my pow&#8217;r and goodness you confide, <br />
If for a little space, a lengthen&#8217;d span, <br />
You beg reprieve for this expiring man, <br />
I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence <br />
From instant fate, and can so far dispense. <br />
But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, <br />
To save the short-liv&#8217;d youth from destin&#8217;d death, <br />
Or if a farther thought you entertain, <br />
To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.&#8221; <br />
To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes: <br />
&#8220;And what if that request, your tongue denies, <br />
Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, <br />
But length of certain life, to Turnus give? <br />
Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth, <br />
If my presaging soul divines with truth; <br />
Which, O! I wish, might err thro&#8217; causeless fears, <br />
And you (for you have pow&#8217;r) prolong his years!&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, involv&#8217;d in clouds, she flies, <br />
And drives a storm before her thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
Swift she descends, alighting on the plain, <br />
Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain. <br />
Of air condens&#8217;d a specter soon she made; <br />
And, what AEneas was, such seem&#8217;d the shade. <br />
Adorn&#8217;d with Dardan arms, the phantom bore <br />
His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore; <br />
This hand appear&#8217;d a shining sword to wield, <br />
And that sustain&#8217;d an imitated shield. <br />
With manly mien he stalk&#8217;d along the ground, <br />
Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. <br />
(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, <br />
Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) <br />
The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare, <br />
And flourishes his empty sword in air. <br />
At this, advancing, Turnus hurl&#8217;d his spear: <br />
The phantom wheel&#8217;d, and seem&#8217;d to fly for fear. <br />
Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, <br />
And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. <br />
&#8220;Whether, O coward?&#8221; (thus he calls aloud, <br />
Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas&#8217;d a cloud,) <br />
&#8220;Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me <br />
The fated land you sought so long by sea.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, brandishing at once his blade, <br />
With eager pace pursued the flying shade. <br />
By chance a ship was fasten&#8217;d to the shore, <br />
Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore: <br />
The plank was ready laid for safe ascent; <br />
For shelter there the trembling shadow bent, <br />
And skipp&#8217;t and skulk&#8217;d, and under hatches went. <br />
Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, <br />
Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass&#8217;d. <br />
Scarce had he reach&#8217;d the prow: Saturnia&#8217;s hand <br />
The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. <br />
With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, <br />
And measures back with speed her former way. <br />
Meantime AEneas seeks his absent foe, <br />
And sends his slaughter&#8217;d troops to shades below. <br />
The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, <br />
And flew sublime, and vanish&#8217;d in a cloud. <br />
Too late young Turnus the delusion found, <br />
Far on the sea, still making from the ground. <br />
Then, thankless for a life redeem&#8217;d by shame, <br />
With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame, <br />
Fearful besides of what in fight had pass&#8217;d, <br />
His hands and haggard eyes to heav&#8217;n he cast; <br />
&#8220;O Jove!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;for what offense have I <br />
Deserv&#8217;d to bear this endless infamy? <br />
Whence am I forc&#8217;d, and whether am I borne? <br />
How, and with what reproach, shall I return? <br />
Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, <br />
Or see Laurentum&#8217;s lofty tow&#8217;rs again? <br />
What will they say of their deserting chief? <br />
The war was mine: I fly from their relief; <br />
I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; <br />
And ev&#8217;n from hence their dying groans receive. <br />
Here, overmatch&#8217;d in fight, in heaps they lie; <br />
There, scatter&#8217;d o&#8217;er the fields, ignobly fly. <br />
Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! <br />
Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! <br />
On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; <br />
Or set me shipwrack&#8217;d on some desart shore, <br />
Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more, <br />
Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame, <br />
Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.&#8221; <br />
Thus Turnus rav&#8217;d, and various fates revolv&#8217;d: <br />
The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv&#8217;d. <br />
And now the sword, and now the sea took place, <br />
That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace. <br />
Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, <br />
By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. <br />
Thrice he the sword assay&#8217;d, and thrice the flood; <br />
But Juno, mov&#8217;d with pity, both withstood. <br />
And thrice repress&#8217;d his rage; strong gales supplied, <br />
And push&#8217;d the vessel o&#8217;er the swelling tide. <br />
At length she lands him on his native shores, <br />
And to his father&#8217;s longing arms restores. <br />
Meantime, by Jove&#8217;s impulse, Mezentius arm&#8217;d, <br />
Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm&#8217;d <br />
His fainting friends, reproach&#8217;d their shameful flight, <br />
Repell&#8217;d the victors, and renew&#8217;d the fight. <br />
Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire; <br />
Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire <br />
Of wish&#8217;d revenge: on him, and him alone, <br />
All hands employ&#8217;d, and all their darts are thrown. <br />
He, like a solid rock by seas inclos&#8217;d, <br />
To raging winds and roaring waves oppos&#8217;d, <br />
From his proud summit looking down, disdains <br />
Their empty menace, and unmov&#8217;d remains. <br />
Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, <br />
Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. <br />
At Latagus a weighty stone he flung: <br />
His face was flatted, and his helmet rung. <br />
But Palmus from behind receives his wound; <br />
Hamstring&#8217;d he falls, and grovels on the ground: <br />
His crest and armor, from his body torn, <br />
Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn. <br />
Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew. <br />
Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew, <br />
Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire, <br />
The queen produc&#8217;d young Paris to his sire: <br />
But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, <br />
Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain. <br />
And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, <br />
With forest mast and fatt&#8217;ning marshes fed, <br />
When once he sees himself in toils inclos&#8217;d, <br />
By huntsmen and their eager hounds appos&#8217;d&#8211; <br />
He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war; <br />
Th&#8217; invaders dart their jav&#8217;lins from afar: <br />
All keep aloof, and safely shout around; <br />
But none presumes to give a nearer wound: <br />
He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide, <br />
And shakes a grove of lances from his side: <br />
Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir&#8217;d, <br />
And just revenge against the tyrant fir&#8217;d, <br />
Their darts with clamor at a distance drive, <br />
And only keep the languish&#8217;d war alive. <br />
From Coritus came Acron to the fight, <br />
Who left his spouse betroth&#8217;d, and unconsummate night. <br />
Mezentius sees him thro&#8217; the squadrons ride, <br />
Proud of the purple favors of his bride. <br />
Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds <br />
A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, <br />
Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain&#8211; <br />
He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane, <br />
He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws; <br />
The prey lies panting underneath his paws: <br />
He fills his famish&#8217;d maw; his mouth runs o&#8217;er <br />
With unchew&#8217;d morsels, while he churns the gore: <br />
So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes, <br />
And first unhappy Acron overthrows: <br />
Stretch&#8217;d at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground; <br />
The lance, besmear&#8217;d with blood, lies broken in the wound. <br />
Then with disdain the haughty victor view&#8217;d <br />
Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, <br />
Nor thought the dastard&#8217;s back deserv&#8217;d a wound, <br />
But, running, gain&#8217;d th&#8217; advantage of the ground: <br />
Then turning short, he met him face to face, <br />
To give his victory the better grace. <br />
Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress&#8217;d: <br />
Mezentius fix&#8217;d his foot upon his breast, <br />
And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: <br />
&#8220;Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!&#8221; <br />
The fields around with Io Paean! ring; <br />
And peals of shouts applaud the conqu&#8217;ring king. <br />
At this the vanquish&#8217;d, with his dying breath, <br />
Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death: <br />
&#8220;Nor thou, proud man, unpunish&#8217;d shalt remain: <br />
Like death attends thee on this fatal plain.&#8221; <br />
Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied: <br />
&#8220;For what belongs to me, let Jove provide; <br />
But die thou first, whatever chance ensue.&#8221; <br />
He said, and from the wound the weapon drew. <br />
A hov&#8217;ring mist came swimming o&#8217;er his sight, <br />
And seal&#8217;d his eyes in everlasting night. <br />
By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain; <br />
Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain; <br />
Orses the strong to greater strength must yield; <br />
He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill&#8217;d. <br />
Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew, <br />
Who from Lycaon&#8217;s blood his lineage drew. <br />
But from his headstrong horse his fate he found, <br />
Who threw his master, as he made a bound: <br />
The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground; <br />
Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: <br />
The Trojan sinks, and Neptune&#8217;s son prevails. <br />
Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride, <br />
To single fight the boldest foe defied; <br />
Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o&#8217;ercame, <br />
And not belied his mighty father&#8217;s fame. <br />
Salius to death the great Antronius sent: <br />
But the same fate the victor underwent, <br />
Slain by Nealces&#8217; hand, well-skill&#8217;d to throw <br />
The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. <br />
Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance; <br />
By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: <br />
Victors and vanquish&#8217;d, in the various field, <br />
Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. <br />
The gods from heav&#8217;n survey the fatal strife, <br />
And mourn the miseries of human life. <br />
Above the rest, two goddesses appear <br />
Concern&#8217;d for each: here Venus, Juno there. <br />
Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes <br />
Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. <br />
Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, <br />
Brandish&#8217;d his spear, and rush&#8217;d into the plain, <br />
Where tow&#8217;ring in the midmost rank she stood, <br />
Like tall Orion stalking o&#8217;er the flood. <br />
(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, <br />
His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), <br />
Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, <br />
Deep fix&#8217;d in earth; in clouds he hides his head. <br />
The Trojan prince beheld him from afar, <br />
And dauntless undertook the doubtful war. <br />
Collected in his strength, and like a rock, <br />
Pois&#8217;d on his base, Mezentius stood the shock. <br />
He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes <br />
The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: <br />
&#8220;My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! <br />
(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.) <br />
His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn, <br />
By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.&#8221; <br />
He said; and with his utmost force he threw <br />
The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, <br />
Reach&#8217;d the celestial shield, that stopp&#8217;d the course; <br />
But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force <br />
Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt <br />
The side and bowels fam&#8217;d Anthores fix&#8217;d. <br />
Anthores had from Argos travel&#8217;d far, <br />
Alcides&#8217; friend, and brother of the war; <br />
Till, tir&#8217;d with toils, fair Italy he chose, <br />
And in Evander&#8217;s palace sought repose. <br />
Now, falling by another&#8217;s wound, his eyes <br />
He cast to heav&#8217;n, on Argos thinks, and dies. <br />
The pious Trojan then his jav&#8217;lin sent; <br />
The shield gave way; thro&#8217; treble plates it went <br />
Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll&#8217;d, <br />
And three bull hides which round the buckler fold. <br />
All these it pass&#8217;d, resistless in the course, <br />
Transpierc&#8217;d his thigh, and spent its dying force. <br />
The gaping wound gush&#8217;d out a crimson flood. <br />
The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood, <br />
His faunchion drew, to closer fight address&#8217;d, <br />
And with new force his fainting foe oppress&#8217;d. <br />
His father&#8217;s peril Lausus view&#8217;d with grief; <br />
He sigh&#8217;d, he wept, he ran to his relief. <br />
And here, heroic youth, &#8216;t is here I must <br />
To thy immortal memory be just, <br />
And sing an act so noble and so new, <br />
Posterity will scarce believe &#8216;t is true. <br />
Pain&#8217;d with his wound, and useless for the fight, <br />
The father sought to save himself by flight: <br />
Incumber&#8217;d, slow he dragg&#8217;d the spear along, <br />
Which pierc&#8217;d his thigh, and in his buckler hung. <br />
The pious youth, resolv&#8217;d on death, below <br />
The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe; <br />
Protects his parent, and prevents the blow. <br />
Shouts of applause ran ringing thro&#8217; the field, <br />
To see the son the vanquish&#8217;d father shield. <br />
All, fir&#8217;d with gen&#8217;rous indignation, strive, <br />
And with a storm of darts to distance drive <br />
The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far, <br />
On his Vulcanian orb sustain&#8217;d the war. <br />
As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, <br />
The plowman, passenger, and lab&#8217;ring hind <br />
For shelter to the neighb&#8217;ring covert fly, <br />
Or hous&#8217;d, or safe in hollow caverns lie; <br />
But, that o&#8217;erblown, when heav&#8217;n above &#8216;em smiles, <br />
Return to travel, and renew their toils: <br />
AEneas thus, o&#8217;erwhelmed on ev&#8217;ry side, <br />
The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; <br />
And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat&#8217;ning cried: <br />
&#8220;Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage <br />
In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age, <br />
Betray&#8217;d by pious love?&#8221; Nor, thus forborne, <br />
The youth desists, but with insulting scorn <br />
Provokes the ling&#8217;ring prince, whose patience, tir&#8217;d, <br />
Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir&#8217;d. <br />
For now the Fates prepar&#8217;d their sharpen&#8217;d shears; <br />
And lifted high the flaming sword appears, <br />
Which, full descending with a frightful sway, <br />
Thro&#8217; shield and corslet forc&#8217;d th&#8217; impetuous way, <br />
And buried deep in his fair bosom lay. <br />
The purple streams thro&#8217; the thin armor strove, <br />
And drench&#8217;d th&#8217; imbroider&#8217;d coat his mother wove; <br />
And life at length forsook his heaving heart, <br />
Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart. <br />
But when, with blood and paleness all o&#8217;erspread, <br />
The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead, <br />
He griev&#8217;d; he wept; the sight an image brought <br />
Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought: <br />
Then stretch&#8217;d his hand to hold him up, and said: <br />
&#8220;Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid <br />
To love so great, to such transcendent store <br />
Of early worth, and sure presage of more? <br />
Accept whate&#8217;er AEneas can afford; <br />
Untouch&#8217;d thy arms, untaken be thy sword; <br />
And all that pleas&#8217;d thee living, still remain <br />
Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. <br />
Thy body on thy parents I bestow, <br />
To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, <br />
Or have a sense of human things below. <br />
There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: <br />
&#8220;&#8216;T was by the great AEneas&#8217; hand I fell.&#8217;&#8221; <br />
With this, his distant friends he beckons near, <br />
Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: <br />
Himself assists to lift him from the ground, <br />
With clotted locks, and blood that well&#8217;d from out the wound. <br />
Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, <br />
And wash&#8217;d his wounds by Tiber&#8217;s yellow flood: <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with anguish, panting, and o&#8217;erspent, <br />
His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. <br />
A bough his brazen helmet did sustain; <br />
His heavier arms lay scatter&#8217;d on the plain: <br />
A chosen train of youth around him stand; <br />
His drooping head was rested on his hand: <br />
His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; <br />
And all on Lausus ran his restless thought. <br />
Careful, concern&#8217;d his danger to prevent, <br />
He much enquir&#8217;d, and many a message sent <br />
To warn him from the field&#8211;alas! in vain! <br />
Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! <br />
O&#8217;er his broad shield still gush&#8217;d the yawning wound, <br />
And drew a bloody trail along the ground. <br />
Far off he heard their cries, far off divin&#8217;d <br />
The dire event, with a foreboding mind. <br />
With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; <br />
Then both his lifted hands to heav&#8217;n he spread; <br />
Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: <br />
&#8220;What joys, alas! could this frail being give, <br />
That I have been so covetous to live? <br />
To see my son, and such a son, resign <br />
His life, a ransom for preserving mine! <br />
And am I then preserv&#8217;d, and art thou lost? <br />
How much too dear has that redemption cost! <br />
&#8216;T is now my bitter banishment I feel: <br />
This is a wound too deep for time to heal. <br />
My guilt thy growing virtues did defame; <br />
My blackness blotted thy unblemish&#8217;d name. <br />
Chas&#8217;d from a throne, abandon&#8217;d, and exil&#8217;d <br />
For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild: <br />
I ow&#8217;d my people these, and, from their hate, <br />
With less resentment could have borne my fate. <br />
And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight <br />
Of hated men, and of more hated light: <br />
But will not long.&#8221; With that he rais&#8217;d from ground <br />
His fainting limbs, that stagger&#8217;d with his wound; <br />
Yet, with a mind resolv&#8217;d, and unappall&#8217;d <br />
With pains or perils, for his courser call&#8217;d; <br />
Well-mouth&#8217;d, well-manag&#8217;d, whom himself did dress <br />
With daily care, and mounted with success; <br />
His aid in arms, his ornament in peace. <br />
Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke, <br />
The steed seem&#8217;d sensible, while thus he spoke: <br />
&#8220;O Rhoebus, we have liv&#8217;d too long for me&#8211; <br />
If life and long were terms that could agree! <br />
This day thou either shalt bring back the head <br />
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; <br />
This day thou either shalt revenge my woe, <br />
For murther&#8217;d Lausus, on his cruel foe; <br />
Or, if inexorable fate deny <br />
Our conquest, with thy conquer&#8217;d master die: <br />
For, after such a lord, I rest secure, <br />
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.&#8221; <br />
He said; and straight th&#8217; officious courser kneels, <br />
To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills <br />
With pointed jav&#8217;lins; on his head he lac&#8217;d <br />
His glitt&#8217;ring helm, which terribly was grac&#8217;d <br />
With waving horsehair, nodding from afar; <br />
Then spurr&#8217;d his thund&#8217;ring steed amidst the war. <br />
Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, <br />
Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought <br />
Of inborn worth, his lab&#8217;ring soul oppress&#8217;d, <br />
Roll&#8217;d in his eyes, and rag&#8217;d within his breast. <br />
Then loud he call&#8217;d AEneas thrice by name: <br />
The loud repeated voice to glad AEneas came. <br />
&#8220;Great Jove,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the far-shooting god, <br />
Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!&#8221; <br />
He spoke no more; but hasten&#8217;d, void of fear, <br />
And threaten&#8217;d with his long protended spear. <br />
To whom Mezentius thus: &#8220;Thy vaunts are vain. <br />
My Lausus lies extended on the plain: <br />
He&#8217;s lost! thy conquest is already won; <br />
The wretched sire is murther&#8217;d in the son. <br />
Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. <br />
Forbear thy threats: my bus&#8217;ness is to die; <br />
But first receive this parting legacy.&#8221; <br />
He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; <br />
Another after, and another went. <br />
Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, <br />
And vainly plies th&#8217; impenetrable shield. <br />
Thrice rode he round; and thrice AEneas wheel&#8217;d, <br />
Turn&#8217;d as he turn&#8217;d: the golden orb withstood <br />
The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. <br />
Impatient of delay, and weary grown, <br />
Still to defend, and to defend alone, <br />
To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, <br />
Urg&#8217;d and o&#8217;er-labor&#8217;d in unequal fight; <br />
At length resolv&#8217;d, he throws with all his force <br />
Full at the temples of the warrior horse. <br />
Just where the stroke was aim&#8217;d, th&#8217; unerring spear <br />
Made way, and stood transfix&#8217;d thro&#8217; either ear. <br />
Seiz&#8217;d with unwonted pain, surpris&#8217;d with fright, <br />
The wounded steed curvets, and, rais&#8217;d upright, <br />
Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind <br />
Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. <br />
Down comes the rider headlong from his height: <br />
His horse came after with unwieldy weight, <br />
And, flound&#8217;ring forward, pitching on his head, <br />
His lord&#8217;s incumber&#8217;d shoulder overlaid. <br />
From either host, the mingled shouts and cries <br />
Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies. <br />
AEneas, hast&#8217;ning, wav&#8217;d his fatal sword <br />
High o&#8217;er his head, with this reproachful word: <br />
&#8220;Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain <br />
Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?&#8221; <br />
Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies, <br />
With scarce recover&#8217;d sight he thus replies: <br />
&#8220;Why these insulting words, this waste of breath, <br />
To souls undaunted, and secure of death? <br />
&#8216;T is no dishonor for the brave to die, <br />
Nor came I here with hope of victory; <br />
Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design: <br />
As I had us&#8217;d my fortune, use thou thine. <br />
My dying son contracted no such band; <br />
The gift is hateful from his murd&#8217;rer&#8217;s hand. <br />
For this, this only favor let me sue, <br />
If pity can to conquer&#8217;d foes be due: <br />
Refuse it not; but let my body have <br />
The last retreat of humankind, a grave. <br />
Too well I know th&#8217; insulting people&#8217;s hate; <br />
Protect me from their vengeance after fate: <br />
This refuge for my poor remains provide, <br />
And lay my much-lov&#8217;d Lausus by my side.&#8221; <br />
He said, and to the sword his throat applied. <br />
The crimson stream distain&#8217;d his arms around, <br />
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro&#8217; the wound.</p>
