				<p>THE NINTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; Turnus takes advantage of AEneas&#8217;s absence,<br />
fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs),<br />
and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduc&#8217;d to the last extremities,<br />
send Nisus and Euryalus to recall AEneas; which furnishes the<br />
poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and<br />
the conclusion of their adventures.</p>
<p>WHILE these affairs in distant places pass&#8217;d, <br />
The various Iris Juno sends with haste, <br />
To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, <br />
The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. <br />
Retir&#8217;d alone she found the daring man, <br />
And op&#8217;d her rosy lips, and thus began: <br />
&#8220;What none of all the gods could grant thy vows, <br />
That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. <br />
AEneas, gone to seek th&#8217; Arcadian prince, <br />
Has left the Trojan camp without defense; <br />
And, short of succors there, employs his pains <br />
In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. <br />
Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs; <br />
Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.&#8221; <br />
This said, on equal wings she pois&#8217;d her weight, <br />
And form&#8217;d a radiant rainbow in her flight. <br />
The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes, <br />
And thus invokes the goddess as she flies: <br />
&#8220;Iris, the grace of heav&#8217;n, what pow&#8217;r divine <br />
Has sent thee down, thro&#8217; dusky clouds to shine? <br />
See, they divide; immortal day appears, <br />
And glitt&#8217;ring planets dancing in their spheres! <br />
With joy, these happy omens I obey, <br />
And follow to the war the god that leads the way.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, as by the brook he stood, <br />
He scoop&#8217;d the water from the crystal flood; <br />
Then with his hands the drops to heav&#8217;n he throws, <br />
And loads the pow&#8217;rs above with offer&#8217;d vows. <br />
Now march the bold confed&#8217;rates thro&#8217; the plain, <br />
Well hors&#8217;d, well clad; a rich and shining train. <br />
Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear, <br />
The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear. <br />
In the main battle, with his flaming crest, <br />
The mighty Turnus tow&#8217;rs above the rest. <br />
Silent they move, majestically slow, <br />
Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. <br />
The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far, <br />
And the dark menace of the distant war. <br />
Caicus from the rampire saw it rise, <br />
Black&#8217;ning the fields, and thick&#8217;ning thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls: <br />
&#8220;What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls? <br />
Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears <br />
And pointed darts! the Latian host appears.&#8221; <br />
Thus warn&#8217;d, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend <br />
The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: <br />
For their wise gen&#8217;ral, with foreseeing care, <br />
Had charg&#8217;d them not to tempt the doubtful war, <br />
Nor, tho&#8217; provok&#8217;d, in open fields advance, <br />
But close within their lines attend their chance. <br />
Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command, <br />
And sourly wait in arms the hostile band. <br />
The fiery Turnus flew before the rest: <br />
A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press&#8217;d; <br />
His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest. <br />
With twenty horse to second his designs, <br />
An unexpected foe, he fac&#8217;d the lines. <br />
&#8220;Is there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in arms, who bravely dare <br />
His leader&#8217;s honor and his danger share?&#8221; <br />
Then spurring on, his brandish&#8217;d dart he threw, <br />
In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d to find a dastard race, that run <br />
Behind the rampires and the battle shun, <br />
He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes, <br />
And stops at ev&#8217;ry post, and ev&#8217;ry passage tries. <br />
So roams the nightly wolf about the fold: <br />
Wet with descending show&#8217;rs, and stiff with cold, <br />
He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain, <br />
(His gnashing teeth are exercis&#8217;d in vain,) <br />
And, impotent of anger, finds no way <br />
In his distended paws to grasp the prey. <br />
The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs <br />
Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams. <br />
Thus ranges eager Turnus o&#8217;er the plain. <br />
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain; <br />
Surveys each passage with a piercing sight, <br />
To force his foes in equal field to fight. <br />
Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies, <br />
Where, fenc&#8217;d with strong redoubts, their navy lies, <br />
Close underneath the walls; the washing tide <br />
Secures from all approach this weaker side. <br />
He takes the wish&#8217;d occasion, fills his hand <br />
With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand. <br />
Urg&#8217;d by his presence, ev&#8217;ry soul is warm&#8217;d, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry hand with kindled firs is arm&#8217;d. <br />
From the fir&#8217;d pines the scatt&#8217;ring sparkles fly; <br />
Fat vapors, mix&#8217;d with flames, involve the sky. <br />
What pow&#8217;r, O Muses, could avert the flame <br />
Which threaten&#8217;d, in the fleet, the Trojan name? <br />
Tell: for the fact, thro&#8217; length of time obscure, <br />
Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure. <br />
&#8216;T is said that, when the chief prepar&#8217;d his flight, <br />
And fell&#8217;d his timber from Mount Ida&#8217;s height, <br />
The grandam goddess then approach&#8217;d her son, <br />
And with a mother&#8217;s majesty begun: <br />
&#8220;Grant me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the sole request I bring, <br />
Since conquer&#8217;d heav&#8217;n has own&#8217;d you for its king. <br />
On Ida&#8217;s brows, for ages past, there stood, <br />
With firs and maples fill&#8217;d, a shady wood; <br />
And on the summit rose a sacred grove, <br />
Where I was worship&#8217;d with religious love. <br />
Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight, <br />
I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight. <br />
Now, fill&#8217;d with fear, on their behalf I come; <br />
Let neither winds o&#8217;erset, nor waves intomb <br />
The floating forests of the sacred pine; <br />
But let it be their safety to be mine.&#8221; <br />
Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls <br />
The radiant stars, and heav&#8217;n and earth controls: <br />
&#8220;How dare you, mother, endless date demand <br />
For vessels molded by a mortal hand? <br />
What then is fate? Shall bold AEneas ride, <br />
Of safety certain, on th&#8217; uncertain tide? <br />
Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o&#8217;er, <br />
The chief is landed on the Latian shore, <br />
Whatever ships escape the raging storms, <br />
At my command shall change their fading forms <br />
To nymphs divine, and plow the wat&#8217;ry way, <br />
Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea.&#8221; <br />
To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore, <br />
The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, <br />
And Phlegethon&#8217;s innavigable flood, <br />
And the black regions of his brother god. <br />
He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. <br />
And now at length the number&#8217;d hours were come, <br />
Prefix&#8217;d by fate&#8217;s irrevocable doom, <br />
When the great Mother of the Gods was free <br />
To save her ships, and finish Jove&#8217;s decree. <br />
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung <br />
A light that sign&#8217;d the heav&#8217;ns, and shot along; <br />
Then from a cloud, fring&#8217;d round with golden fires, <br />
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; <br />
And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, <br />
Both hosts, in arms oppos&#8217;d, with equal horror wounds: <br />
&#8220;O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, <br />
And know, my ships are my peculiar care. <br />
With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, <br />
With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, <br />
Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, <br />
Loos&#8217;d from your crooked anchors, launch at large, <br />
Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, <br />
And swim the seas, at Cybele&#8217;s command.&#8221; <br />
No sooner had the goddess ceas&#8217;d to speak, <br />
When, lo! th&#8217; obedient ships their haulsers break; <br />
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main <br />
They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: <br />
As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, <br />
As rode before tall vessels on the deep. <br />
The foes, surpris&#8217;d with wonder, stood aghast; <br />
Messapus curb&#8217;d his fiery courser&#8217;s haste; <br />
Old Tiber roar&#8217;d, and, raising up his head, <br />
Call&#8217;d back his waters to their oozy bed. <br />
Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, <br />
And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: <br />
&#8220;These monsters for the Trojans&#8217; fate are meant, <br />
And are by Jove for black presages sent. <br />
He takes the cowards&#8217; last relief away; <br />
For fly they cannot, and, constrain&#8217;d to stay, <br />
Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. <br />
The liquid half of all the globe is lost; <br />
Heav&#8217;n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast. <br />
Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground <br />
Which myriads of our martial men surround. <br />
Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles. <br />
&#8216;T was giv&#8217;n to Venus they should cross the seas, <br />
And land secure upon the Latian plains: <br />
Their promis&#8217;d hour is pass&#8217;d, and mine remains. <br />
&#8216;T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy, <br />
With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. <br />
Shall such affronts as these alone inflame <br />
The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name? <br />
My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, <br />
And final ruin, for a ravish&#8217;d wife. <br />
Was &#8216;t not enough, that, punish&#8217;d for the crime, <br />
They fell; but will they fall a second time? <br />
One would have thought they paid enough before, <br />
To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. <br />
Can they securely trust their feeble wall, <br />
A slight partition, a thin interval, <br />
Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho&#8217; built <br />
By hands divine, yet perish&#8217;d by their guilt? <br />
Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, <br />
To force from out their lines these dastard bands. <br />
Less than a thousand ships will end this war, <br />
Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. <br />
Let all the Tuscans, all th&#8217; Arcadians, join! <br />
Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. <br />
Let them not fear the treasons of the night, <br />
The robb&#8217;d Palladium, the pretended flight: <br />
Our onset shall be made in open light. <br />
No wooden engine shall their town betray; <br />
Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. <br />
No Grecian babes before their camp appear, <br />
Whom Hector&#8217;s arms detain&#8217;d to the tenth tardy year. <br />
Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, <br />
Give we the silent night to needful rest: <br />
Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; <br />
The morn shall end the small remains of war.&#8221; <br />
The post of honor to Messapus falls, <br />
To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, <br />
To pitch the fires at distances around, <br />
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. <br />
Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand, <br />
And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; <br />
All clad in shining arms the works invest, <br />
Each with a radiant helm and waving crest. <br />
Stretch&#8217;d at their length, they press the grassy ground; <br />
They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) <br />
With lights and cheerful fires renew the day, <br />
And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. <br />
The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld, <br />
And with arm&#8217;d legions all the rampires fill&#8217;d. <br />
Seiz&#8217;d with affright, their gates they first explore; <br />
Join works to works with bridges, tow&#8217;r to tow&#8217;r: <br />
Thus all things needful for defense abound. <br />
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round, <br />
Commission&#8217;d by their absent prince to share <br />
The common danger, and divide the care. <br />
The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, <br />
By turns relieve each other on the wall. <br />
Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, <br />
To watch the gate was warlike Nisus&#8217; chance. <br />
His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; <br />
His mother was a huntress of the wood, <br />
And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear <br />
His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, <br />
But better skill&#8217;d unerring shafts to send. <br />
Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: <br />
Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host <br />
No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast&#8211; <br />
Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. <br />
One was their care, and their delight was one: <br />
One common hazard in the war they shar&#8217;d, <br />
And now were both by choice upon the guard. <br />
Then Nisus thus: &#8220;Or do the gods inspire <br />
This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? <br />
A gen&#8217;rous ardor boils within my breast, <br />
Eager of action, enemy to rest: <br />
This urges me to fight, and fires my mind <br />
To leave a memorable name behind. <br />
Thou see&#8217;st the foe secure; how faintly shine <br />
Their scatter&#8217;d fires! the most, in sleep supine <br />
Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: <br />
The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; <br />
All hush&#8217;d around. Now hear what I revolve&#8211; <br />
A thought unripe&#8211;and scarcely yet resolve. <br />
Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; <br />
By message both would hasten his return: <br />
If they confer what I demand on thee, <br />
(For fame is recompense enough for me,) <br />
Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied <br />
A way that safely will my passage guide.&#8221; <br />
Euryalus stood list&#8217;ning while he spoke, <br />
With love of praise and noble envy struck; <br />
Then to his ardent friend expos&#8217;d his mind: <br />
&#8220;All this, alone, and leaving me behind! <br />
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join&#8217;d? <br />
Think&#8217;st thou I can my share of glory yield, <br />
Or send thee unassisted to the field? <br />
Not so my father taught my childhood arms; <br />
Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! <br />
Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, <br />
Nor of the heav&#8217;n-born hero I attend. <br />
The thing call&#8217;d life, with ease I can disclaim, <br />
And think it over-sold to purchase fame.&#8221; <br />
Then Nisus thus: &#8220;Alas! thy tender years <br />
Would minister new matter to my fears. <br />
So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, <br />
Restore me to thy lov&#8217;d embrace with life, <br />
Condemn&#8217;d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) <br />
This thy request is cruel and unjust. <br />
But if some chance&#8211;as many chances are, <br />
And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war&#8211; <br />
If one should reach my head, there let it fall, <br />
And spare thy life; I would not perish all. <br />
Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: <br />
Live thou to mourn thy love&#8217;s unhappy fate; <br />
To bear my mangled body from the foe, <br />
Or buy it back, and fun&#8217;ral rites bestow. <br />
Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, <br />
Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. <br />
O let not me the widow&#8217;s tears renew! <br />
Nor let a mother&#8217;s curse my name pursue: <br />
Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, <br />
Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, <br />
Her age committing to the seas and wind, <br />
When ev&#8217;ry weary matron stay&#8217;d behind.&#8221; <br />
To this, Euryalus: &#8220;You plead in vain, <br />
And but protract the cause you cannot gain. <br />
No more delays, but haste!&#8221; With that, he wakes <br />
The nodding watch; each to his office takes. <br />
The guard reliev&#8217;d, the gen&#8217;rous couple went <br />
To find the council at the royal tent. <br />
All creatures else forgot their daily care, <br />
And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; <br />
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate <br />
In nightly council for th&#8217; indanger&#8217;d state. <br />
They vote a message to their absent chief, <br />
Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. <br />
Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, <br />
Remote from clamor, and secure from foes. <br />
On their left arms their ample shields they bear, <br />
The right reclin&#8217;d upon the bending spear. <br />
Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, <br />
And beg admission, eager to be heard: <br />
Th&#8217; affair important, not to be deferr&#8217;d. <br />
Ascanius bids &#8216;em be conducted in, <br />
Ord&#8217;ring the more experienc&#8217;d to begin. <br />
Then Nisus thus: &#8220;Ye fathers, lend your ears; <br />
Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. <br />
The foe, securely drench&#8217;d in sleep and wine, <br />
Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; <br />
And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies, <br />
Cov&#8217;ring the plain, and curling to the skies, <br />
Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, <br />
Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, <br />
Which will our way to great AEneas guide. <br />
Expect each hour to see him safe again, <br />
Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. <br />
Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; <br />
Nor can we be mistaken in the way; <br />
For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen <br />
The rising turrets, and the stream between, <br />
And know the winding course, with ev&#8217;ry ford.&#8221; <br />
He ceas&#8217;d; and old Alethes took the word: <br />
&#8220;Our country gods, in whom our trust we place, <br />
Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, <br />
While we behold such dauntless worth appear <br />
In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.&#8221; <br />
Then into tears of joy the father broke; <br />
Each in his longing arms by turns he took; <br />
Panted and paus&#8217;d; and thus again he spoke: <br />
&#8220;Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we, <br />
In recompense of such desert, decree? <br />
The greatest, sure, and best you can receive, <br />
The gods and your own conscious worth will give. <br />
The rest our grateful gen&#8217;ral will bestow, <br />
And young Ascanius till his manhood owe.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;And I, whose welfare in my father lies,&#8221; <br />
Ascanius adds, &#8220;by the great deities, <br />
By my dear country, by my household gods, <br />
By hoary Vesta&#8217;s rites and dark abodes, <br />
Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; <br />
That and my faith I plight into your hands,) <br />
Make me but happy in his safe return, <br />
Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; <br />
Your common gift shall two large goblets be <br />
Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, <br />
And high emboss&#8217;d, which, when old Priam reign&#8217;d, <br />
My conqu&#8217;ring sire at sack&#8217;d Arisba gain&#8217;d; <br />
And more, two tripods cast in antic mold, <br />
With two great talents of the finest gold; <br />
Beside a costly bowl, ingrav&#8217;d with art, <br />
Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. <br />
But, if in conquer&#8217;d Italy we reign, <br />
When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain&#8211; <br />
Thou saw&#8217;st the courser by proud Turnus press&#8217;d: <br />
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, <br />
And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share: <br />
Twelve lab&#8217;ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair, <br />
All clad in rich attire, and train&#8217;d with care; <br />
And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, <br />
And a large portion of the king&#8217;s domains. <br />
But thou, whose years are more to mine allied&#8211; <br />
No fate my vow&#8217;d affection shall divide <br />
From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; <br />
Take full possession; all my soul is thine. <br />
One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend; <br />
My life&#8217;s companion, and my bosom friend: <br />
My peace shall be committed to thy care, <br />
And to thy conduct my concerns in war.&#8221; <br />
Then thus the young Euryalus replied: <br />
&#8220;Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide, <br />
The same shall be my age, as now my youth; <br />
No time shall find me wanting to my truth. <br />
This only from your goodness let me gain <br />
(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain): <br />
Of Priam&#8217;s royal race my mother came&#8211; <br />
And sure the best that ever bore the name&#8211; <br />
Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold <br />
From me departing, but, o&#8217;erspent and old, <br />
My fate she follow&#8217;d. Ignorant of this <br />
(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss, <br />
Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave, <br />
And in this only act of all my life deceive. <br />
By this right hand and conscious Night I swear, <br />
My soul so sad a farewell could not bear. <br />
Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place <br />
(Permit me to presume so great a grace); <br />
Support her age, forsaken and distress&#8217;d. <br />
That hope alone will fortify my breast <br />
Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears.&#8221; <br />
He said. The mov&#8217;d assistants melt in tears. <br />
Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see <br />
That image of his filial piety: <br />
&#8220;So great beginnings, in so green an age, <br />
Exact the faith which I again ingage. <br />
Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim, <br />
Creusa had, and only want the name. <br />
Whate&#8217;er event thy bold attempt shall have, <br />
&#8216;T is merit to have borne a son so brave. <br />
Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear, <br />
(My father us&#8217;d it,) what, returning here <br />
Crown&#8217;d with success, I for thyself prepare, <br />
That, if thou fail, shall thy lov&#8217;d mother share.&#8221; <br />
He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word, <br />
From his broad belt he drew a shining sword, <br />
Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made, <br />
And in an iv&#8217;ry scabbard sheath&#8217;d the blade. <br />
This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend <br />
A lion&#8217;s hide, his body to defend; <br />
And good Alethes furnish&#8217;d him, beside, <br />
With his own trusty helm, of temper tried. <br />
Thus arm&#8217;d they went. The noble Trojans wait <br />
Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate <br />
With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears <br />
Ascanius, manly far beyond his years, <br />
And messages committed to their care, <br />
Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air. <br />
The trenches first they pass&#8217;d; then took their way <br />
Where their proud foes in pitch&#8217;d pavilions lay; <br />
To many fatal, ere themselves were slain. <br />
They found the careless host dispers&#8217;d upon the plain, <br />
Who, gorg&#8217;d, and drunk with wine, supinely snore. <br />
Unharnass&#8217;d chariots stand along the shore: <br />
Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, <br />
A medley of debauch and war, they lie. <br />
Observing Nisus shew&#8217;d his friend the sight: <br />
&#8220;Behold a conquest gain&#8217;d without a fight. <br />
Occasion offers, and I stand prepar&#8217;d; <br />
There lies our way; be thou upon the guard, <br />
And look around, while I securely go, <br />
And hew a passage thro&#8217; the sleeping foe.&#8221; <br />
Softly he spoke; then striding took his way, <br />
With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; <br />
His head rais&#8217;d high on tapestry beneath, <br />
And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath; <br />
A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov&#8217;d: <br />
But fate by prescience cannot be remov&#8217;d. <br />
Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies <br />
Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. <br />
His armor-bearer first, and next he kills <br />
His charioteer, intrench&#8217;d betwixt the wheels <br />
And his lov&#8217;d horses; last invades their lord; <br />
Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: <br />
The gasping head flies off; a purple flood <br />
Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, <br />
Which, by the spurning heels dispers&#8217;d around, <br />
The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. <br />
Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, <br />
He slew, and then Serranus fair and young. <br />
From dice and wine the youth retir&#8217;d to rest, <br />
And puff&#8217;d the fumy god from out his breast: <br />
Ev&#8217;n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play&#8211; <br />
More lucky, had it lasted till the day. <br />
The famish&#8217;d lion thus, with hunger bold, <br />
O&#8217;erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, <br />
And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe <br />
Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. <br />
Nor with less rage Euryalus employs <br />
The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys; <br />
But on th&#8217; ignoble crowd his fury flew; <br />
He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew. <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with heavy sleep the former fell, <br />
But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all: <br />
Behind a spacious jar he slink&#8217;d for fear; <br />
The fatal iron found and reach&#8217;d him there; <br />
For, as he rose, it pierc&#8217;d his naked side, <br />
And, reeking, thence return&#8217;d in crimson dyed. <br />
The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood; <br />
The purple soul comes floating in the flood. <br />
Now, where Messapus quarter&#8217;d, they arrive. <br />
The fires were fainting there, and just alive; <br />
The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. <br />
Nisus observ&#8217;d the discipline, and said: <br />
&#8220;Our eager thirst of blood may both betray; <br />
And see the scatter&#8217;d streaks of dawning day, <br />
Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend; <br />
Here let our glutted execution end. <br />
A lane thro&#8217; slaughter&#8217;d bodies we have made.&#8221; <br />
The bold Euryalus, tho&#8217; loth, obey&#8217;d. <br />
Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find <br />
A precious load; but these they leave behind. <br />
Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay <br />
To make the rich caparison his prey, <br />
Which on the steed of conquer&#8217;d Rhamnes lay. <br />
Nor did his eyes less longingly behold <br />
The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish&#8217;d gold. <br />
This present Caedicus the rich bestow&#8217;d <br />
On Remulus, when friendship first they vow&#8217;d, <br />
And, absent, join&#8217;d in hospitable ties: <br />
He, dying, to his heir bequeath&#8217;d the prize; <br />
Till, by the conqu&#8217;ring Ardean troops oppress&#8217;d, <br />
He fell; and they the glorious gift possess&#8217;d. <br />
These glitt&#8217;ring spoils (now made the victor&#8217;s gain) <br />
He to his body suits, but suits in vain: <br />
Messapus&#8217; helm he finds among the rest, <br />
And laces on, and wears the waving crest. <br />
Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey, <br />
They leave the camp, and take the ready way. <br />
But far they had not pass&#8217;d, before they spied <br />
Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide. <br />
The queen a legion to King Turnus sent; <br />
But the swift horse the slower foot prevent, <br />
And now, advancing, sought the leader&#8217;s tent. <br />
They saw the pair; for, thro&#8217; the doubtful shade, <br />
His shining helm Euryalus betray&#8217;d, <br />
On which the moon with full reflection play&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;T is not for naught,&#8221; cried Volscens from the crowd, <br />
&#8220;These men go there;&#8221; then rais&#8217;d his voice aloud: <br />
&#8220;Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? <br />
From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?&#8221; <br />
Silent they scud away, and haste their flight <br />
To neighb&#8217;ring woods, and trust themselves to night. <br />
The speedy horse all passages belay, <br />
And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, <br />
And watch each entrance of the winding wood. <br />
Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood, <br />
Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; <br />
Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn. <br />
The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, <br />
And fear, misled the younger from his way. <br />
But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste, <br />
And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass&#8217;d, <br />
And Alban plains, from Alba&#8217;s name so call&#8217;d, <br />
Where King Latinus then his oxen stall&#8217;d; <br />
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, <br />
And miss&#8217;d his friend, and cast his eyes around: <br />
&#8220;Ah wretch!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;where have I left behind <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? <br />
Or what way take?&#8221; Again he ventures back, <br />
And treads the mazes of his former track. <br />
He winds the wood, and, list&#8217;ning, hears the noise <br />
Of tramping coursers, and the riders&#8217; voice. <br />
The sound approach&#8217;d; and suddenly he view&#8217;d <br />
The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued, <br />
Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain <br />
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain. <br />
What should he next attempt? what arms employ, <br />
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? <br />
Or desperate should he rush and lose his life, <br />
With odds oppress&#8217;d, in such unequal strife? <br />
Resolv&#8217;d at length, his pointed spear he shook; <br />
And, casting on the moon a mournful look: <br />
&#8220;Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night, <br />
Fair queen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;direct my dart aright. <br />
If e&#8217;er my pious father, for my sake, <br />
Did grateful off&#8217;rings on thy altars make, <br />
Or I increas&#8217;d them with my sylvan toils, <br />
And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, <br />
Give me to scatter these.&#8221; Then from his ear <br />
He pois&#8217;d, and aim&#8217;d, and launch&#8217;d the trembling spear. <br />
The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, <br />
Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; <br />
Pierc&#8217;d his thin armor, drank his vital blood, <br />
And in his body left the broken wood. <br />
He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, <br />
And with short sobs he gasps away his breath. <br />
All stand amaz&#8217;d&#8211;a second jav&#8217;lin flies <br />
With equal strength, and quivers thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
This thro&#8217; thy temples, Tagus, forc&#8217;d the way, <br />
And in the brainpan warmly buried lay. <br />
Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round, <br />
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound, <br />
Nor knew to fix revenge: &#8220;But thou,&#8221; he cries, <br />
&#8220;Shalt pay for both,&#8221; and at the pris&#8217;ner flies <br />
With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair, <br />
That cruel sight the lover could not bear; <br />
But from his covert rush&#8217;d in open view, <br />
And sent his voice before him as he flew: <br />
&#8220;Me! me!&#8221; he cried&#8211;&#8221;turn all your swords alone <br />
On me&#8211;the fact confess&#8217;d, the fault my own. <br />
He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth: <br />
Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! <br />
His only crime (if friendship can offend) <br />
Is too much love to his unhappy friend.&#8221; <br />
Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides, <br />
Driv&#8217;n with full force, had pierc&#8217;d his tender sides. <br />
Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound <br />
Gush&#8217;d out a purple stream, and stain&#8217;d the ground. <br />
His snowy neck reclines upon his breast, <br />
Like a fair flow&#8217;r by the keen share oppress&#8217;d; <br />
Like a white poppy sinking on the plain, <br />
Whose heavy head is overcharg&#8217;d with rain. <br />
Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow&#8217;d, <br />
Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. <br />
Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: <br />
Borne back and bor&#8217;d by his surrounding friends, <br />
Onward he press&#8217;d, and kept him still in sight; <br />
Then whirl&#8217;d aloft his sword with all his might: <br />
Th&#8217; unerring steel descended while he spoke, <br />
Pierc&#8217;d his wide mouth, and thro&#8217; his weazon broke. <br />
Dying, he slew; and, stagg&#8217;ring on the plain, <br />
With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain; <br />
Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, <br />
Content, in death, to be reveng&#8217;d so well. <br />
O happy friends! for, if my verse can give <br />
Immortal life, your fame shall ever live, <br />
Fix&#8217;d as the Capitol&#8217;s foundation lies, <br />
And spread, where&#8217;er the Roman eagle flies! <br />
The conqu&#8217;ring party first divide the prey, <br />
Then their slain leader to the camp convey. <br />
With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill&#8217;d, <br />
To see such numbers whom so few had kill&#8217;d. <br />
Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found: <br />
Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround; <br />
And the yet reeking blood o&#8217;erflows the ground. <br />
All knew the helmet which Messapus lost, <br />
But mourn&#8217;d a purchase that so dear had cost. <br />
Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon&#8217;s bed, <br />
And with the dawn of day the skies o&#8217;erspread; <br />
Nor long the sun his daily course withheld, <br />
But added colors to the world reveal&#8217;d: <br />
When early Turnus, wak&#8217;ning with the light, <br />
All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight. <br />
His martial men with fierce harangue he fir&#8217;d, <br />
And his own ardor in their souls inspir&#8217;d. <br />
This done&#8211;to give new terror to his foes, <br />
The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows, <br />
Rais&#8217;d high on pointed spears&#8211;a ghastly sight: <br />
Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. <br />
Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls; <br />
They line their trenches, and they man their walls. <br />
In front extended to the left they stood; <br />
Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood. <br />
But, casting from their tow&#8217;rs a frightful view, <br />
They saw the faces, which too well they knew, <br />
Tho&#8217; then disguis&#8217;d in death, and smear&#8217;d all o&#8217;er <br />
With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore. <br />
Soon hasty fame thro&#8217; the sad city bears <br />
The mournful message to the mother&#8217;s ears. <br />
An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; <br />
Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes. <br />
She runs the rampires round amidst the war, <br />
Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair, <br />
And fills with loud laments the liquid air. <br />
&#8220;Thus, then, my lov&#8217;d Euryalus appears! <br />
Thus looks the prop of my declining years! <br />
Was&#8217;t on this face my famish&#8217;d eyes I fed? <br />
Ah! how unlike the living is the dead! <br />
And could&#8217;st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? <br />
Not one kind kiss from a departing son! <br />
No look, no last adieu before he went, <br />
In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! <br />
Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay, <br />
To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey! <br />
Nor was I near to close his dying eyes, <br />
To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, <br />
To call about his corpse his crying friends, <br />
Or spread the mantle (made for other ends) <br />
On his dear body, which I wove with care, <br />
Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare. <br />
Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains <br />
His trunk dismember&#8217;d, and his cold remains? <br />
For this, alas! I left my needful ease, <br />
Expos&#8217;d my life to winds and winter seas! <br />
If any pity touch Rutulian hearts, <br />
Here empty all your quivers, all your darts; <br />
Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe, <br />
And send me thunderstruck to shades below!&#8221; <br />
Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans&#8217; ears, <br />
Unman their courage, and augment their fears; <br />
Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain, <br />
Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain, <br />
But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent, <br />
To bear the madding mother to her tent. <br />
And now the trumpets terribly, from far, <br />
With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war. <br />
The soldiers&#8217; shouts succeed the brazen sounds; <br />
And heav&#8217;n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. <br />
The Volscians bear their shields upon their head, <br />
And, rushing forward, form a moving shed. <br />
These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down: <br />
Some raise the ladders; others scale the town. <br />
But, where void spaces on the walls appear, <br />
Or thin defense, they pour their forces there. <br />
With poles and missive weapons, from afar, <br />
The Trojans keep aloof the rising war. <br />
Taught, by their ten years&#8217; siege, defensive fight, <br />
They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight, <br />
To break the penthouse with the pond&#8217;rous blow, <br />
Which yet the patient Volscians undergo: <br />
But could not bear th&#8217; unequal combat long; <br />
For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng, <br />
The ruin falls: their shatter&#8217;d shields give way, <br />
And their crush&#8217;d heads become an easy prey. <br />
They shrink for fear, abated of their rage, <br />
Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage; <br />
Contented now to gall them from below <br />
With darts and slings, and with the distant bow. <br />
Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view, <br />
A blazing pine within the trenches threw. <br />
But brave Messapus, Neptune&#8217;s warlike son, <br />
Broke down the palisades, the trenches won, <br />
And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. <br />
Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine, <br />
Inspire your poet in his high design, <br />
To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made, <br />
What souls he sent below the Stygian shade, <br />
What fame the soldiers with their captain share, <br />
And the vast circuit of the fatal war; <br />
For you in singing martial facts excel; <br />
You best remember, and alone can tell. <br />
There stood a tow&#8217;r, amazing to the sight, <br />
Built up of beams, and of stupendous height: <br />
Art, and the nature of the place, conspir&#8217;d <br />
To furnish all the strength that war requir&#8217;d. <br />
To level this, the bold Italians join; <br />
The wary Trojans obviate their design; <br />
With weighty stones o&#8217;erwhelm their troops below, <br />
Shoot thro&#8217; the loopholes, and sharp jav&#8217;lins throw. <br />
Turnus, the chief, toss&#8217;d from his thund&#8217;ring hand <br />
Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: <br />
It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; <br />
The planks were season&#8217;d, and the timber dry. <br />
Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, <br />
Scorch&#8217;d, and to distance drove the scatter&#8217;d throng. <br />
The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, <br />
Still gath&#8217;ring fast upon the trembling train; <br />
Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, <br />
Down the defense and the defenders fall. <br />
The mighty flaw makes heav&#8217;n itself resound: <br />
The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. <br />
The tow&#8217;r, that follow&#8217;d on the fallen crew, <br />
Whelm&#8217;d o&#8217;er their heads, and buried whom it slew: <br />
Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; <br />
All the same equal ruin underwent. <br />
Young Lycus and Helenor only scape; <br />
Sav&#8217;d&#8211;how, they know not&#8211;from the steepy leap. <br />
Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, <br />
On one side royal, one a son of earth, <br />
Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, <br />
And sent her boasted bastard to the war <br />
(A privilege which none but freemen share). <br />
Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: <br />
No marks of honor charg&#8217;d its empty field. <br />
Light as he fell, so light the youth arose, <br />
And rising, found himself amidst his foes; <br />
Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way. <br />
Embolden&#8217;d by despair, he stood at bay; <br />
And&#8211;like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds <br />
Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds&#8211; <br />
Resolv&#8217;d on death, he dissipates his fears, <br />
And bounds aloft against the pointed spears: <br />
So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws <br />
His dying body on his thickest foes. <br />
But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far, <br />
Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war; <br />
Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind, <br />
And snatches at the beam he first can find; <br />
Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, <br />
In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach <br />
But Turnus follow&#8217;d hard his hunted prey <br />
(His spear had almost reach&#8217;d him in the way, <br />
Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind): <br />
&#8220;Fool!&#8221; said the chief, &#8220;tho&#8217; fleeter than the wind, <br />
Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?&#8221; <br />
He said, and downward by the feet he drew <br />
The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls; <br />
Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls. <br />
Thus on some silver swan, or tim&#8217;rous hare, <br />
Jove&#8217;s bird comes sousing down from upper air; <br />
Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey: <br />
Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way. <br />
So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb, <br />
In vain lamented by the bleating dam. <br />
Then rushing onward with a barb&#8217;rous cry, <br />
The troops of Turnus to the combat fly. <br />
The ditch with fagots fill&#8217;d, the daring foe <br />
Toss&#8217;d firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. <br />
Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came <br />
To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame, <br />
Roll&#8217;d down the fragment of a rock so right, <br />
It crush&#8217;d him double underneath the weight. <br />
Two more young Liger and Asylas slew: <br />
To bend the bow young Liger better knew; <br />
Asylas best the pointed jav&#8217;lin threw. <br />
Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain; <br />
The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain. <br />
By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall, <br />
Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall. <br />
From Capys&#8217; arms his fate Privernus found: <br />
Hurt by Themilla first&#8211;but slight the wound&#8211; <br />
His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, <br />
He clapp&#8217;d his hand upon the wounded part: <br />
The second shaft came swift and unespied, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d his hand, and nail&#8217;d it to his side, <br />
Transfix&#8217;d his breathing lungs and beating heart: <br />
The soul came issuing out, and hiss&#8217;d against the dart. <br />
The son of Arcens shone amid the rest, <br />
In glitt&#8217;ring armor and a purple vest, <br />
(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,) <br />
Bred by his father in the Martian grove, <br />
Where the fat altars of Palicus flame, <br />
And sent in arms to purchase early fame. <br />
Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king <br />
Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling, <br />
Thrice whirl&#8217;d the thong around his head, and threw: <br />
The heated lead half melted as it flew; <br />
It pierc&#8217;d his hollow temples and his brain; <br />
The youth came tumbling down, and spurn&#8217;d the plain. <br />
Then young Ascanius, who, before this day, <br />
Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, <br />
First bent in martial strife the twanging bow, <br />
And exercis&#8217;d against a human foe&#8211; <br />
With this bereft Numanus of his life, <br />
Who Turnus&#8217; younger sister took to wife. <br />
Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride, <br />
Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen&#8217;d with a stride, <br />
In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied: <br />
&#8216;Twice-conquer&#8217;d cowards, now your shame is shown&#8211; <br />
Coop&#8217;d up a second time within your town! <br />
Who dare not issue forth in open field, <br />
But hold your walls before you for a shield. <br />
Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force? <br />
What gods, what madness, hether steer&#8217;d your course? <br />
You shall not find the sons of Atreus here, <br />
Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. <br />
Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, <br />
We bear our newborn infants to the flood; <br />
There bath&#8217;d amid the stream, our boys we hold, <br />
With winter harden&#8217;d, and inur&#8217;d to cold. <br />
They wake before the day to range the wood, <br />
Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer&#8217;d food. <br />
No sports, but what belong to war, they know: <br />
To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. <br />
Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread; <br />
Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed. <br />
From plows and harrows sent to seek renown, <br />
They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. <br />
No part of life from toils of war is free, <br />
No change in age, or diff&#8217;rence in degree. <br />
We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel, <br />
Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel; <br />
Th&#8217; inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. <br />
Ev&#8217;n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain: <br />
The body, not the mind; nor can control <br />
Th&#8217; immortal vigor, or abate the soul. <br />
Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray: <br />
We live by plunder, and delight in prey. <br />
Your vests embroider&#8217;d with rich purple shine; <br />
In sloth you glory, and in dances join. <br />
Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride <br />
Your turbants underneath your chins are tied. <br />
Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! <br />
Go, less than women, in the shapes of men! <br />
Go, mix&#8217;d with eunuchs, in the Mother&#8217;s rites, <br />
Where with unequal sound the flute invites; <br />
Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida&#8217;s shade: <br />
Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!&#8221; <br />
This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear <br />
With patience, or a vow&#8217;d revenge forbear. <br />
At the full stretch of both his hands he drew, <br />
And almost join&#8217;d the horns of the tough yew. <br />
But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, <br />
And thus with lifted hands invok&#8217;d the god: <br />
&#8220;My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! <br />
An annual off&#8217;ring in thy grove shall bleed; <br />
A snow-white steer, before thy altar led, <br />
Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, <br />
Butts with his threat&#8217;ning brows, and bellowing stands, <br />
And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.&#8221; <br />
Jove bow&#8217;d the heav&#8217;ns, and lent a gracious ear, <br />
And thunder&#8217;d on the left, amidst the clear. <br />
Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies <br />
The feather&#8217;d death, and hisses thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
The steel thro&#8217; both his temples forc&#8217;d the way: <br />
Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. <br />
&#8220;Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn! <br />
The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.&#8221; <br />
Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake <br />
The heav&#8217;ns with shouting, and new vigor take. <br />
Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, <br />
To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; <br />
And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: <br />
&#8220;Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, <br />
And wide from east to west extend thy name; <br />
Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe <br />
To thee a race of demigods below. <br />
This is the way to heav&#8217;n: the pow&#8217;rs divine <br />
From this beginning date the Julian line. <br />
To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, <br />
The conquer&#8217;d war is due, and the vast world is theirs. <br />
Troy is too narrow for thy name.&#8221; He said, <br />
And plunging downward shot his radiant head; <br />
Dispell&#8217;d the breathing air, that broke his flight: <br />
Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. <br />
Old Butes&#8217; form he took, Anchises&#8217; squire, <br />
Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: <br />
His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, <br />
His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, <br />
And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: <br />
&#8220;Suffice it thee, thy father&#8217;s worthy son, <br />
The warlike prize thou hast already won. <br />
The god of archers gives thy youth a part <br />
Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. <br />
Now tempt the war no more.&#8221; He said, and flew <br />
Obscure in air, and vanish&#8217;d from their view. <br />
The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know, <br />
And hear the twanging of his heav&#8217;nly bow. <br />
Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus&#8217; name, <br />
To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame. <br />
Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun; <br />
From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run. <br />
They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around; <br />
Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; <br />
And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound. <br />
The combat thickens, like the storm that flies <br />
From westward, when the show&#8217;ry Kids arise; <br />
Or patt&#8217;ring hail comes pouring on the main, <br />
When Jupiter descends in harden&#8217;d rain, <br />
Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, <br />
And with an armed winter strew the ground. <br />
Pand&#8217;rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war, <br />
Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare <br />
On Ida&#8217;s top, two youths of height and size <br />
Like firs that on their mother mountain rise, <br />
Presuming on their force, the gates unbar, <br />
And of their own accord invite the war. <br />
With fates averse, against their king&#8217;s command, <br />
Arm&#8217;d, on the right and on the left they stand, <br />
And flank the passage: shining steel they wear, <br />
And waving crests above their heads appear. <br />
Thus two tall oaks, that Padus&#8217; banks adorn, <br />
Lift up to heav&#8217;n their leafy heads unshorn, <br />
And, overpress&#8217;d with nature&#8217;s heavy load, <br />
Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. <br />
In flows a tide of Latians, when they see <br />
The gate set open, and the passage free; <br />
Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on, <br />
Equicolus, that in bright armor shone, <br />
And Haemon first; but soon repuls&#8217;d they fly, <br />
Or in the well-defended pass they die. <br />
These with success are fir&#8217;d, and those with rage, <br />
And each on equal terms at length ingage. <br />
Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, <br />
The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. <br />
Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, <br />
When suddenly th&#8217; unhop&#8217;d-for news was brought, <br />
The foes had left the fastness of their place, <br />
Prevail&#8217;d in fight, and had his men in chase. <br />
He quits th&#8217; attack, and, to prevent their fate, <br />
Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate. <br />
The first he met, Antiphates the brave, <br />
But base-begotten on a Theban slave, <br />
Sarpedon&#8217;s son, he slew: the deadly dart <br />
Found passage thro&#8217; his breast, and pierc&#8217;d his heart. <br />
Fix&#8217;d in the wound th&#8217; Italian cornel stood, <br />
Warm&#8217;d in his lungs, and in his vital blood. <br />
Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, <br />
And Meropes, and the gigantic size <br />
Of Bitias, threat&#8217;ning with his ardent eyes. <br />
Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress&#8217;d <br />
(A dart were lost within that roomy breast), <br />
But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, <br />
Which roar&#8217;d like thunder as it whirl&#8217;d along: <br />
Not two bull hides th&#8217; impetuous force withhold, <br />
Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. <br />
Down sunk the monster bulk and press&#8217;d the ground; <br />
His arms and clatt&#8217;ring shield on the vast body sound, <br />
Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole, <br />
Rais&#8217;d on the seas, the surges to control&#8211; <br />
At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; <br />
Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall <br />
Of the vast pile; the scatter&#8217;d ocean flies; <br />
Black sands, discolor&#8217;d froth, and mingled mud arise: <br />
The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores; <br />
Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: <br />
Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove&#8217;s command, <br />
Astonish&#8217;d at the flaw that shakes the land, <br />
Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, <br />
With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back. <br />
The warrior god the Latian troops inspir&#8217;d, <br />
New strung their sinews, and their courage fir&#8217;d, <br />
But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright: <br />
Then black despair precipitates their flight. <br />
When Pandarus beheld his brother kill&#8217;d, <br />
The town with fear and wild confusion fill&#8217;d, <br />
He turns the hinges of the heavy gate <br />
With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight; <br />
Some happier friends within the walls inclos&#8217;d; <br />
The rest shut out, to certain death expos&#8217;d: <br />
Fool as he was, and frantic in his care, <br />
T&#8217; admit young Turnus, and include the war! <br />
He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold, <br />
Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. <br />
Too late his blazing buckler they descry, <br />
And sparkling fires that shot from either eye, <br />
His mighty members, and his ample breast, <br />
His rattling armor, and his crimson crest. <br />
Far from that hated face the Trojans fly, <br />
All but the fool who sought his destiny. <br />
Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow&#8217;d <br />
For Bitias&#8217; death, and threatens thus aloud: <br />
&#8220;These are not Ardea&#8217;s walls, nor this the town <br />
Amata proffers with Lavinia&#8217;s crown: <br />
&#8216;T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft, <br />
No means of safe return by flight are left.&#8221; <br />
To whom, with count&#8217;nance calm, and soul sedate, <br />
Thus Turnus: &#8220;Then begin, and try thy fate: <br />
My message to the ghost of Priam bear; <br />
Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there.&#8221; <br />
A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw, <br />
Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew: <br />
With his full force he whirl&#8217;d it first around; <br />
But the soft yielding air receiv&#8217;d the wound: <br />
Imperial Juno turn&#8217;d the course before, <br />
And fix&#8217;d the wand&#8217;ring weapon in the door. <br />
&#8220;But hope not thou,&#8221; said Turnus, &#8220;when I strike, <br />
To shun thy fate: our force is not alike, <br />
Nor thy steel temper&#8217;d by the Lemnian god.&#8221; <br />
Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood, <br />
And aim&#8217;d from high: the full descending blow <br />
Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two. <br />
Down sinks the giant with a thund&#8217;ring sound: <br />
His pond&#8217;rous limbs oppress the trembling ground; <br />
Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound: <br />
Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides, <br />
And the shar&#8217;d visage hangs on equal sides. <br />
The Trojans fly from their approaching fate; <br />
And, had the victor then secur&#8217;d the gate, <br />
And to his troops without unclos&#8217;d the bars, <br />
One lucky day had ended all his wars. <br />
But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood, <br />
Push&#8217;d on his fury, to pursue the crowd. <br />
Hamstring&#8217;d behind, unhappy Gyges died; <br />
Then Phalaris is added to his side. <br />
The pointed jav&#8217;lins from the dead he drew, <br />
And their friends&#8217; arms against their fellows threw. <br />
Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies; <br />
Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies. <br />
Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall&#8211; <br />
Ingag&#8217;d against the foes who scal&#8217;d the wall: <br />
But, whom they fear&#8217;d without, they found within. <br />
At last, tho&#8217; late, by Lynceus he was seen. <br />
He calls new succors, and assaults the prince: <br />
But weak his force, and vain is their defense. <br />
Turn&#8217;d to the right, his sword the hero drew, <br />
And at one blow the bold aggressor slew. <br />
He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong, <br />
The helm flies off, and bears the head along. <br />
Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill&#8217;d, <br />
In darts invenom&#8217;d and in poison skill&#8217;d. <br />
Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear, <br />
And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear: <br />
He fought with courage, and he sung the fight; <br />
Arms were his bus&#8217;ness, verses his delight. <br />
The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief, <br />
Their slaughter&#8217;d friends, and hasten their relief. <br />
Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train, <br />
Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain. <br />
To save the living, and revenge the dead, <br />
Against one warrior&#8217;s arms all Troy they led. <br />
&#8220;O, void of sense and courage!&#8221; Mnestheus cried, <br />
&#8220;Where can you hope your coward heads to hide? <br />
Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run? <br />
One man, and in your camp inclos&#8217;d, you shun! <br />
Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast, <br />
And pass unpunish&#8217;d from a num&#8217;rous host? <br />
Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame, <br />
Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!&#8221; <br />
This just reproach their virtue does excite: <br />
They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight. <br />
Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield, <br />
But with slow paces measures back the field, <br />
And inches to the walls, where Tiber&#8217;s tide, <br />
Washing the camp, defends the weaker side. <br />
The more he loses, they advance the more, <br />
And tread in ev&#8217;ry step he trod before. <br />
They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might <br />
They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight. <br />
As, compass&#8217;d with a wood of spears around, <br />
The lordly lion still maintains his ground; <br />
Grins horrible, retires, and turns again; <br />
Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane; <br />
He loses while in vain he presses on, <br />
Nor will his courage let him dare to run: <br />
So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, <br />
Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight. <br />
Yet twice, inrag&#8217;d, the combat he renews, <br />
Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. <br />
But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied, <br />
Come rolling on, and rush from ev&#8217;ry side: <br />
Nor Juno, who sustain&#8217;d his arms before, <br />
Dares with new strength suffice th&#8217; exhausted store; <br />
For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down, <br />
To force th&#8217; invader from the frighted town. <br />
With labor spent, no longer can he wield <br />
The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield, <br />
O&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d with darts, which from afar they fling: <br />
The weapons round his hollow temples ring; <br />
His golden helm gives way, with stony blows <br />
Batter&#8217;d, and flat, and beaten to his brows. <br />
His crest is rash&#8217;d away; his ample shield <br />
Is falsified, and round with jav&#8217;lins fill&#8217;d. <br />
The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm; <br />
And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm. <br />
Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev&#8217;ry pore; <br />
With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o&#8217;er; <br />
Shorter and shorter ev&#8217;ry gasp he takes; <br />
And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes. <br />
Plung&#8217;d in the flood, and made the waters fly. <br />
The yellow god the welcome burthen bore, <br />
And wip&#8217;d the sweat, and wash&#8217;d away the gore; <br />
Then gently wafts him to the farther coast, <br />
And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.</p>
