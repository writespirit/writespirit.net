				<p>THE THIRD BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; AEneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an ac-<br />
count of the fleet with which he sail&#8217;d, and the success of his first<br />
voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos, and<br />
asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation.<br />
By a mistake of the oracle&#8217;s answer, he settles in Crete; his house-<br />
hold gods give him the true sense of the oracle, in a dream. He<br />
follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He<br />
is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures,<br />
till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies.<br />
This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose,<br />
and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;WHEN Heav&#8217;n had overturn&#8217;d the Trojan state <br />
And Priam&#8217;s throne, by too severe a fate; <br />
When ruin&#8217;d Troy became the Grecians&#8217; prey, <br />
And Ilium&#8217;s lofty tow&#8217;rs in ashes lay; <br />
Warn&#8217;d by celestial omens, we retreat, <br />
To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. <br />
Near old Antandros, and at Ida&#8217;s foot, <br />
The timber of the sacred groves we cut, <br />
And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find <br />
What place the gods for our repose assign&#8217;d. <br />
Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring <br />
Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, <br />
When old Anchises summon&#8217;d all to sea: <br />
The crew my father and the Fates obey. <br />
With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, <br />
And empty fields, where Ilium stood before. <br />
My sire, my son, our less and greater gods, <br />
All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. <br />
&#8220;Against our coast appears a spacious land, <br />
Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command, <br />
(Thracia the name&#8211;the people bold in war; <br />
Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,) <br />
A hospitable realm while Fate was kind, <br />
With Troy in friendship and religion join&#8217;d. <br />
I land; with luckless omens then adore <br />
Their gods, and draw a line along the shore; <br />
I lay the deep foundations of a wall, <br />
And AEnos, nam&#8217;d from me, the city call. <br />
To Dionaean Venus vows are paid, <br />
And all the pow&#8217;rs that rising labors aid; <br />
A bull on Jove&#8217;s imperial altar laid. <br />
Not far, a rising hillock stood in view; <br />
Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew. <br />
There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes, <br />
And shade our altar with their leafy greens, <br />
I pull&#8217;d a plant&#8211;with horror I relate <br />
A prodigy so strange and full of fate. <br />
The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound <br />
Black bloody drops distill&#8217;d upon the ground. <br />
Mute and amaz&#8217;d, my hair with terror stood; <br />
Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal&#8217;d my blood. <br />
Mann&#8217;d once again, another plant I try: <br />
That other gush&#8217;d with the same sanguine dye. <br />
Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown, <br />
With pray&#8217;rs and vows the Dryads I atone, <br />
With all the sisters of the woods, and most <br />
The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast, <br />
That they, or he, these omens would avert, <br />
Release our fears, and better signs impart. <br />
Clear&#8217;d, as I thought, and fully fix&#8217;d at length <br />
To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength: <br />
I bent my knees against the ground; once more <br />
The violated myrtle ran with gore. <br />
Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb <br />
Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, <br />
A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew&#8217;d <br />
My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued: <br />
&#8216;Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? <br />
O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! <br />
Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood: <br />
The tears distil not from the wounded wood; <br />
But ev&#8217;ry drop this living tree contains <br />
Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. <br />
O fly from this unhospitable shore, <br />
Warn&#8217;d by my fate; for I am Polydore! <br />
Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued, <br />
Again shoot upward, by my blood renew&#8217;d.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;My falt&#8217;ring tongue and shiv&#8217;ring limbs declare <br />
My horror, and in bristles rose my hair. <br />
When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, <br />
Old Priam, fearful of the war&#8217;s event, <br />
This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: <br />
Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far <br />
From noise and tumults, and destructive war, <br />
Committed to the faithless tyrant&#8217;s care; <br />
Who, when he saw the pow&#8217;r of Troy decline, <br />
Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join; <br />
Broke ev&#8217;ry bond of nature and of truth, <br />
And murder&#8217;d, for his wealth, the royal youth. <br />
O sacred hunger of pernicious gold! <br />
What bands of faith can impious lucre hold? <br />
Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, <br />
I call my father and the Trojan peers; <br />
Relate the prodigies of Heav&#8217;n, require <br />
What he commands, and their advice desire. <br />
All vote to leave that execrable shore, <br />
Polluted with the blood of Polydore; <br />
But, ere we sail, his fun&#8217;ral rites prepare, <br />
Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. <br />
In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, <br />
With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown&#8217;d, <br />
With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. <br />
Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour, <br />
And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore. <br />
&#8220;Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, <br />
But southern gales invite us to the main, <br />
We launch our vessels, with a prosp&#8217;rous wind, <br />
And leave the cities and the shores behind. <br />
&#8220;An island in th&#8217; AEgaean main appears; <br />
Neptune and wat&#8217;ry Doris claim it theirs. <br />
It floated once, till Phoebus fix&#8217;d the sides <br />
To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides. <br />
Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, <br />
With needful ease our weary limbs restore, <br />
And the Sun&#8217;s temple and his town adore. <br />
&#8220;Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown&#8217;d, <br />
His hoary locks with purple fillets bound, <br />
Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend, <br />
Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend; <br />
Invites him to his palace; and, in sign <br />
Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join. <br />
Then to the temple of the god I went, <br />
And thus, before the shrine, my vows present: <br />
&#8216;Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place <br />
To the sad relics of the Trojan race; <br />
A seat secure, a region of their own, <br />
A lasting empire, and a happier town. <br />
Where shall we fix? where shall our labors end? <br />
Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend? <br />
Let not my pray&#8217;rs a doubtful answer find; <br />
But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.&#8217; <br />
Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, <br />
The laurels, and the lofty hills around; <br />
And from the tripos rush&#8217;d a bellowing sound. <br />
Prostrate we fell; confess&#8217;d the present god, <br />
Who gave this answer from his dark abode: <br />
&#8216;Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth <br />
From which your ancestors derive their birth. <br />
The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race <br />
In her old bosom shall again embrace. <br />
Thro&#8217; the wide world th&#8217; AEneian house shall reign, <br />
And children&#8217;s children shall the crown sustain.&#8217; <br />
Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose: <br />
A mighty tumult, mix&#8217;d with joy, arose. <br />
&#8220;All are concern&#8217;d to know what place the god <br />
Assign&#8217;d, and where determin&#8217;d our abode. <br />
My father, long revolving in his mind <br />
The race and lineage of the Trojan kind, <br />
Thus answer&#8217;d their demands: &#8216;Ye princes, hear <br />
Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear. <br />
The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame, <br />
Sacred of old to Jove&#8217;s imperial name, <br />
In the mid ocean lies, with large command, <br />
And on its plains a hundred cities stand. <br />
Another Ida rises there, and we <br />
From thence derive our Trojan ancestry. <br />
From thence, as &#8216;t is divulg&#8217;d by certain fame, <br />
To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came; <br />
There fix&#8217;d, and there the seat of empire chose, <br />
Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow&#8217;rs arose. <br />
In humble vales they built their soft abodes, <br />
Till Cybele, the mother of the gods, <br />
With tinkling cymbals charm&#8217;d th&#8217; Idaean woods, <br />
She secret rites and ceremonies taught, <br />
And to the yoke the savage lions brought. <br />
Let us the land which Heav&#8217;n appoints, explore; <br />
Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore. <br />
If Jove assists the passage of our fleet, <br />
The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.&#8217; <br />
Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid <br />
On smoking altars, to the gods he paid: <br />
A bull, to Neptune an oblation due, <br />
Another bull to bright Apollo slew; <br />
A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, <br />
And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. <br />
Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread <br />
That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled, <br />
Expell&#8217;d and exil&#8217;d; that the coast was free <br />
From foreign or domestic enemy. <br />
&#8220;We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea; <br />
By Naxos, fam&#8217;d for vintage, make our way; <br />
Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight <br />
Of Paros&#8217; isle, with marble quarries white. <br />
We pass the scatter&#8217;d isles of Cyclades, <br />
That, scarce distinguish&#8217;d, seem to stud the seas. <br />
The shouts of sailors double near the shores; <br />
They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars. <br />
&#8216;All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!&#8217; they cry, <br />
And swiftly thro&#8217; the foamy billows fly. <br />
Full on the promis&#8217;d land at length we bore, <br />
With joy descending on the Cretan shore. <br />
With eager haste a rising town I frame, <br />
Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name: <br />
The name itself was grateful; I exhort <br />
To found their houses, and erect a fort. <br />
Our ships are haul&#8217;d upon the yellow strand; <br />
The youth begin to till the labor&#8217;d land; <br />
And I myself new marriages promote, <br />
Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot; <br />
When rising vapors choke the wholesome air, <br />
And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year; <br />
The trees devouring caterpillars burn; <br />
Parch&#8217;d was the grass, and blighted was the corn: <br />
Nor &#8216;scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high, <br />
With pestilential heat infects the sky: <br />
My men&#8211;some fall, the rest in fevers fry. <br />
Again my father bids me seek the shore <br />
Of sacred Delos, and the god implore, <br />
To learn what end of woes we might expect, <br />
And to what clime our weary course direct. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;T was night, when ev&#8217;ry creature, void of cares, <br />
The common gift of balmy slumber shares: <br />
The statues of my gods (for such they seem&#8217;d), <br />
Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem&#8217;d, <br />
Before me stood, majestically bright, <br />
Full in the beams of Phoebe&#8217;s ent&#8217;ring light. <br />
Then thus they spoke, and eas&#8217;d my troubled mind: <br />
&#8216;What from the Delian god thou go&#8217;st to find, <br />
He tells thee here, and sends us to relate. <br />
Those pow&#8217;rs are we, companions of thy fate, <br />
Who from the burning town by thee were brought, <br />
Thy fortune follow&#8217;d, and thy safety wrought. <br />
Thro&#8217; seas and lands as we thy steps attend, <br />
So shall our care thy glorious race befriend. <br />
An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain, <br />
A town that o&#8217;er the conquer&#8217;d world shall reign. <br />
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; <br />
Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield: <br />
But change thy seat; for not the Delian god, <br />
Nor we, have giv&#8217;n thee Crete for our abode. <br />
A land there is, Hesperia call&#8217;d of old, <br />
(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold&#8211; <br />
Th&#8217; OEnotrians held it once,) by later fame <br />
Now call&#8217;d Italia, from the leader&#8217;s name. <br />
Iasius there and Dardanus were born; <br />
From thence we came, and thither must return. <br />
Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. <br />
Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;Astonish&#8217;d at their voices and their sight, <br />
(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; <br />
I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, <br />
In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;) <br />
I started from my couch; a clammy sweat <br />
On all my limbs and shiv&#8217;ring body sate. <br />
To heav&#8217;n I lift my hands with pious haste, <br />
And sacred incense in the flames I cast. <br />
Thus to the gods their perfect honors done, <br />
More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, <br />
And tell the pleasing news. In little space <br />
He found his error of the double race; <br />
Not, as before he deem&#8217;d, deriv&#8217;d from Crete; <br />
No more deluded by the doubtful seat: <br />
Then said: &#8216;O son, turmoil&#8217;d in Trojan fate! <br />
Such things as these Cassandra did relate. <br />
This day revives within my mind what she <br />
Foretold of Troy renew&#8217;d in Italy, <br />
And Latian lands; but who could then have thought <br />
That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, <br />
Or who believ&#8217;d what mad Cassandra taught? <br />
Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;He said; and we with glad consent obey, <br />
Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, <br />
We spread our sails before the willing wind. <br />
Now from the sight of land our galleys move, <br />
With only seas around and skies above; <br />
When o&#8217;er our heads descends a burst of rain, <br />
And night with sable clouds involves the main; <br />
The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; <br />
The scatter&#8217;d fleet is forc&#8217;d to sev&#8217;ral ways; <br />
The face of heav&#8217;n is ravish&#8217;d from our eyes, <br />
And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. <br />
Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. <br />
No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Palinurus no distinction found <br />
Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign&#8217;d around <br />
Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, <br />
Without distinction, and three sunless days; <br />
The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, <br />
We view a rising land, like distant clouds; <br />
The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, <br />
And curling smoke ascending from their height. <br />
The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; <br />
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. <br />
At length I land upon the Strophades, <br />
Safe from the danger of the stormy seas. <br />
Those isles are compass&#8217;d by th&#8217; Ionian main, <br />
The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign, <br />
Forc&#8217;d by the winged warriors to repair <br />
To their old homes, and leave their costly fare. <br />
Monsters more fierce offended Heav&#8217;n ne&#8217;er sent <br />
From hell&#8217;s abyss, for human punishment: <br />
With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene, <br />
Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; <br />
With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. <br />
&#8220;We landed at the port, and soon beheld <br />
Fat herds of oxen graze the flow&#8217;ry field, <br />
And wanton goats without a keeper stray&#8217;d. <br />
With weapons we the welcome prey invade, <br />
Then call the gods for partners of our feast, <br />
And Jove himself, the chief invited guest. <br />
We spread the tables on the greensward ground; <br />
We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; <br />
When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, <br />
And clatt&#8217;ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly; <br />
They snatch the meat, defiling all they find, <br />
And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. <br />
Close by a hollow rock, again we sit, <br />
New dress the dinner, and the beds refit, <br />
Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, <br />
Where tufted trees a native arbor made. <br />
Again the holy fires on altars burn; <br />
And once again the rav&#8217;nous birds return, <br />
Or from the dark recesses where they lie, <br />
Or from another quarter of the sky; <br />
With filthy claws their odious meal repeat, <br />
And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. <br />
I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare, <br />
And with the hellish nation wage the war. <br />
They, as commanded, for the fight provide, <br />
And in the grass their glitt&#8217;ring weapons hide; <br />
Then, when along the crooked shore we hear <br />
Their clatt&#8217;ring wings, and saw the foes appear, <br />
Misenus sounds a charge: we take th&#8217; alarm, <br />
And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm. <br />
In this new kind of combat all employ <br />
Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy. <br />
In vain&#8211;the fated skin is proof to wounds; <br />
And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds. <br />
At length rebuff&#8217;d, they leave their mangled prey, <br />
And their stretch&#8217;d pinions to the skies display. <br />
Yet one remain&#8217;d&#8211;the messenger of Fate: <br />
High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate, <br />
And thus her dismal errand did relate: <br />
&#8216;What! not contented with our oxen slain, <br />
Dare you with Heav&#8217;n an impious war maintain, <br />
And drive the Harpies from their native reign? <br />
Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind <br />
What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design&#8217;d, <br />
And I, the Furies&#8217; queen, from both relate&#8211; <br />
You seek th&#8217; Italian shores, foredoom&#8217;d by fate: <br />
Th&#8217; Italian shores are granted you to find, <br />
And a safe passage to the port assign&#8217;d. <br />
But know, that ere your promis&#8217;d walls you build, <br />
My curses shall severely be fulfill&#8217;d. <br />
Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed, <br />
Reduc&#8217;d to grind the plates on which you feed.&#8217; <br />
She said, and to the neighb&#8217;ring forest flew. <br />
Our courage fails us, and our fears renew. <br />
Hopeless to win by war, to pray&#8217;rs we fall, <br />
And on th&#8217; offended Harpies humbly call, <br />
And whether gods or birds obscene they were, <br />
Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer. <br />
But old Anchises, off&#8217;ring sacrifice, <br />
And lifting up to heav&#8217;n his hands and eyes, <br />
Ador&#8217;d the greater gods: &#8216;Avert,&#8217; said he, <br />
&#8216;These omens; render vain this prophecy, <br />
And from th&#8217; impending curse a pious people free!&#8217; <br />
&#8220;Thus having said, he bids us put to sea; <br />
We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, <br />
And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat&#8217;ry way. <br />
Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; <br />
And next by rocky Neritos we steer: <br />
We fly from Ithaca&#8217;s detested shore, <br />
And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. <br />
At length Leucate&#8217;s cloudy top appears, <br />
And the Sun&#8217;s temple, which the sailor fears. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to breathe a while from labor past, <br />
Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, <br />
And joyful to the little city haste. <br />
Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay <br />
To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. <br />
The customs of our country we pursue, <br />
And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. <br />
Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, <br />
And exercise the wrastlers&#8217; noble toil; <br />
Pleas&#8217;d to have sail&#8217;d so long before the wind, <br />
And left so many Grecian towns behind. <br />
The sun had now fulfill&#8217;d his annual course, <br />
And Boreas on the seas display&#8217;d his force: <br />
I fix&#8217;d upon the temple&#8217;s lofty door <br />
The brazen shield which vanquish&#8217;d Abas bore; <br />
The verse beneath my name and action speaks: <br />
&#8216;These arms AEneas took from conqu&#8217;ring Greeks.&#8217; <br />
Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply <br />
Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. <br />
The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost, <br />
And skimm&#8217;d along Epirus&#8217; rocky coast. <br />
&#8220;Then to Chaonia&#8217;s port our course we bend, <br />
And, landed, to Buthrotus&#8217; heights ascend. <br />
Here wondrous things were loudly blaz&#8217;d by fame: <br />
How Helenus reviv&#8217;d the Trojan name, <br />
And reign&#8217;d in Greece; that Priam&#8217;s captive son <br />
Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne; <br />
And fair Andromache, restor&#8217;d by fate, <br />
Once more was happy in a Trojan mate. <br />
I leave my galleys riding in the port, <br />
And long to see the new Dardanian court. <br />
By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate, <br />
Then solemniz&#8217;d her former husband&#8217;s fate. <br />
Green altars, rais&#8217;d of turf, with gifts she crown&#8217;d, <br />
And sacred priests in order stand around, <br />
And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. <br />
The grove itself resembles Ida&#8217;s wood; <br />
And Simois seem&#8217;d the well-dissembled flood. <br />
But when at nearer distance she beheld <br />
My shining armor and my Trojan shield, <br />
Astonish&#8217;d at the sight, the vital heat <br />
Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat: <br />
She faints, she falls, and scarce recov&#8217;ring strength, <br />
Thus, with a falt&#8217;ring tongue, she speaks at length: <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Are you alive, O goddess-born?&#8217; she said, <br />
&#8216;Or if a ghost, then where is Hector&#8217;s shade?&#8217; <br />
At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry. <br />
With broken words I made this brief reply: <br />
&#8216;All of me that remains appears in sight; <br />
I live, if living be to loathe the light. <br />
No phantom; but I drag a wretched life, <br />
My fate resembling that of Hector&#8217;s wife. <br />
What have you suffer&#8217;d since you lost your lord? <br />
By what strange blessing are you now restor&#8217;d? <br />
Still are your Hector&#8217;s? or is Hector fled, <br />
And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus&#8217; bed?&#8217; <br />
With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone, <br />
After a modest pause she thus begun: <br />
&#8220;&#8216;O only happy maid of Priam&#8217;s race, <br />
Whom death deliver&#8217;d from the foes&#8217; embrace! <br />
Commanded on Achilles&#8217; tomb to die, <br />
Not forc&#8217;d, like us, to hard captivity, <br />
Or in a haughty master&#8217;s arms to lie. <br />
In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne, <br />
Endur&#8217;d the victor&#8217;s lust, sustain&#8217;d the scorn: <br />
Thus I submitted to the lawless pride <br />
Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride. <br />
Cloy&#8217;d with possession, he forsook my bed, <br />
And Helen&#8217;s lovely daughter sought to wed; <br />
Then me to Trojan Helenus resign&#8217;d, <br />
And his two slaves in equal marriage join&#8217;d; <br />
Till young Orestes, pierc&#8217;d with deep despair, <br />
And longing to redeem the promis&#8217;d fair, <br />
Before Apollo&#8217;s altar slew the ravisher. <br />
By Pyrrhus&#8217; death the kingdom we regain&#8217;d: <br />
At least one half with Helenus remain&#8217;d. <br />
Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls, <br />
And names from Pergamus his rising walls. <br />
But you, what fates have landed on our coast? <br />
What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss&#8217;d? <br />
Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy, <br />
Sav&#8217;d from the ruins of unhappy Troy? <br />
O tell me how his mother&#8217;s loss he bears, <br />
What hopes are promis&#8217;d from his blooming years, <br />
How much of Hector in his face appears?&#8217; <br />
She spoke; and mix&#8217;d her speech with mournful cries, <br />
And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes. <br />
&#8220;At length her lord descends upon the plain, <br />
In pomp, attended with a num&#8217;rous train; <br />
Receives his friends, and to the city leads, <br />
And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds. <br />
Proceeding on, another Troy I see, <br />
Or, in less compass, Troy&#8217;s epitome. <br />
A riv&#8217;let by the name of Xanthus ran, <br />
And I embrace the Scaean gate again. <br />
My friends in porticoes were entertain&#8217;d, <br />
And feasts and pleasures thro&#8217; the city reign&#8217;d. <br />
The tables fill&#8217;d the spacious hall around, <br />
And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown&#8217;d. <br />
Two days we pass&#8217;d in mirth, till friendly gales, <br />
Blown from the south, supplied our swelling sails. <br />
Then to the royal seer I thus began: <br />
&#8216;O thou, who know&#8217;st, beyond the reach of man, <br />
The laws of heav&#8217;n, and what the stars decree; <br />
Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy, <br />
From his own tripod, and his holy tree; <br />
Skill&#8217;d in the wing&#8217;d inhabitants of air, <br />
What auspices their notes and flights declare: <br />
O say&#8211;for all religious rites portend <br />
A happy voyage, and a prosp&#8217;rous end; <br />
And ev&#8217;ry power and omen of the sky <br />
Direct my course for destin&#8217;d Italy; <br />
But only dire Celaeno, from the gods, <br />
A dismal famine fatally forebodes&#8211; <br />
O say what dangers I am first to shun, <br />
What toils to vanquish, and what course to run.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;The prophet first with sacrifice adores <br />
The greater gods; their pardon then implores; <br />
Unbinds the fillet from his holy head; <br />
To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led, <br />
Full of religious doubts and awful dread. <br />
Then, with his god possess&#8217;d, before the shrine, <br />
These words proceeded from his mouth divine: <br />
&#8216;O goddess-born, (for Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s appointed will, <br />
With greater auspices of good than ill, <br />
Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; <br />
Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,) <br />
Of many things some few I shall explain, <br />
Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, <br />
And how at length the promis&#8217;d shore to gain. <br />
The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, <br />
And Juno&#8217;s angry pow&#8217;r forbids to tell. <br />
First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, <br />
Will far from your deluded wishes fly; <br />
Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: <br />
For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, <br />
And stem the currents with your struggling oars; <br />
Then round th&#8217; Italian coast your navy steer; <br />
And, after this, to Circe&#8217;s island veer; <br />
And, last, before your new foundations rise, <br />
Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. <br />
Now mark the signs of future ease and rest, <br />
And bear them safely treasur&#8217;d in thy breast. <br />
When, in the shady shelter of a wood, <br />
And near the margin of a gentle flood, <br />
Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, <br />
With thirty sucking young encompass&#8217;d round; <br />
The dam and offspring white as falling snow&#8211; <br />
These on thy city shall their name bestow, <br />
And there shall end thy labors and thy woe. <br />
Nor let the threaten&#8217;d famine fright thy mind, <br />
For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find. <br />
Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, <br />
Which fronts from far th&#8217; Epirian continent: <br />
Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess&#8217;d; <br />
The salvage Locrians here the shores infest; <br />
There fierce Idomeneus his city builds, <br />
And guards with arms the Salentinian fields; <br />
And on the mountain&#8217;s brow Petilia stands, <br />
Which Philoctetes with his troops commands. <br />
Ev&#8217;n when thy fleet is landed on the shore, <br />
And priests with holy vows the gods adore, <br />
Then with a purple veil involve your eyes, <br />
Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice. <br />
These rites and customs to the rest commend, <br />
That to your pious race they may descend. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits <br />
For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits <br />
Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way, <br />
Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: <br />
Veer starboard sea and land. Th&#8217; Italian shore <br />
And fair Sicilia&#8217;s coast were one, before <br />
An earthquake caus&#8217;d the flaw: the roaring tides <br />
The passage broke that land from land divides; <br />
And where the lands retir&#8217;d, the rushing ocean rides. <br />
Distinguish&#8217;d by the straits, on either hand, <br />
Now rising cities in long order stand, <br />
And fruitful fields: so much can time invade <br />
The mold&#8217;ring work that beauteous Nature made. <br />
Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides: <br />
Charybdis roaring on the left presides, <br />
And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides; <br />
Then spouts them from below: with fury driv&#8217;n, <br />
The waves mount up and wash the face of heav&#8217;n. <br />
But Scylla from her den, with open jaws, <br />
The sinking vessel in her eddy draws, <br />
Then dashes on the rocks. A human face, <br />
And virgin bosom, hides her tail&#8217;s disgrace: <br />
Her parts obscene below the waves descend, <br />
With dogs inclos&#8217;d, and in a dolphin end. <br />
&#8216;T is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea, <br />
And coast Pachynus, tho&#8217; with more delay, <br />
Than once to view misshapen Scylla near, <br />
And the loud yell of wat&#8217;ry wolves to hear. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Besides, if faith to Helenus be due, <br />
And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true, <br />
Do not this precept of your friend forget, <br />
Which therefore more than once I must repeat: <br />
Above the rest, great Juno&#8217;s name adore; <br />
Pay vows to Juno; Juno&#8217;s aid implore. <br />
Let gifts be to the mighty queen design&#8217;d, <br />
And mollify with pray&#8217;rs her haughty mind. <br />
Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free, <br />
And you shall safe descend on Italy. <br />
Arriv&#8217;d at Cumae, when you view the flood <br />
Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood, <br />
The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, <br />
Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin&#8217;d. <br />
She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, <br />
The notes and names, inscrib&#8217;d, to leafs commits. <br />
What she commits to leafs, in order laid, <br />
Before the cavern&#8217;s entrance are display&#8217;d: <br />
Unmov&#8217;d they lie; but, if a blast of wind <br />
Without, or vapors issue from behind, <br />
The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air, <br />
And she resumes no more her museful care, <br />
Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter&#8217;d verse, <br />
Nor sets in order what the winds disperse. <br />
Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid <br />
The madness of the visionary maid, <br />
And with loud curses leave the mystic shade. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Think it not loss of time a while to stay, <br />
Tho&#8217; thy companions chide thy long delay; <br />
Tho&#8217; summon&#8217;d to the seas, tho&#8217; pleasing gales <br />
Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: <br />
But beg the sacred priestess to relate <br />
With willing words, and not to write thy fate. <br />
The fierce Italian people she will show, <br />
And all thy wars, and all thy future woe, <br />
And what thou may&#8217;st avoid, and what must undergo. <br />
She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind, <br />
And teach thee how the happy shores to find. <br />
This is what Heav&#8217;n allows me to relate: <br />
Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate, <br />
And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;This when the priest with friendly voice declar&#8217;d, <br />
He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar&#8217;d: <br />
Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want <br />
With heavy gold, and polish&#8217;d elephant; <br />
Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry ship with sums of silver stor&#8217;d. <br />
A trusty coat of mail to me he sent, <br />
Thrice chain&#8217;d with gold, for use and ornament; <br />
The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest, <br />
That flourish&#8217;d with a plume and waving crest. <br />
Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends; <br />
And large recruits he to my navy sends: <br />
Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; <br />
Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. <br />
Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, <br />
Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales. <br />
&#8220;The prophet bless&#8217;d the parting crew, and last, <br />
With words like these, his ancient friend embrac&#8217;d: <br />
&#8216;Old happy man, the care of gods above, <br />
Whom heav&#8217;nly Venus honor&#8217;d with her love, <br />
And twice preserv&#8217;d thy life, when Troy was lost, <br />
Behold from far the wish&#8217;d Ausonian coast: <br />
There land; but take a larger compass round, <br />
For that before is all forbidden ground. <br />
The shore that Phoebus has design&#8217;d for you, <br />
At farther distance lies, conceal&#8217;d from view. <br />
Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes, <br />
Blest in a son, and favor&#8217;d by the gods: <br />
For I with useless words prolong your stay, <br />
When southern gales have summon&#8217;d you away.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor&#8217;d, <br />
Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord. <br />
A noble present to my son she brought, <br />
A robe with flow&#8217;rs on golden tissue wrought, <br />
A Phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside <br />
Of precious texture, and of Asian pride. <br />
&#8216;Accept,&#8217; she said, &#8216;these monuments of love, <br />
Which in my youth with happier hands I wove: <br />
Regard these trifles for the giver&#8217;s sake; <br />
&#8216;T is the last present Hector&#8217;s wife can make. <br />
Thou call&#8217;st my lost Astyanax to mind; <br />
In thee his features and his form I find: <br />
His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; <br />
Such were his motions; such was all his frame; <br />
And ah! had Heav&#8217;n so pleas&#8217;d, his years had been the same.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;With tears I took my last adieu, and said: <br />
&#8216;Your fortune, happy pair, already made, <br />
Leaves you no farther wish. My diff&#8217;rent state, <br />
Avoiding one, incurs another fate. <br />
To you a quiet seat the gods allow: <br />
You have no shores to search, no seas to plow, <br />
Nor fields of flying Italy to chase: <br />
(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!) <br />
You see another Simois, and enjoy <br />
The labor of your hands, another Troy, <br />
With better auspice than her ancient tow&#8217;rs, <br />
And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow&#8217;rs. <br />
If e&#8217;er the gods, whom I with vows adore, <br />
Conduct my steps to Tiber&#8217;s happy shore; <br />
If ever I ascend the Latian throne, <br />
And build a city I may call my own; <br />
As both of us our birth from Troy derive, <br />
So let our kindred lines in concord live, <br />
And both in acts of equal friendship strive. <br />
Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same: <br />
The double Troy shall differ but in name; <br />
That what we now begin may never end, <br />
But long to late posterity descend.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore; <br />
The shortest passage to th&#8217; Italian shore. <br />
Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light, <br />
And hills were hid in dusky shades of night: <br />
We land, and, on the bosom of the ground, <br />
A safe retreat and a bare lodging found. <br />
Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep <br />
Their watches, and the rest securely sleep. <br />
The night, proceeding on with silent pace, <br />
Stood in her noon, and view&#8217;d with equal face <br />
Her steepy rise and her declining race. <br />
Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy <br />
The face of heav&#8217;n, and the nocturnal sky; <br />
And listen&#8217;d ev&#8217;ry breath of air to try; <br />
Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course, <br />
The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat&#8217;ry force; <br />
And both the Bears is careful to behold, <br />
And bright Orion, arm&#8217;d with burnish&#8217;d gold. <br />
Then, when he saw no threat&#8217;ning tempest nigh, <br />
But a sure promise of a settled sky, <br />
He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep, <br />
Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. <br />
&#8220;And now the rising morn with rosy light <br />
Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; <br />
When we from far, like bluish mists, descry <br />
The hills, and then the plains, of Italy. <br />
Achates first pronounc&#8217;d the joyful sound; <br />
Then, &#8216;Italy!&#8217; the cheerful crew rebound. <br />
My sire Anchises crown&#8217;d a cup with wine, <br />
And, off&#8217;ring, thus implor&#8217;d the pow&#8217;rs divine: <br />
&#8216;Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, <br />
And you who raging winds and waves appease, <br />
Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp&#8217;rous wind, <br />
And smooth our passage to the port assign&#8217;d!&#8217; <br />
The gentle gales their flagging force renew, <br />
And now the happy harbor is in view. <br />
Minerva&#8217;s temple then salutes our sight, <br />
Plac&#8217;d, as a landmark, on the mountain&#8217;s height. <br />
We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; <br />
The curling waters round the galleys roar. <br />
The land lies open to the raging east, <br />
Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress&#8217;d, <br />
Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain, <br />
And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. <br />
The port lies hid within; on either side <br />
Two tow&#8217;ring rocks the narrow mouth divide. <br />
The temple, which aloft we view&#8217;d before, <br />
To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. <br />
Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld <br />
Were four white steeds that cropp&#8217;d the flow&#8217;ry field. <br />
&#8216;War, war is threaten&#8217;d from this foreign ground,&#8217; <br />
My father cried, &#8216;where warlike steeds are found. <br />
Yet, since reclaim&#8217;d to chariots they submit, <br />
And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, <br />
Peace may succeed to war.&#8217; Our way we bend <br />
To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend; <br />
There prostrate to the fierce virago pray, <br />
Whose temple was the landmark of our way. <br />
Each with a Phrygian mantle veil&#8217;d his head, <br />
And all commands of Helenus obey&#8217;d, <br />
And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. <br />
These dues perform&#8217;d, we stretch our sails, and stand <br />
To sea, forsaking that suspected land. <br />
&#8220;From hence Tarentum&#8217;s bay appears in view, <br />
For Hercules renown&#8217;d, if fame be true. <br />
Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands; <br />
Caulonian tow&#8217;rs, and Scylacaean strands, <br />
For shipwrecks fear&#8217;d. Mount AEtna thence we spy, <br />
Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky. <br />
Far off we hear the waves with surly sound <br />
Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. <br />
The billows break upon the sounding strand, <br />
And roll the rising tide, impure with sand. <br />
Then thus Anchises, in experience old: <br />
&#8221;T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold, <br />
And those the promis&#8217;d rocks! Bear off to sea!&#8217; <br />
With haste the frighted mariners obey. <br />
First Palinurus to the larboard veer&#8217;d; <br />
Then all the fleet by his example steer&#8217;d. <br />
To heav&#8217;n aloft on ridgy waves we ride, <br />
Then down to hell descend, when they divide; <br />
And thrice our galleys knock&#8217;d the stony ground, <br />
And thrice the hollow rocks return&#8217;d the sound, <br />
And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around. <br />
The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun; <br />
And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run. <br />
The port capacious, and secure from wind, <br />
Is to the foot of thund&#8217;ring AEtna join&#8217;d. <br />
By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; <br />
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly, <br />
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. <br />
Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown, <br />
And, shiver&#8217;d by the force, come piecemeal down. <br />
Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, <br />
Fed from the fiery springs that boil below. <br />
Enceladus, they say, transfix&#8217;d by Jove, <br />
With blasted limbs came tumbling from above; <br />
And, where he fell, th&#8217; avenging father drew <br />
This flaming hill, and on his body threw. <br />
As often as he turns his weary sides, <br />
He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides. <br />
In shady woods we pass the tedious night, <br />
Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, <br />
Of which no cause is offer&#8217;d to the sight; <br />
For not one star was kindled in the sky, <br />
Nor could the moon her borrow&#8217;d light supply; <br />
For misty clouds involv&#8217;d the firmament, <br />
The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. <br />
&#8220;Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal&#8217;d, <br />
Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell&#8217;d, <br />
When from the woods there bolts, before our sight, <br />
Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite, <br />
So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan, <br />
So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man. <br />
This thing, all tatter&#8217;d, seem&#8217;d from far t&#8217; implore <br />
Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore. <br />
We look behind, then view his shaggy beard; <br />
His clothes were tagg&#8217;d with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear&#8217;d; <br />
The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, <br />
Appear&#8217;d a Greek, and such indeed he was. <br />
He cast on us, from far, a frightful view, <br />
Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew; <br />
Stood still, and paus&#8217;d; then all at once began <br />
To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran. <br />
Soon as approach&#8217;d, upon his knees he falls, <br />
And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: <br />
&#8216;Now, by the pow&#8217;rs above, and what we share <br />
From Nature&#8217;s common gift, this vital air, <br />
O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; <br />
But bear me far from this unhappy shore. <br />
&#8216;T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own, <br />
Among your foes besieg&#8217;d th&#8217; imperial town. <br />
For such demerits if my death be due, <br />
No more for this abandon&#8217;d life I sue; <br />
This only favor let my tears obtain, <br />
To throw me headlong in the rapid main: <br />
Since nothing more than death my crime demands, <br />
I die content, to die by human hands.&#8217; <br />
He said, and on his knees my knees embrac&#8217;d: <br />
I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, <br />
His present state, his lineage, and his name, <br />
Th&#8217; occasion of his fears, and whence he came. <br />
The good Anchises rais&#8217;d him with his hand; <br />
Who, thus encourag&#8217;d, answer&#8217;d our demand: <br />
&#8216;From Ithaca, my native soil, I came <br />
To Troy; and Achaemenides my name. <br />
Me my poor father with Ulysses sent; <br />
(O had I stay&#8217;d, with poverty content!) <br />
But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen <br />
Left me forsaken in the Cyclops&#8217; den. <br />
The cave, tho&#8217; large, was dark; the dismal floor <br />
Was pav&#8217;d with mangled limbs and putrid gore. <br />
Our monstrous host, of more than human size, <br />
Erects his head, and stares within the skies; <br />
Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. <br />
Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! <br />
The joints of slaughter&#8217;d wretches are his food; <br />
And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood. <br />
These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand <br />
He seiz&#8217;d two captives of our Grecian band; <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on his back, he dash&#8217;d against the stones <br />
Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones: <br />
With spouting blood the purple pavement swims, <br />
While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Not unreveng&#8217;d Ulysses bore their fate, <br />
Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state; <br />
For, gorg&#8217;d with flesh, and drunk with human wine <br />
While fast asleep the giant lay supine, <br />
Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw <br />
His indigested foam, and morsels raw; <br />
We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround <br />
The monstrous body, stretch&#8217;d along the ground: <br />
Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand <br />
To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand. <br />
Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye; <br />
For only one did the vast frame supply&#8211; <br />
But that a globe so large, his front it fill&#8217;d, <br />
Like the sun&#8217;s disk or like a Grecian shield. <br />
The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends: <br />
This vengeance follow&#8217;d for our slaughter&#8217;d friends. <br />
But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly! <br />
Your cables cut, and on your oars rely! <br />
Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears, <br />
A hundred more this hated island bears: <br />
Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; <br />
Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; <br />
Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep. <br />
And now three moons their sharpen&#8217;d horns renew, <br />
Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view, <br />
I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, <br />
And in deserted caverns lodge by night; <br />
Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see <br />
Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree: <br />
From far I hear his thund&#8217;ring voice resound, <br />
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground. <br />
Cornels and salvage berries of the wood, <br />
And roots and herbs, have been my meager food. <br />
While all around my longing eyes I cast, <br />
I saw your happy ships appear at last. <br />
On those I fix&#8217;d my hopes, to these I run; <br />
&#8216;T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun; <br />
What other death you please, yourselves bestow.&#8217; <br />
&#8220;Scarce had he said, when on the mountain&#8217;s brow <br />
We saw the giant shepherd stalk before <br />
His following flock, and leading to the shore: <br />
A monstrous bulk, deform&#8217;d, depriv&#8217;d of sight; <br />
His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. <br />
His pond&#8217;rous whistle from his neck descends; <br />
His woolly care their pensive lord attends: <br />
This only solace his hard fortune sends. <br />
Soon as he reach&#8217;d the shore and touch&#8217;d the waves, <br />
From his bor&#8217;d eye the gutt&#8217;ring blood he laves: <br />
He gnash&#8217;d his teeth, and groan&#8217;d; thro&#8217; seas he strides, <br />
And scarce the topmost billows touch&#8217;d his sides. <br />
&#8220;Seiz&#8217;d with a sudden fear, we run to sea, <br />
The cables cut, and silent haste away; <br />
The well-deserving stranger entertain; <br />
Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main. <br />
The giant harken&#8217;d to the dashing sound: <br />
But, when our vessels out of reach he found, <br />
He strided onward, and in vain essay&#8217;d <br />
Th&#8217; Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade. <br />
With that he roar&#8217;d aloud: the dreadful cry <br />
Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly <br />
Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy. <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring AEtna trembling all around, <br />
The winding caverns echo to the sound. <br />
His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar, <br />
And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore. <br />
We saw their stern distorted looks, from far, <br />
And one-eye&#8217;d glance, that vainly threaten&#8217;d war: <br />
A dreadful council, with their heads on high; <br />
(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;) <br />
Not yielding to the tow&#8217;ring tree of Jove, <br />
Or tallest cypress of Diana&#8217;s grove. <br />
New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail; <br />
We tug at ev&#8217;ry oar, and hoist up ev&#8217;ry sail, <br />
And take th&#8217; advantage of the friendly gale. <br />
Forewarn&#8217;d by Helenus, we strive to shun <br />
Charybdis&#8217; gulf, nor dare to Scylla run. <br />
An equal fate on either side appears: <br />
We, tacking to the left, are free from fears; <br />
For, from Pelorus&#8217; point, the North arose, <br />
And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows. <br />
His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way <br />
By Thapsus and Megara&#8217;s winding bay. <br />
This passage Achaemenides had shown, <br />
Tracing the course which he before had run. <br />
&#8220;Right o&#8217;er against Plemmyrium&#8217;s wat&#8217;ry strand, <br />
There lies an isle once call&#8217;d th&#8217; Ortygian land. <br />
Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found <br />
From Greece a secret passage under ground, <br />
By love to beauteous Arethusa led; <br />
And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. <br />
As Helenus enjoin&#8217;d, we next adore <br />
Diana&#8217;s name, protectress of the shore. <br />
With prosp&#8217;rous gales we pass the quiet sounds <br />
Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds. <br />
Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey <br />
The rocky shore extended to the sea. <br />
The town of Camarine from far we see, <br />
And fenny lake, undrain&#8217;d by fate&#8217;s decree. <br />
In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, <br />
And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; <br />
Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown&#8217;d, <br />
Long for the race of warlike steeds renown&#8217;d. <br />
We pass&#8217;d Selinus, and the palmy land, <br />
And widely shun the Lilybaean strand, <br />
Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. <br />
At length on shore the weary fleet arriv&#8217;d, <br />
Which Drepanum&#8217;s unhappy port receiv&#8217;d. <br />
Here, after endless labors, often toss&#8217;d <br />
By raging storms, and driv&#8217;n on ev&#8217;ry coast, <br />
My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: <br />
Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain, <br />
Sav&#8217;d thro&#8217; a thousand toils, but sav&#8217;d in vain. <br />
The prophet, who my future woes reveal&#8217;d, <br />
Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal&#8217;d; <br />
And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill <br />
Denounc&#8217;d all else, was silent of this ill. <br />
This my last labor was. Some friendly god <br />
From thence convey&#8217;d us to your blest abode.&#8221; <br />
Thus, to the list&#8217;ning queen, the royal guest <br />
His wand&#8217;ring course and all his toils express&#8217;d; <br />
And here concluding, he retir&#8217;d to rest.</p>
