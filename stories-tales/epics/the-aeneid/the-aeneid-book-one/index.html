				<p>THE FIRST BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; The Trojans, after a seven years&#8217; voyage, set<br />
sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which AEolus<br />
raises at Juno&#8217;s request. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the<br />
rest. Neptune drives off the Winds, and calms the sea. AEneas,<br />
with his own ship, and six more, arrives safe at an African port.<br />
Venus complains to Jupiter of her son&#8217;s misfortunes. Jupiter com-<br />
forts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among<br />
the Carthaginians. AEneas, going out to discover the country, meets<br />
his mother in the shape of an huntress, who conveys him in a cloud<br />
to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and<br />
receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by a device<br />
of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some dis-<br />
course with him, desires the history of his adventures since the<br />
siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books.</p>
<p>ARMS, and the man I sing, who, forc&#8217;d by fate, <br />
And haughty Juno&#8217;s unrelenting hate, <br />
Expell&#8217;d and exil&#8217;d, left the Trojan shore. <br />
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore, <br />
And in the doubtful war, before he won <br />
The Latian realm, and built the destin&#8217;d town; <br />
His banish&#8217;d gods restor&#8217;d to rites divine, <br />
And settled sure succession in his line, <br />
From whence the race of Alban fathers come, <br />
And the long glories of majestic Rome. <br />
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; <br />
What goddess was provok&#8217;d, and whence her hate; <br />
For what offense the Queen of Heav&#8217;n began <br />
To persecute so brave, so just a man; <br />
Involv&#8217;d his anxious life in endless cares, <br />
Expos&#8217;d to wants, and hurried into wars! <br />
Can heav&#8217;nly minds such high resentment show, <br />
Or exercise their spite in human woe? <br />
Against the Tiber&#8217;s mouth, but far away, <br />
An ancient town was seated on the sea; <br />
A Tyrian colony; the people made <br />
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade: <br />
Carthage the name; belov&#8217;d by Juno more <br />
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore. <br />
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav&#8217;n were kind, <br />
The seat of awful empire she design&#8217;d. <br />
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly, <br />
(Long cited by the people of the sky,) <br />
That times to come should see the Trojan race <br />
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow&#8217;rs deface; <br />
Nor thus confin&#8217;d, the yoke of sov&#8217;reign sway <br />
Should on the necks of all the nations lay. <br />
She ponder&#8217;d this, and fear&#8217;d it was in fate; <br />
Nor could forget the war she wag&#8217;d of late <br />
For conqu&#8217;ring Greece against the Trojan state. <br />
Besides, long causes working in her mind, <br />
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind; <br />
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain&#8217;d <br />
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain&#8217;d; <br />
The grace bestow&#8217;d on ravish&#8217;d Ganymed, <br />
Electra&#8217;s glories, and her injur&#8217;d bed. <br />
Each was a cause alone; and all combin&#8217;d <br />
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind. <br />
For this, far distant from the Latian coast <br />
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host; <br />
And sev&#8217;n long years th&#8217; unhappy wand&#8217;ring train <br />
Were toss&#8217;d by storms, and scatter&#8217;d thro&#8217; the main. <br />
Such time, such toil, requir&#8217;d the Roman name, <br />
Such length of labor for so vast a frame. <br />
Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars, <br />
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores, <br />
Ent&#8217;ring with cheerful shouts the wat&#8217;ry reign, <br />
And plowing frothy furrows in the main; <br />
When, lab&#8217;ring still with endless discontent, <br />
The Queen of Heav&#8217;n did thus her fury vent: <br />
&#8220;Then am I vanquish&#8217;d? must I yield?&#8221; said she, <br />
&#8220;And must the Trojans reign in Italy? <br />
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force; <br />
Nor can my pow&#8217;r divert their happy course. <br />
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen, <br />
The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men? <br />
She, for the fault of one offending foe, <br />
The bolts of Jove himself presum&#8217;d to throw: <br />
With whirlwinds from beneath she toss&#8217;d the ship, <br />
And bare expos&#8217;d the bosom of the deep; <br />
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, <br />
The wretch, yet hissing with her father&#8217;s flame, <br />
She strongly seiz&#8217;d, and with a burning wound <br />
Transfix&#8217;d, and naked, on a rock she bound. <br />
But I, who walk in awful state above, <br />
The majesty of heav&#8217;n, the sister wife of Jove, <br />
For length of years my fruitless force employ <br />
Against the thin remains of ruin&#8217;d Troy! <br />
What nations now to Juno&#8217;s pow&#8217;r will pray, <br />
Or off&#8217;rings on my slighted altars lay?&#8221; <br />
Thus rag&#8217;d the goddess; and, with fury fraught, <br />
The restless regions of the storms she sought, <br />
Where, in a spacious cave of living stone, <br />
The tyrant AEolus, from his airy throne, <br />
With pow&#8217;r imperial curbs the struggling winds, <br />
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds. <br />
This way and that th&#8217; impatient captives tend, <br />
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend. <br />
High in his hall th&#8217; undaunted monarch stands, <br />
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands; <br />
Which did he not, their unresisted sway <br />
Would sweep the world before them in their way; <br />
Earth, air, and seas thro&#8217; empty space would roll, <br />
And heav&#8217;n would fly before the driving soul. <br />
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods <br />
Confin&#8217;d their fury to those dark abodes, <br />
And lock&#8217;d &#8216;em safe within, oppress&#8217;d with mountain loads; <br />
Impos&#8217;d a king, with arbitrary sway, <br />
To loose their fetters, or their force allay. <br />
To whom the suppliant queen her pray&#8217;rs address&#8217;d, <br />
And thus the tenor of her suit express&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;O AEolus! for to thee the King of Heav&#8217;n <br />
The pow&#8217;r of tempests and of winds has giv&#8217;n; <br />
Thy force alone their fury can restrain, <br />
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main&#8211; <br />
A race of wand&#8217;ring slaves, abhorr&#8217;d by me, <br />
With prosp&#8217;rous passage cut the Tuscan sea; <br />
To fruitful Italy their course they steer, <br />
And for their vanquish&#8217;d gods design new temples there <br />
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; <br />
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies. <br />
Twice sev&#8217;n, the charming daughters of the main, <br />
Around my person wait, and bear my train: <br />
Succeed my wish, and second my design; <br />
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, <br />
And make thee father of a happy line.&#8221; <br />
To this the god: &#8220;&#8216;T is yours, O queen, to will <br />
The work which duty binds me to fulfil. <br />
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command, <br />
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand: <br />
Yours is my sov&#8217;reign&#8217;s grace; and, as your guest, <br />
I sit with gods at their celestial feast; <br />
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; <br />
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.&#8221; <br />
He said, and hurl&#8217;d against the mountain side <br />
His quiv&#8217;ring spear, and all the god applied. <br />
The raging winds rush thro&#8217; the hollow wound, <br />
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground; <br />
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, <br />
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. <br />
South, East, and West with mix&#8217;d confusion roar, <br />
And roll the foaming billows to the shore. <br />
The cables crack; the sailors&#8217; fearful cries <br />
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies; <br />
And heav&#8217;n itself is ravish&#8217;d from their eyes. <br />
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; <br />
Then flashing fires the transient light renew; <br />
The face of things a frightful image bears, <br />
And present death in various forms appears. <br />
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief, <br />
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief; <br />
And, &#8220;Thrice and four times happy those,&#8221; he cried, <br />
&#8220;That under Ilian walls before their parents died! <br />
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train! <br />
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain, <br />
And lie by noble Hector on the plain, <br />
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields <br />
Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields <br />
Of heroes, whose dismember&#8217;d hands yet bear <br />
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!&#8221; <br />
Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails, <br />
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails, <br />
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise, <br />
And mount the tossing vessel to the skies: <br />
Nor can the shiv&#8217;ring oars sustain the blow; <br />
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow; <br />
While those astern, descending down the steep, <br />
Thro&#8217; gaping waves behold the boiling deep. <br />
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast, <br />
And on the secret shelves with fury cast. <br />
Those hidden rocks th&#8217; Ausonian sailors knew: <br />
They call&#8217;d them Altars, when they rose in view, <br />
And show&#8217;d their spacious backs above the flood. <br />
Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood, <br />
Dash&#8217;d on the shallows of the moving sand, <br />
And in mid ocean left them moor&#8217;d aland. <br />
Orontes&#8217; bark, that bore the Lycian crew, <br />
(A horrid sight!) ev&#8217;n in the hero&#8217;s view, <br />
From stem to stern by waves was overborne: <br />
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn, <br />
Was headlong hurl&#8217;d; thrice round the ship was toss&#8217;d, <br />
Then bulg&#8217;d at once, and in the deep was lost; <br />
And here and there above the waves were seen <br />
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men. <br />
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, <br />
And suck&#8217;d thro&#8217; loosen&#8217;d planks the rushing sea. <br />
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old, <br />
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold, <br />
Endur&#8217;d not less; their ships, with gaping seams, <br />
Admit the deluge of the briny streams. <br />
Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound <br />
Of raging billows breaking on the ground. <br />
Displeas&#8217;d, and fearing for his wat&#8217;ry reign, <br />
He rear&#8217;d his awful head above the main, <br />
Serene in majesty; then roll&#8217;d his eyes <br />
Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies. <br />
He saw the Trojan fleet dispers&#8217;d, distress&#8217;d, <br />
By stormy winds and wintry heav&#8217;n oppress&#8217;d. <br />
Full well the god his sister&#8217;s envy knew, <br />
And what her aims and what her arts pursue. <br />
He summon&#8217;d Eurus and the western blast, <br />
And first an angry glance on both he cast; <br />
Then thus rebuk&#8217;d: &#8220;Audacious winds! from whence <br />
This bold attempt, this rebel insolence? <br />
Is it for you to ravage seas and land, <br />
Unauthoriz&#8217;d by my supreme command? <br />
To raise such mountains on the troubled main? <br />
Whom I&#8211;but first &#8216;t is fit the billows to restrain; <br />
And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign. <br />
Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear&#8211; <br />
The realms of ocean and the fields of air <br />
Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me <br />
The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. <br />
His pow&#8217;r to hollow caverns is confin&#8217;d: <br />
There let him reign, the jailer of the wind, <br />
With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, <br />
And boast and bluster in his empty hall.&#8221; <br />
He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth&#8217;d the sea, <br />
Dispell&#8217;d the darkness, and restor&#8217;d the day. <br />
Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train <br />
Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, <br />
Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: <br />
The god himself with ready trident stands, <br />
And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; <br />
Then heaves them off the shoals. Where&#8217;er he guides <br />
His finny coursers and in triumph rides, <br />
The waves unruffle and the sea subsides. <br />
As, when in tumults rise th&#8217; ignoble crowd, <br />
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; <br />
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, <br />
And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: <br />
If then some grave and pious man appear, <br />
They hush their noise, and lend a list&#8217;ning ear; <br />
He soothes with sober words their angry mood, <br />
And quenches their innate desire of blood: <br />
So, when the Father of the Flood appears, <br />
And o&#8217;er the seas his sov&#8217;reign trident rears, <br />
Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, <br />
High on his chariot, and, with loosen&#8217;d reins, <br />
Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains. <br />
The weary Trojans ply their shatter&#8217;d oars <br />
To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores. <br />
Within a long recess there lies a bay: <br />
An island shades it from the rolling sea, <br />
And forms a port secure for ships to ride; <br />
Broke by the jutting land, on either side, <br />
In double streams the briny waters glide. <br />
Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene <br />
Appears above, and groves for ever green: <br />
A grot is form&#8217;d beneath, with mossy seats, <br />
To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats. <br />
Down thro&#8217; the crannies of the living walls <br />
The crystal streams descend in murm&#8217;ring falls: <br />
No haulsers need to bind the vessels here, <br />
Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. <br />
Sev&#8217;n ships within this happy harbor meet, <br />
The thin remainders of the scatter&#8217;d fleet. <br />
The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, <br />
Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish&#8217;d repose. <br />
First, good Achates, with repeated strokes <br />
Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: <br />
Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither&#8217;d leaves <br />
The dying sparkles in their fall receives: <br />
Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise, <br />
And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies. <br />
The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around <br />
The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground: <br />
Some dry their corn, infected with the brine, <br />
Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. <br />
AEneas climbs the mountain&#8217;s airy brow, <br />
And takes a prospect of the seas below, <br />
If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy, <br />
Or see the streamers of Caicus fly. <br />
No vessels were in view; but, on the plain, <br />
Three beamy stags command a lordly train <br />
Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng <br />
Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. <br />
He stood; and, while secure they fed below, <br />
He took the quiver and the trusty bow <br />
Achates us&#8217;d to bear: the leaders first <br />
He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc&#8217;d; <br />
Nor ceas&#8217;d his arrows, till the shady plain <br />
Sev&#8217;n mighty bodies with their blood distain. <br />
For the sev&#8217;n ships he made an equal share, <br />
And to the port return&#8217;d, triumphant from the war. <br />
The jars of gen&#8217;rous wine (Acestes&#8217; gift, <br />
When his Trinacrian shores the navy left) <br />
He set abroach, and for the feast prepar&#8217;d, <br />
In equal portions with the ven&#8217;son shar&#8217;d. <br />
Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief <br />
With cheerful words allay&#8217;d the common grief: <br />
&#8220;Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose <br />
To future good our past and present woes. <br />
With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried; <br />
Th&#8217; inhuman Cyclops and his den defied. <br />
What greater ills hereafter can you bear? <br />
Resume your courage and dismiss your care, <br />
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate <br />
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. <br />
Thro&#8217; various hazards and events, we move <br />
To Latium and the realms foredoom&#8217;d by Jove. <br />
Call&#8217;d to the seat (the promise of the skies) <br />
Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, <br />
Endure the hardships of your present state; <br />
Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate.&#8221; <br />
These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart; <br />
His outward smiles conceal&#8217;d his inward smart. <br />
The jolly crew, unmindful of the past, <br />
The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. <br />
Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; <br />
The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil; <br />
Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil. <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on the grassy turf, at ease they dine, <br />
Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine. <br />
Their hunger thus appeas&#8217;d, their care attends <br />
The doubtful fortune of their absent friends: <br />
Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess, <br />
Whether to deem &#8216;em dead, or in distress. <br />
Above the rest, AEneas mourns the fate <br />
Of brave Orontes, and th&#8217; uncertain state <br />
Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus. <br />
The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus. <br />
When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys <br />
Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, <br />
At length on Libyan realms he fix&#8217;d his eyes&#8211; <br />
Whom, pond&#8217;ring thus on human miseries, <br />
When Venus saw, she with a lowly look, <br />
Not free from tears, her heav&#8217;nly sire bespoke: <br />
&#8220;O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand <br />
Disperses thunder on the seas and land, <br />
Disposing all with absolute command; <br />
How could my pious son thy pow&#8217;r incense? <br />
Or what, alas! is vanish&#8217;d Troy&#8217;s offense? <br />
Our hope of Italy not only lost, <br />
On various seas by various tempests toss&#8217;d, <br />
But shut from ev&#8217;ry shore, and barr&#8217;d from ev&#8217;ry coast. <br />
You promis&#8217;d once, a progeny divine <br />
Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line, <br />
In after times should hold the world in awe, <br />
And to the land and ocean give the law. <br />
How is your doom revers&#8217;d, which eas&#8217;d my care <br />
When Troy was ruin&#8217;d in that cruel war? <br />
Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now, <br />
When Fortune still pursues her former blow, <br />
What can I hope? What worse can still succeed? <br />
What end of labors has your will decreed? <br />
Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts, <br />
Could pass secure, and pierce th&#8217; Illyrian coasts, <br />
Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves <br />
And thro&#8217; nine channels disembogues his waves. <br />
At length he founded Padua&#8217;s happy seat, <br />
And gave his Trojans a secure retreat; <br />
There fix&#8217;d their arms, and there renew&#8217;d their name, <br />
And there in quiet rules, and crown&#8217;d with fame. <br />
But we, descended from your sacred line, <br />
Entitled to your heav&#8217;n and rites divine, <br />
Are banish&#8217;d earth; and, for the wrath of one, <br />
Remov&#8217;d from Latium and the promis&#8217;d throne. <br />
Are these our scepters? these our due rewards? <br />
And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?&#8221; <br />
To whom the Father of th&#8217; immortal race, <br />
Smiling with that serene indulgent face, <br />
With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies, <br />
First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies: <br />
&#8220;Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire <br />
The fates of thine are fix&#8217;d, and stand entire. <br />
Thou shalt behold thy wish&#8217;d Lavinian walls; <br />
And, ripe for heav&#8217;n, when fate AEneas calls, <br />
Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: <br />
No councils have revers&#8217;d my firm decree. <br />
And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state, <br />
Know, I have search&#8217;d the mystic rolls of Fate: <br />
Thy son (nor is th&#8217; appointed season far) <br />
In Italy shall wage successful war, <br />
Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field, <br />
And sov&#8217;reign laws impose, and cities build, <br />
Till, after ev&#8217;ry foe subdued, the sun <br />
Thrice thro&#8217; the signs his annual race shall run: <br />
This is his time prefix&#8217;d. Ascanius then, <br />
Now call&#8217;d Iulus, shall begin his reign. <br />
He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear, <br />
Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer, <br />
And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build. <br />
The throne with his succession shall be fill&#8217;d <br />
Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen <br />
Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen, <br />
Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes, <br />
Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. <br />
The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain: <br />
Then Romulus his grandsire&#8217;s throne shall gain, <br />
Of martial tow&#8217;rs the founder shall become, <br />
The people Romans call, the city Rome. <br />
To them no bounds of empire I assign, <br />
Nor term of years to their immortal line. <br />
Ev&#8217;n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils, <br />
Earth, seas, and heav&#8217;n, and Jove himself turmoils; <br />
At length aton&#8217;d, her friendly pow&#8217;r shall join, <br />
To cherish and advance the Trojan line. <br />
The subject world shall Rome&#8217;s dominion own, <br />
And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown. <br />
An age is ripening in revolving fate <br />
When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state, <br />
And sweet revenge her conqu&#8217;ring sons shall call, <br />
To crush the people that conspir&#8217;d her fall. <br />
Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise, <br />
Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies <br />
Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils, <br />
Our heav&#8217;n, the just reward of human toils, <br />
Securely shall repay with rites divine; <br />
And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine. <br />
Then dire debate and impious war shall cease, <br />
And the stern age be soften&#8217;d into peace: <br />
Then banish&#8217;d Faith shall once again return, <br />
And Vestal fires in hallow&#8217;d temples burn; <br />
And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain <br />
The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain. <br />
Janus himself before his fane shall wait, <br />
And keep the dreadful issues of his gate, <br />
With bolts and iron bars: within remains <br />
Imprison&#8217;d Fury, bound in brazen chains; <br />
High on a trophy rais&#8217;d, of useless arms, <br />
He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms.&#8221; <br />
He said, and sent Cyllenius with command <br />
To free the ports, and ope the Punic land <br />
To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate, <br />
The queen might force them from her town and state. <br />
Down from the steep of heav&#8217;n Cyllenius flies, <br />
And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies. <br />
Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god, <br />
Performs his message, and displays his rod: <br />
The surly murmurs of the people cease; <br />
And, as the fates requir&#8217;d, they give the peace: <br />
The queen herself suspends the rigid laws, <br />
The Trojans pities, and protects their cause. <br />
Meantime, in shades of night AEneas lies: <br />
Care seiz&#8217;d his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes. <br />
But, when the sun restor&#8217;d the cheerful day, <br />
He rose, the coast and country to survey, <br />
Anxious and eager to discover more. <br />
It look&#8217;d a wild uncultivated shore; <br />
But, whether humankind, or beasts alone <br />
Possess&#8217;d the new-found region, was unknown. <br />
Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: <br />
Tall trees surround the mountain&#8217;s shady sides; <br />
The bending brow above a safe retreat provides. <br />
Arm&#8217;d with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends, <br />
And true Achates on his steps attends. <br />
Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood, <br />
Before his eyes his goddess mother stood: <br />
A huntress in her habit and her mien; <br />
Her dress a maid, her air confess&#8217;d a queen. <br />
Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; <br />
Loose was her hair, and wanton&#8217;d in the wind; <br />
Her hand sustain&#8217;d a bow; her quiver hung behind. <br />
She seem&#8217;d a virgin of the Spartan blood: <br />
With such array Harpalyce bestrode <br />
Her Thracian courser and outstripp&#8217;d the rapid flood. <br />
&#8220;Ho, strangers! have you lately seen,&#8221; she said, <br />
&#8220;One of my sisters, like myself array&#8217;d, <br />
Who cross&#8217;d the lawn, or in the forest stray&#8217;d? <br />
A painted quiver at her back she bore; <br />
Varied with spots, a lynx&#8217;s hide she wore; <br />
And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.&#8221; <br />
Thus Venus: thus her son replied again: <br />
&#8220;None of your sisters have we heard or seen, <br />
O virgin! or what other name you bear <br />
Above that style&#8211;O more than mortal fair! <br />
Your voice and mien celestial birth betray! <br />
If, as you seem, the sister of the day, <br />
Or one at least of chaste Diana&#8217;s train, <br />
Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain; <br />
But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss&#8217;d, <br />
What earth we tread, and who commands the coast? <br />
Then on your name shall wretched mortals call, <br />
And offer&#8217;d victims at your altars fall.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;I dare not,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;assume the name <br />
Of goddess, or celestial honors claim: <br />
For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear, <br />
And purple buskins o&#8217;er their ankles wear. <br />
Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are&#8211; <br />
A people rude in peace, and rough in war. <br />
The rising city, which from far you see, <br />
Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. <br />
Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, <br />
Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother&#8217;s hate. <br />
Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; <br />
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known <br />
For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, <br />
Possess&#8217;d fair Dido&#8217;s bed; and either heart <br />
At once was wounded with an equal dart. <br />
Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; <br />
Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway&#8217;d: <br />
One who contemn&#8217;d divine and human laws. <br />
Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. <br />
The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, <br />
With steel invades his brother&#8217;s life by stealth; <br />
Before the sacred altar made him bleed, <br />
And long from her conceal&#8217;d the cruel deed. <br />
Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin&#8217;d, <br />
To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. <br />
At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears <br />
Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares, <br />
And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. <br />
The cruel altars and his fate he tells, <br />
And the dire secret of his house reveals, <br />
Then warns the widow, with her household gods, <br />
To seek a refuge in remote abodes. <br />
Last, to support her in so long a way, <br />
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. <br />
Admonish&#8217;d thus, and seiz&#8217;d with mortal fright, <br />
The queen provides companions of her flight: <br />
They meet, and all combine to leave the state, <br />
Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. <br />
They seize a fleet, which ready rigg&#8217;d they find; <br />
Nor is Pygmalion&#8217;s treasure left behind. <br />
The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea <br />
With prosp&#8217;rous winds; a woman leads the way. <br />
I know not, if by stress of weather driv&#8217;n, <br />
Or was their fatal course dispos&#8217;d by Heav&#8217;n; <br />
At last they landed, where from far your eyes <br />
May view the turrets of new Carthage rise; <br />
There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call&#8217;d, <br />
From the bull&#8217;s hide) they first inclos&#8217;d, and wall&#8217;d. <br />
But whence are you? what country claims your birth? <br />
What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?&#8221; <br />
To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, <br />
And deeply sighing, thus her son replies: <br />
&#8220;Could you with patience hear, or I relate, <br />
O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! <br />
Thro&#8217; such a train of woes if I should run, <br />
The day would sooner than the tale be done! <br />
From ancient Troy, by force expell&#8217;d, we came&#8211; <br />
If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. <br />
On various seas by various tempests toss&#8217;d, <br />
At length we landed on your Libyan coast. <br />
The good AEneas am I call&#8217;d&#8211;a name, <br />
While Fortune favor&#8217;d, not unknown to fame. <br />
My household gods, companions of my woes, <br />
With pious care I rescued from our foes. <br />
To fruitful Italy my course was bent; <br />
And from the King of Heav&#8217;n is my descent. <br />
With twice ten sail I cross&#8217;d the Phrygian sea; <br />
Fate and my mother goddess led my way. <br />
Scarce sev&#8217;n, the thin remainders of my fleet, <br />
From storms preserv&#8217;d, within your harbor meet. <br />
Myself distress&#8217;d, an exile, and unknown, <br />
Debarr&#8217;d from Europe, and from Asia thrown, <br />
In Libyan desarts wander thus alone.&#8221; <br />
His tender parent could no longer bear; <br />
But, interposing, sought to soothe his care. <br />
&#8220;Whoe&#8217;er you are&#8211;not unbelov&#8217;d by Heav&#8217;n, <br />
Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv&#8217;n&#8211; <br />
Have courage: to the gods permit the rest, <br />
And to the queen expose your just request. <br />
Now take this earnest of success, for more: <br />
Your scatter&#8217;d fleet is join&#8217;d upon the shore; <br />
The winds are chang&#8217;d, your friends from danger free; <br />
Or I renounce my skill in augury. <br />
Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, <br />
And stoop with closing pinions from above; <br />
Whom late the bird of Jove had driv&#8217;n along, <br />
And thro&#8217; the clouds pursued the scatt&#8217;ring throng: <br />
Now, all united in a goodly team, <br />
They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. <br />
As they, with joy returning, clap their wings, <br />
And ride the circuit of the skies in rings; <br />
Not otherwise your ships, and ev&#8217;ry friend, <br />
Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. <br />
No more advice is needful; but pursue <br />
The path before you, and the town in view.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, she turn&#8217;d, and made appear <br />
Her neck refulgent, and dishevel&#8217;d hair, <br />
Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach&#8217;d the ground. <br />
And widely spread ambrosial scents around: <br />
In length of train descends her sweeping gown; <br />
And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. <br />
The prince pursued the parting deity <br />
With words like these: &#8220;Ah! whither do you fly? <br />
Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son <br />
In borrow&#8217;d shapes, and his embrace to shun; <br />
Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown; <br />
And still to speak in accents not your own.&#8221; <br />
Against the goddess these complaints he made, <br />
But took the path, and her commands obey&#8217;d. <br />
They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds <br />
With mists their persons, and involves in clouds, <br />
That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay, <br />
Or force to tell the causes of their way. <br />
This part perform&#8217;d, the goddess flies sublime <br />
To visit Paphos and her native clime; <br />
Where garlands, ever green and ever fair, <br />
With vows are offer&#8217;d, and with solemn pray&#8217;r: <br />
A hundred altars in her temple smoke; <br />
A thousand bleeding hearts her pow&#8217;r invoke. <br />
They climb the next ascent, and, looking down, <br />
Now at a nearer distance view the town. <br />
The prince with wonder sees the stately tow&#8217;rs, <br />
Which late were huts and shepherds&#8217; homely bow&#8217;rs, <br />
The gates and streets; and hears, from ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
The noise and busy concourse of the mart. <br />
The toiling Tyrians on each other call <br />
To ply their labor: some extend the wall; <br />
Some build the citadel; the brawny throng <br />
Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along. <br />
Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground, <br />
Which, first design&#8217;d, with ditches they surround. <br />
Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice <br />
Of holy senates, and elect by voice. <br />
Here some design a mole, while others there <br />
Lay deep foundations for a theater; <br />
From marble quarries mighty columns hew, <br />
For ornaments of scenes, and future view. <br />
Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, <br />
As exercise the bees in flow&#8217;ry plains, <br />
When winter past, and summer scarce begun, <br />
Invites them forth to labor in the sun; <br />
Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense <br />
Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; <br />
Some at the gate stand ready to receive <br />
The golden burthen, and their friends relieve; <br />
All with united force, combine to drive <br />
The lazy drones from the laborious hive: <br />
With envy stung, they view each other&#8217;s deeds; <br />
The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. <br />
&#8220;Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!&#8221; <br />
AEneas said, and view&#8217;d, with lifted eyes, <br />
Their lofty tow&#8217;rs; then, ent&#8217;ring at the gate, <br />
Conceal&#8217;d in clouds (prodigious to relate) <br />
He mix&#8217;d, unmark&#8217;d, among the busy throng, <br />
Borne by the tide, and pass&#8217;d unseen along. <br />
Full in the center of the town there stood, <br />
Thick set with trees, a venerable wood. <br />
The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, <br />
And digging here, a prosp&#8217;rous omen found: <br />
From under earth a courser&#8217;s head they drew, <br />
Their growth and future fortune to foreshew. <br />
This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, <br />
Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave. <br />
Sidonian Dido here with solemn state <br />
Did Juno&#8217;s temple build, and consecrate, <br />
Enrich&#8217;d with gifts, and with a golden shrine; <br />
But more the goddess made the place divine. <br />
On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, <br />
And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: <br />
The rafters are with brazen cov&#8217;rings crown&#8217;d; <br />
The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. <br />
What first AEneas in this place beheld, <br />
Reviv&#8217;d his courage, and his fear expell&#8217;d. <br />
For while, expecting there the queen, he rais&#8217;d <br />
His wond&#8217;ring eyes, and round the temple gaz&#8217;d, <br />
Admir&#8217;d the fortune of the rising town, <br />
The striving artists, and their arts&#8217; renown; <br />
He saw, in order painted on the wall, <br />
Whatever did unhappy Troy befall: <br />
The wars that fame around the world had blown, <br />
All to the life, and ev&#8217;ry leader known. <br />
There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies, <br />
And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies. <br />
He stopp&#8217;d, and weeping said: &#8220;O friend! ev&#8217;n here <br />
The monuments of Trojan woes appear! <br />
Our known disasters fill ev&#8217;n foreign lands: <br />
See there, where old unhappy Priam stands! <br />
Ev&#8217;n the mute walls relate the warrior&#8217;s fame, <br />
And Trojan griefs the Tyrians&#8217; pity claim.&#8221; <br />
He said (his tears a ready passage find), <br />
Devouring what he saw so well design&#8217;d, <br />
And with an empty picture fed his mind: <br />
For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield, <br />
And here the trembling Trojans quit the field, <br />
Pursued by fierce Achilles thro&#8217; the plain, <br />
On his high chariot driving o&#8217;er the slain. <br />
The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew, <br />
By their white sails betray&#8217;d to nightly view; <br />
And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword <br />
The sentries slew, nor spar&#8217;d their slumb&#8217;ring lord, <br />
Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food <br />
Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood. <br />
Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied <br />
Achilles, and unequal combat tried; <br />
Then, where the boy disarm&#8217;d, with loosen&#8217;d reins, <br />
Was by his horses hurried o&#8217;er the plains, <br />
Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg&#8217;d around: <br />
The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound, <br />
With tracks of blood inscrib&#8217;d the dusty ground. <br />
Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress&#8217;d with woe, <br />
To Pallas&#8217; fane in long procession go, <br />
In hopes to reconcile their heav&#8217;nly foe. <br />
They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair, <br />
And rich embroider&#8217;d vests for presents bear; <br />
But the stern goddess stands unmov&#8217;d with pray&#8217;r. <br />
Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew <br />
The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew. <br />
Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, <br />
The lifeless body of his son is sold. <br />
So sad an object, and so well express&#8217;d, <br />
Drew sighs and groans from the griev&#8217;d hero&#8217;s breast, <br />
To see the figure of his lifeless friend, <br />
And his old sire his helpless hand extend. <br />
Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train, <br />
Mix&#8217;d in the bloody battle on the plain; <br />
And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew, <br />
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew. <br />
Penthisilea there, with haughty grace, <br />
Leads to the wars an Amazonian race. <br />
In their right hands a pointed dart they wield; <br />
The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. <br />
Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws, <br />
Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes, <br />
And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. <br />
Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, <br />
Fix&#8217;d on the walls with wonder and surprise, <br />
The beauteous Dido, with a num&#8217;rous train <br />
And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane. <br />
Such on Eurotas&#8217; banks, or Cynthus&#8217; height, <br />
Diana seems; and so she charms the sight, <br />
When in the dance the graceful goddess leads <br />
The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads: <br />
Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, <br />
She walks majestic, and she looks their queen; <br />
Latona sees her shine above the rest, <br />
And feeds with secret joy her silent breast. <br />
Such Dido was; with such becoming state, <br />
Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. <br />
Their labor to her future sway she speeds, <br />
And passing with a gracious glance proceeds; <br />
Then mounts the throne, high plac&#8217;d before the shrine: <br />
In crowds around, the swarming people join. <br />
She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, <br />
Hears and determines ev&#8217;ry private cause; <br />
Their tasks in equal portions she divides, <br />
And, where unequal, there by lots decides. <br />
Another way by chance AEneas bends <br />
His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, <br />
Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong, <br />
And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, <br />
Whom late the tempest on the billows toss&#8217;d, <br />
And widely scatter&#8217;d on another coast. <br />
The prince, unseen, surpris&#8217;d with wonder stands, <br />
And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands; <br />
But, doubtful of the wish&#8217;d event, he stays, <br />
And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, <br />
Impatient till they told their present state, <br />
And where they left their ships, and what their fate, <br />
And why they came, and what was their request; <br />
For these were sent, commission&#8217;d by the rest, <br />
To sue for leave to land their sickly men, <br />
And gain admission to the gracious queen. <br />
Ent&#8217;ring, with cries they fill&#8217;d the holy fane; <br />
Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began: <br />
&#8220;O queen! indulg&#8217;d by favor of the gods <br />
To found an empire in these new abodes, <br />
To build a town, with statutes to restrain <br />
The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, <br />
We wretched Trojans, toss&#8217;d on ev&#8217;ry shore, <br />
From sea to sea, thy clemency implore. <br />
Forbid the fires our shipping to deface! <br />
Receive th&#8217; unhappy fugitives to grace, <br />
And spare the remnant of a pious race! <br />
We come not with design of wasteful prey, <br />
To drive the country, force the swains away: <br />
Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire; <br />
The vanquish&#8217;d dare not to such thoughts aspire. <br />
A land there is, Hesperia nam&#8217;d of old; <br />
The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold&#8211; <br />
Th&#8217; OEnotrians held it once&#8211;by common fame <br />
Now call&#8217;d Italia, from the leader&#8217;s name. <br />
To that sweet region was our voyage bent, <br />
When winds and ev&#8217;ry warring element <br />
Disturb&#8217;d our course, and, far from sight of land, <br />
Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand: <br />
The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, <br />
Dispers&#8217;d and dash&#8217;d the rest upon the rocky shore. <br />
Those few you see escap&#8217;d the storm, and fear, <br />
Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. <br />
What men, what monsters, what inhuman race, <br />
What laws, what barb&#8217;rous customs of the place, <br />
Shut up a desart shore to drowning men, <br />
And drive us to the cruel seas again? <br />
If our hard fortune no compassion draws, <br />
Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws, <br />
The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. <br />
AEneas was our prince: a juster lord, <br />
Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword; <br />
Observant of the right, religious of his word. <br />
If yet he lives, and draws this vital air, <br />
Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair; <br />
Nor you, great queen, these offices repent, <br />
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment. <br />
We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts, <br />
Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. <br />
Permit our ships a shelter on your shores, <br />
Refitted from your woods with planks and oars, <br />
That, if our prince be safe, we may renew <br />
Our destin&#8217;d course, and Italy pursue. <br />
But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain <br />
That thou art swallow&#8217;d in the Libyan main, <br />
And if our young Iulus be no more, <br />
Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore, <br />
That we to good Acestes may return, <br />
And with our friends our common losses mourn.&#8221; <br />
Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew <br />
With cries and clamors his request renew. <br />
The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes, <br />
Ponder&#8217;d the speech; then briefly thus replies: <br />
&#8220;Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate, <br />
And doubts attending an unsettled state, <br />
Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes. <br />
Who has not heard the story of your woes, <br />
The name and fortune of your native place, <br />
The fame and valor of the Phrygian race? <br />
We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense, <br />
Nor so remote from Phoebus&#8217; influence. <br />
Whether to Latian shores your course is bent, <br />
Or, driv&#8217;n by tempests from your first intent, <br />
You seek the good Acestes&#8217; government, <br />
Your men shall be receiv&#8217;d, your fleet repair&#8217;d, <br />
And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: <br />
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow&#8217;rs <br />
To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow&#8217;rs, <br />
My wealth, my city, and myself are yours. <br />
And would to Heav&#8217;n, the storm, you felt, would bring <br />
On Carthaginian coasts your wand&#8217;ring king. <br />
My people shall, by my command, explore <br />
The ports and creeks of ev&#8217;ry winding shore, <br />
And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest <br />
Of so renown&#8217;d and so desir&#8217;d a guest.&#8221; <br />
Rais&#8217;d in his mind the Trojan hero stood, <br />
And long&#8217;d to break from out his ambient cloud: <br />
Achates found it, and thus urg&#8217;d his way: <br />
&#8220;From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? <br />
What more can you desire, your welcome sure, <br />
Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure? <br />
One only wants; and him we saw in vain <br />
Oppose the storm, and swallow&#8217;d in the main. <br />
Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid; <br />
The rest agrees with what your mother said.&#8221; <br />
Scarce had be spoken, when the cloud gave way, <br />
The mists flew upward and dissolv&#8217;d in day. <br />
The Trojan chief appear&#8217;d in open sight, <br />
August in visage, and serenely bright. <br />
His mother goddess, with her hands divine, <br />
Had form&#8217;d his curling locks, and made his temples shine, <br />
And giv&#8217;n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace, <br />
And breath&#8217;d a youthful vigor on his face; <br />
Like polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry, beauteous to behold, <br />
Or Parian marble, when enchas&#8217;d in gold: <br />
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, <br />
And thus with manly modesty he spoke: <br />
&#8220;He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss&#8217;d, <br />
And sav&#8217;d from shipwreck on your Libyan coast; <br />
Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne, <br />
A prince that owes his life to you alone. <br />
Fair majesty, the refuge and redress <br />
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress, <br />
You, who your pious offices employ <br />
To save the relics of abandon&#8217;d Troy; <br />
Receive the shipwreck&#8217;d on your friendly shore, <br />
With hospitable rites relieve the poor; <br />
Associate in your town a wand&#8217;ring train, <br />
And strangers in your palace entertain: <br />
What thanks can wretched fugitives return, <br />
Who, scatter&#8217;d thro&#8217; the world, in exile mourn? <br />
The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin&#8217;d; <br />
If acts of mercy touch their heav&#8217;nly mind, <br />
And, more than all the gods, your gen&#8217;rous heart, <br />
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! <br />
In you this age is happy, and this earth, <br />
And parents more than mortal gave you birth. <br />
While rolling rivers into seas shall run, <br />
And round the space of heav&#8217;n the radiant sun; <br />
While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, <br />
Your honor, name, and praise shall never die. <br />
Whate&#8217;er abode my fortune has assign&#8217;d, <br />
Your image shall be present in my mind.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, he turn&#8217;d with pious haste, <br />
And joyful his expecting friends embrac&#8217;d: <br />
With his right hand Ilioneus was grac&#8217;d, <br />
Serestus with his left; then to his breast <br />
Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press&#8217;d; <br />
And so by turns descended to the rest. <br />
The Tyrian queen stood fix&#8217;d upon his face, <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with his motions, ravish&#8217;d with his grace; <br />
Admir&#8217;d his fortunes, more admir&#8217;d the man; <br />
Then recollected stood, and thus began: <br />
&#8220;What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow&#8217;rs <br />
Have cast you shipwrack&#8217;d on our barren shores? <br />
Are you the great AEneas, known to fame, <br />
Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? <br />
The same AEneas whom fair Venus bore <br />
To fam&#8217;d Anchises on th&#8217; Idaean shore? <br />
It calls into my mind, tho&#8217; then a child, <br />
When Teucer came, from Salamis exil&#8217;d, <br />
And sought my father&#8217;s aid, to be restor&#8217;d: <br />
My father Belus then with fire and sword <br />
Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, <br />
And, conqu&#8217;ring, finish&#8217;d the successful war. <br />
From him the Trojan siege I understood, <br />
The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. <br />
Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais&#8217;d, <br />
And his own ancestry from Trojans rais&#8217;d. <br />
Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, <br />
If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: <br />
For I myself, like you, have been distress&#8217;d, <br />
Till Heav&#8217;n afforded me this place of rest; <br />
Like you, an alien in a land unknown, <br />
I learn to pity woes so like my own.&#8221; <br />
She said, and to the palace led her guest; <br />
Then offer&#8217;d incense, and proclaim&#8217;d a feast. <br />
Nor yet less careful for her absent friends, <br />
Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; <br />
Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs, <br />
With bleating cries, attend their milky dams; <br />
And jars of gen&#8217;rous wine and spacious bowls <br />
She gives, to cheer the sailors&#8217; drooping souls. <br />
Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls, <br />
And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls: <br />
On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine; <br />
With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine, <br />
And antique vases, all of gold emboss&#8217;d <br />
(The gold itself inferior to the cost), <br />
Of curious work, where on the sides were seen <br />
The fights and figures of illustrious men, <br />
From their first founder to the present queen. <br />
The good AEneas, whose paternal care <br />
Iulus&#8217; absence could no longer bear, <br />
Dispatch&#8217;d Achates to the ships in haste, <br />
To give a glad relation of the past, <br />
And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy, <br />
Snatch&#8217;d from the ruins of unhappy Troy: <br />
A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; <br />
An upper vest, once Helen&#8217;s rich attire, <br />
From Argos by the fam&#8217;d adultress brought, <br />
With golden flow&#8217;rs and winding foliage wrought, <br />
Her mother Leda&#8217;s present, when she came <br />
To ruin Troy and set the world on flame; <br />
The scepter Priam&#8217;s eldest daughter bore, <br />
Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore; <br />
Of double texture, glorious to behold, <br />
One order set with gems, and one with gold. <br />
Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes, <br />
And in his diligence his duty shows. <br />
But Venus, anxious for her son&#8217;s affairs, <br />
New counsels tries, and new designs prepares: <br />
That Cupid should assume the shape and face <br />
Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; <br />
Should bring the presents, in her nephew&#8217;s stead, <br />
And in Eliza&#8217;s veins the gentle poison shed: <br />
For much she fear&#8217;d the Tyrians, double-tongued, <br />
And knew the town to Juno&#8217;s care belong&#8217;d. <br />
These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke, <br />
And thus alarm&#8217;d, to winged Love she spoke: <br />
&#8220;My son, my strength, whose mighty pow&#8217;r alone <br />
Controls the Thund&#8217;rer on his awful throne, <br />
To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies, <br />
And on thy succor and thy faith relies. <br />
Thou know&#8217;st, my son, how Jove&#8217;s revengeful wife, <br />
By force and fraud, attempts thy brother&#8217;s life; <br />
And often hast thou mourn&#8217;d with me his pains. <br />
Him Dido now with blandishment detains; <br />
But I suspect the town where Juno reigns. <br />
For this &#8216;t is needful to prevent her art, <br />
And fire with love the proud Phoenician&#8217;s heart: <br />
A love so violent, so strong, so sure, <br />
As neither age can change, nor art can cure. <br />
How this may be perform&#8217;d, now take my mind: <br />
Ascanius by his father is design&#8217;d <br />
To come, with presents laden, from the port, <br />
To gratify the queen, and gain the court. <br />
I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, <br />
And, ravish&#8217;d, in Idalian bow&#8217;rs to keep, <br />
Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit <br />
May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat. <br />
Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace <br />
But only for a night&#8217;s revolving space: <br />
Thyself a boy, assume a boy&#8217;s dissembled face; <br />
That when, amidst the fervor of the feast, <br />
The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, <br />
And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains, <br />
Thou may&#8217;st infuse thy venom in her veins.&#8221; <br />
The God of Love obeys, and sets aside <br />
His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride; <br />
He walks Iulus in his mother&#8217;s sight, <br />
And in the sweet resemblance takes delight. <br />
The goddess then to young Ascanius flies, <br />
And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes: <br />
Lull&#8217;d in her lap, amidst a train of Loves, <br />
She gently bears him to her blissful groves, <br />
Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head, <br />
And softly lays him on a flow&#8217;ry bed. <br />
Cupid meantime assum&#8217;d his form and face, <br />
Foll&#8217;wing Achates with a shorter pace, <br />
And brought the gifts. The queen already sate <br />
Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state, <br />
High on a golden bed: her princely guest <br />
Was next her side; in order sate the rest. <br />
Then canisters with bread are heap&#8217;d on high; <br />
Th&#8217; attendants water for their hands supply, <br />
And, having wash&#8217;d, with silken towels dry. <br />
Next fifty handmaids in long order bore <br />
The censers, and with fumes the gods adore: <br />
Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join <br />
To place the dishes, and to serve the wine. <br />
The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast, <br />
Approach, and on the painted couches rest. <br />
All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, <br />
But view the beauteous boy with more amaze, <br />
His rosy-color&#8217;d cheeks, his radiant eyes, <br />
His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god&#8217;s disguise; <br />
Nor pass unprais&#8217;d the vest and veil divine, <br />
Which wand&#8217;ring foliage and rich flow&#8217;rs entwine. <br />
But, far above the rest, the royal dame, <br />
(Already doom&#8217;d to love&#8217;s disastrous flame,) <br />
With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, <br />
Beholds the presents, and admires the boy. <br />
The guileful god about the hero long, <br />
With children&#8217;s play, and false embraces, hung; <br />
Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms <br />
With greedy pleasure, and devour&#8217;d his charms. <br />
Unhappy Dido little thought what guest, <br />
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast; <br />
But he, not mindless of his mother&#8217;s pray&#8217;r, <br />
Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, <br />
And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care. <br />
The dead is to the living love resign&#8217;d; <br />
And all AEneas enters in her mind. <br />
Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas&#8217;d, <br />
The meat remov&#8217;d, and ev&#8217;ry guest was pleas&#8217;d, <br />
The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown&#8217;d, <br />
And thro&#8217; the palace cheerful cries resound. <br />
From gilded roofs depending lamps display <br />
Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day. <br />
A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine, <br />
The queen commanded to be crown&#8217;d with wine: <br />
The bowl that Belus us&#8217;d, and all the Tyrian line. <br />
Then, silence thro&#8217; the hall proclaim&#8217;d, she spoke: <br />
&#8220;O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke, <br />
With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow&#8217;r; <br />
Bless to both nations this auspicious hour! <br />
So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line <br />
In lasting concord from this day combine. <br />
Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer, <br />
And gracious Juno, both be present here! <br />
And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address <br />
To Heav&#8217;n with mine, to ratify the peace.&#8221; <br />
The goblet then she took, with nectar crown&#8217;d <br />
(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,) <br />
And rais&#8217;d it to her mouth with sober grace; <br />
Then, sipping, offer&#8217;d to the next in place. <br />
&#8216;T was Bitias whom she call&#8217;d, a thirsty soul; <br />
He took the challenge, and embrac&#8217;d the bowl, <br />
With pleasure swill&#8217;d the gold, nor ceas&#8217;d to draw, <br />
Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw. <br />
The goblet goes around: Iopas brought <br />
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught: <br />
The various labors of the wand&#8217;ring moon, <br />
And whence proceed th&#8217; eclipses of the sun; <br />
Th&#8217; original of men and beasts; and whence <br />
The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense, <br />
And fix&#8217;d and erring stars dispose their influence; <br />
What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays <br />
The summer nights and shortens winter days. <br />
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song: <br />
Those peals are echo&#8217;d by the Trojan throng. <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy queen with talk prolong&#8217;d the night, <br />
And drank large draughts of love with vast delight; <br />
Of Priam much enquir&#8217;d, of Hector more; <br />
Then ask&#8217;d what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, <br />
What troops he landed on the Trojan shore; <br />
The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse, <br />
And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force; <br />
At length, as fate and her ill stars requir&#8217;d, <br />
To hear the series of the war desir&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;Relate at large, my godlike guest,&#8221; she said, <br />
&#8220;The Grecian stratagems, the town betray&#8217;d: <br />
The fatal issue of so long a war, <br />
Your flight, your wand&#8217;rings, and your woes, declare; <br />
For, since on ev&#8217;ry sea, on ev&#8217;ry coast, <br />
Your men have been distress&#8217;d, your navy toss&#8217;d, <br />
Sev&#8217;n times the sun has either tropic view&#8217;d, <br />
The winter banish&#8217;d, and the spring renew&#8217;d.&#8221;</p>
