				<p>THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; The war being now begun, both the generals<br />
make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. AEneas<br />
goes in person to beg succors from Evander and the Tuscans.<br />
Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends<br />
his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes<br />
arms for her son AEneas, and draws on his shield the most memora-<br />
ble actions of his posterity.</p>
<p>WHEN Turnus had assembled all his pow&#8217;rs, <br />
His standard planted on Laurentum&#8217;s tow&#8217;rs; <br />
When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, <br />
Had giv&#8217;n the signal of approaching war, <br />
Had rous&#8217;d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, <br />
While the fierce riders clatter&#8217;d on their shields; <br />
Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare <br />
To join th&#8217; allies, and headlong rush to war. <br />
Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, <br />
With bold Mezentius, who blasphem&#8217;d aloud. <br />
These thro&#8217; the country took their wasteful course, <br />
The fields to forage, and to gather force. <br />
Then Venulus to Diomede they send, <br />
To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, <br />
Declare the common danger, and inform <br />
The Grecian leader of the growing storm: <br />
AEneas, landed on the Latian coast, <br />
With banish&#8217;d gods, and with a baffled host, <br />
Yet now aspir&#8217;d to conquest of the state, <br />
And claim&#8217;d a title from the gods and fate; <br />
What num&#8217;rous nations in his quarrel came, <br />
And how they spread his formidable name. <br />
What he design&#8217;d, what mischief might arise, <br />
If fortune favor&#8217;d his first enterprise, <br />
Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, <br />
And common interest, was involv&#8217;d in theirs. <br />
While Turnus and th&#8217; allies thus urge the war, <br />
The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, <br />
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare. <br />
This way and that he turns his anxious mind; <br />
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design&#8217;d; <br />
Explores himself in vain, in ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
And gives no rest to his distracted heart. <br />
So, when the sun by day, or moon by night, <br />
Strike on the polish&#8217;d brass their trembling light, <br />
The glitt&#8217;ring species here and there divide, <br />
And cast their dubious beams from side to side; <br />
Now on the walls, now on the pavement play, <br />
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day. <br />
&#8216;T was night; and weary nature lull&#8217;d asleep <br />
The birds of air, and fishes of the deep, <br />
And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief <br />
Was laid on Tiber&#8217;s banks, oppress&#8217;d with grief, <br />
And found in silent slumber late relief. <br />
Then, thro&#8217; the shadows of the poplar wood, <br />
Arose the father of the Roman flood; <br />
An azure robe was o&#8217;er his body spread, <br />
A wreath of shady reeds adorn&#8217;d his head: <br />
Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear&#8217;d, <br />
And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;Undoubted offspring of ethereal race, <br />
O long expected in this promis&#8217;d place! <br />
Who thro&#8217; the foes hast borne thy banish&#8217;d gods, <br />
Restor&#8217;d them to their hearths, and old abodes; <br />
This is thy happy home, the clime where fate <br />
Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state. <br />
Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace, <br />
And all the rage of haughty Juno cease. <br />
And that this nightly vision may not seem <br />
Th&#8217; effect of fancy, or an idle dream, <br />
A sow beneath an oak shall lie along, <br />
All white herself, and white her thirty young. <br />
When thirty rolling years have run their race, <br />
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, <br />
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, <br />
Which from this omen shall receive the name. <br />
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains, <br />
And how with sure success to crown thy pains, <br />
With patience next attend. A banish&#8217;d band, <br />
Driv&#8217;n with Evander from th&#8217; Arcadian land, <br />
Have planted here, and plac&#8217;d on high their walls; <br />
Their town the founder Pallanteum calls, <br />
Deriv&#8217;d from Pallas, his great-grandsire&#8217;s name: <br />
But the fierce Latians old possession claim, <br />
With war infesting the new colony. <br />
These make thy friends, and on their aid rely. <br />
To thy free passage I submit my streams. <br />
Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams; <br />
And, when the setting stars are lost in day, <br />
To Juno&#8217;s pow&#8217;r thy just devotion pay; <br />
With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease: <br />
Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. <br />
When thou return&#8217;st victorious from the war, <br />
Perform thy vows to me with grateful care. <br />
The god am I, whose yellow water flows <br />
Around these fields, and fattens as it goes: <br />
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods <br />
Renown&#8217;d on earth, esteem&#8217;d among the gods. <br />
This is my certain seat. In times to come, <br />
My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.&#8221; <br />
He said, and plung&#8217;d below. While yet he spoke, <br />
His dream AEneas and his sleep forsook. <br />
He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies <br />
With purple blushing, and the day arise. <br />
Then water in his hollow palm he took <br />
From Tiber&#8217;s flood, and thus the pow&#8217;rs bespoke: <br />
&#8220;Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, <br />
And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed <br />
Receive AEneas, and from danger keep. <br />
Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, <br />
Conceals thy wat&#8217;ry stores; where&#8217;er they rise, <br />
And, bubbling from below, salute the skies; <br />
Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn <br />
Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, <br />
For this thy kind compassion of our woes, <br />
Shalt share my morning song and ev&#8217;ning vows. <br />
But, O be present to thy people&#8217;s aid, <br />
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, two galleys from his stores, <br />
With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. <br />
Now on the shore the fatal swine is found. <br />
Wondrous to tell!&#8211;She lay along the ground: <br />
Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; <br />
She white herself, and white her thirty young. <br />
AEneas takes the mother and her brood, <br />
And all on Juno&#8217;s altar are bestow&#8217;d. <br />
The foll&#8217;wing night, and the succeeding day, <br />
Propitious Tiber smooth&#8217;d his wat&#8217;ry way: <br />
He roll&#8217;d his river back, and pois&#8217;d he stood, <br />
A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. <br />
The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, <br />
Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. <br />
Shouts from the land give omen to their course, <br />
And the pitch&#8217;d vessels glide with easy force. <br />
The woods and waters wonder at the gleam <br />
Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. <br />
One summer&#8217;s night and one whole day they pass <br />
Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. <br />
The fiery sun had finish&#8217;d half his race, <br />
Look&#8217;d back, and doubted in the middle space, <br />
When they from far beheld the rising tow&#8217;rs, <br />
The tops of sheds, and shepherds&#8217; lowly bow&#8217;rs, <br />
Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, <br />
Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway. <br />
These cots (Evander&#8217;s kingdom, mean and poor) <br />
The Trojan saw, and turn&#8217;d his ships to shore. <br />
&#8216;T was on a solemn day: th&#8217; Arcadian states, <br />
The king and prince, without the city gates, <br />
Then paid their off&#8217;rings in a sacred grove <br />
To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. <br />
Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies, <br />
And fat of entrails on his altar fries. <br />
But, when they saw the ships that stemm&#8217;d the flood, <br />
And glitter&#8217;d thro&#8217; the covert of the wood, <br />
They rose with fear, and left th&#8217; unfinish&#8217;d feast, <br />
Till dauntless Pallas reassur&#8217;d the rest <br />
To pay the rites. Himself without delay <br />
A jav&#8217;lin seiz&#8217;d, and singly took his way; <br />
Then gain&#8217;d a rising ground, and call&#8217;d from far: <br />
&#8220;Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; <br />
Your bus&#8217;ness here; and bring you peace or war?&#8221; <br />
High on the stern AEneas took his stand, <br />
And held a branch of olive in his hand, <br />
While thus he spoke: &#8220;The Phrygians&#8217; arms you see, <br />
Expell&#8217;d from Troy, provok&#8217;d in Italy <br />
By Latian foes, with war unjustly made; <br />
At first affianc&#8217;d, and at last betray&#8217;d. <br />
This message bear: &#8216;The Trojans and their chief <br />
Bring holy peace, and beg the king&#8217;s relief.&#8217;&#8221; <br />
Struck with so great a name, and all on fire, <br />
The youth replies: &#8220;Whatever you require, <br />
Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend, <br />
A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, downward hasting to the strand, <br />
Embrac&#8217;d the stranger prince, and join&#8217;d his hand. <br />
Conducted to the grove, AEneas broke <br />
The silence first, and thus the king bespoke: <br />
&#8220;Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate&#8217;s command, <br />
I bear these peaceful branches in my hand, <br />
Undaunted I approach you, tho&#8217; I know <br />
Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe; <br />
From Atreus tho&#8217; your ancient lineage came, <br />
And both the brother kings your kindred claim; <br />
Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, <br />
Your virtue, thro&#8217; the neighb&#8217;ring nations blown, <br />
Our fathers&#8217; mingled blood, Apollo&#8217;s voice, <br />
Have led me hither, less by need than choice. <br />
Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung, <br />
And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung: <br />
Electra from the loins of Atlas came; <br />
Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame. <br />
Your sire is Mercury, whom long before <br />
On cold Cyllene&#8217;s top fair Maia bore. <br />
Maia the fair, on fame if we rely, <br />
Was Atlas&#8217; daughter, who sustains the sky. <br />
Thus from one common source our streams divide; <br />
Ours is the Trojan, yours th&#8217; Arcadian side. <br />
Rais&#8217;d by these hopes, I sent no news before, <br />
Nor ask&#8217;d your leave, nor did your faith implore; <br />
But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador. <br />
The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue <br />
The Trojan race, are equal foes to you. <br />
Our host expell&#8217;d, what farther force can stay <br />
The victor troops from universal sway? <br />
Then will they stretch their pow&#8217;r athwart the land, <br />
And either sea from side to side command. <br />
Receive our offer&#8217;d faith, and give us thine; <br />
Ours is a gen&#8217;rous and experienc&#8217;d line: <br />
We want not hearts nor bodies for the war; <br />
In council cautious, and in fields we dare.&#8221; <br />
He said; and while he spoke, with piercing eyes <br />
Evander view&#8217;d the man with vast surprise, <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with his action, ravish&#8217;d with his face: <br />
Then answer&#8217;d briefly, with a royal grace: <br />
&#8220;O valiant leader of the Trojan line, <br />
In whom the features of thy father shine, <br />
How I recall Anchises! how I see <br />
His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! <br />
Long tho&#8217; it be, &#8216;t is fresh within my mind, <br />
When Priam to his sister&#8217;s court design&#8217;d <br />
A welcome visit, with a friendly stay, <br />
And thro&#8217; th&#8217; Arcadian kingdom took his way. <br />
Then, past a boy, the callow down began <br />
To shade my chin, and call me first a man. <br />
I saw the shining train with vast delight, <br />
And Priam&#8217;s goodly person pleas&#8217;d my sight: <br />
But great Anchises, far above the rest, <br />
With awful wonder fir&#8217;d my youthful breast. <br />
I long&#8217;d to join in friendship&#8217;s holy bands <br />
Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands. <br />
I first accosted him: I sued, I sought, <br />
And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought. <br />
He gave me, when at length constrain&#8217;d to go, <br />
A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, <br />
A vest embroider&#8217;d, glorious to behold, <br />
And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, <br />
Which my son&#8217;s coursers in obedience hold. <br />
The league you ask, I offer, as your right; <br />
And, when to-morrow&#8217;s sun reveals the light, <br />
With swift supplies you shall be sent away. <br />
Now celebrate with us this solemn day, <br />
Whose holy rites admit no long delay. <br />
Honor our annual feast; and take your seat, <br />
With friendly welcome, at a homely treat.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, the bowls (remov&#8217;d for fear) <br />
The youths replac&#8217;d, and soon restor&#8217;d the cheer. <br />
On sods of turf he set the soldiers round: <br />
A maple throne, rais&#8217;d higher from the ground, <br />
Receiv&#8217;d the Trojan chief; and, o&#8217;er the bed, <br />
A lion&#8217;s shaggy hide for ornament they spread. <br />
The loaves were serv&#8217;d in canisters; the wine <br />
In bowls; the priest renew&#8217;d the rites divine: <br />
Broil&#8217;d entrails are their food, and beef&#8217;s continued chine. <br />
But when the rage of hunger was repress&#8217;d, <br />
Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest: <br />
&#8220;These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king, <br />
From no vain fears or superstition spring, <br />
Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance, <br />
Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance; <br />
But, sav&#8217;d from danger, with a grateful sense, <br />
The labors of a god we recompense. <br />
See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky, <br />
About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie; <br />
Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare, <br />
How desart now it stands, expos&#8217;d in air! <br />
&#8216;T was once a robber&#8217;s den, inclos&#8217;d around <br />
With living stone, and deep beneath the ground. <br />
The monster Cacus, more than half a beast, <br />
This hold, impervious to the sun, possess&#8217;d. <br />
The pavement ever foul with human gore; <br />
Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door. <br />
Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire, <br />
Black clouds he belch&#8217;d, and flakes of livid fire. <br />
Time, long expected, eas&#8217;d us of our load, <br />
And brought the needful presence of a god. <br />
Th&#8217; avenging force of Hercules, from Spain, <br />
Arriv&#8217;d in triumph, from Geryon slain: <br />
Thrice liv&#8217;d the giant, and thrice liv&#8217;d in vain. <br />
His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove <br />
Near Tiber&#8217;s bank, to graze the shady grove. <br />
Allur&#8217;d with hope of plunder, and intent <br />
By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent, <br />
The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray&#8217;d, <br />
Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey&#8217;d; <br />
And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, <br />
He dragg&#8217;d &#8216;em backwards to his rocky den. <br />
The tracks averse a lying notice gave, <br />
And led the searcher backward from the cave. <br />
&#8220;Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place, <br />
To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. <br />
The beasts, who miss&#8217;d their mates, fill&#8217;d all around <br />
With bellowings, and the rocks restor&#8217;d the sound. <br />
One heifer, who had heard her love complain, <br />
Roar&#8217;d from the cave, and made the project vain. <br />
Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, <br />
And toss&#8217;d about his head his knotted oak. <br />
Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows&#8217; flight, <br />
He clomb, with eager haste, th&#8217; aerial height. <br />
Then first we saw the monster mend his pace; <br />
Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face, <br />
Confess&#8217;d the god&#8217;s approach. Trembling he springs, <br />
As terror had increas&#8217;d his feet with wings; <br />
Nor stay&#8217;d for stairs; but down the depth he threw <br />
His body, on his back the door he drew <br />
(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains <br />
His father hew&#8217;d it out, and bound with iron chains): <br />
He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos&#8217;d, <br />
And bars and levers to his foe oppos&#8217;d. <br />
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; <br />
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste; <br />
Survey&#8217;d the mouth of the forbidden hold, <br />
And here and there his raging eyes he roll&#8217;d. <br />
He gnash&#8217;d his teeth; and thrice he compass&#8217;d round <br />
With winged speed the circuit of the ground. <br />
Thrice at the cavern&#8217;s mouth he pull&#8217;d in vain, <br />
And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain. <br />
A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, <br />
Grew gibbous from behind the mountain&#8217;s back; <br />
Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, <br />
Here built their nests, and hither wing&#8217;d their flight. <br />
The leaning head hung threat&#8217;ning o&#8217;er the flood, <br />
And nodded to the left. The hero stood <br />
Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right, <br />
Tugg&#8217;d at the solid stone with all his might. <br />
Thus heav&#8217;d, the fix&#8217;d foundations of the rock <br />
Gave way; heav&#8217;n echo&#8217;d at the rattling shock. <br />
Tumbling, it chok&#8217;d the flood: on either side <br />
The banks leap backward, and the streams divide; <br />
The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread, <br />
And trembling Tiber div&#8217;d beneath his bed. <br />
The court of Cacus stands reveal&#8217;d to sight; <br />
The cavern glares with new-admitted light. <br />
So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound, <br />
Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground; <br />
A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high, <br />
The gods with hate beheld the nether sky: <br />
The ghosts repine at violated night, <br />
And curse th&#8217; invading sun, and sicken at the sight. <br />
The graceless monster, caught in open day, <br />
Inclos&#8217;d, and in despair to fly away, <br />
Howls horrible from underneath, and fills <br />
His hollow palace with unmanly yells. <br />
The hero stands above, and from afar <br />
Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war. <br />
He, from his nostrils and huge mouth, expires <br />
Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father&#8217;s fires, <br />
Gath&#8217;ring, with each repeated blast, the night, <br />
To make uncertain aim, and erring sight. <br />
The wrathful god then plunges from above, <br />
And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove, <br />
There lights; and wades thro&#8217; fumes, and gropes his way, <br />
Half sing&#8217;d, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. <br />
The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found; <br />
He squeez&#8217;d his throat; he writh&#8217;d his neck around, <br />
And in a knot his crippled members bound; <br />
Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes: <br />
Roll&#8217;d on a heap, the breathless robber lies. <br />
The doors, unbarr&#8217;d, receive the rushing day, <br />
And thoro&#8217; lights disclose the ravish&#8217;d prey. <br />
The bulls, redeem&#8217;d, breathe open air again. <br />
Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den. <br />
The wond&#8217;ring neighborhood, with glad surprise, <br />
Behold his shagged breast, his giant size, <br />
His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish&#8217;d eyes. <br />
From that auspicious day, with rites divine, <br />
We worship at the hero&#8217;s holy shrine. <br />
Potitius first ordain&#8217;d these annual vows: <br />
As priests, were added the Pinarian house, <br />
Who rais&#8217;d this altar in the sacred shade, <br />
Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid. <br />
For these deserts, and this high virtue shown, <br />
Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown: <br />
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, <br />
And with deep draughts invoke our common god.&#8221; <br />
This said, a double wreath Evander twin&#8217;d, <br />
And poplars black and white his temples bind. <br />
Then brims his ample bowl. With like design <br />
The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. <br />
Meantime the sun descended from the skies, <br />
And the bright evening star began to rise. <br />
And now the priests, Potitius at their head, <br />
In skins of beasts involv&#8217;d, the long procession led; <br />
Held high the flaming tapers in their hands, <br />
As custom had prescrib&#8217;d their holy bands; <br />
Then with a second course the tables load, <br />
And with full chargers offer to the god. <br />
The Salii sing, and cense his altars round <br />
With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound&#8211; <br />
One choir of old, another of the young, <br />
To dance, and bear the burthen of the song. <br />
The lay records the labors, and the praise, <br />
And all th&#8217; immortal acts of Hercules: <br />
First, how the mighty babe, when swath&#8217;d in bands, <br />
The serpents strangled with his infant hands; <br />
Then, as in years and matchless force he grew, <br />
Th&#8217; OEchalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew. <br />
Besides, a thousand hazards they relate, <br />
Procur&#8217;d by Juno&#8217;s and Eurystheus&#8217; hate: <br />
&#8220;Thy hands, unconquer&#8217;d hero, could subdue <br />
The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew: <br />
Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood, <br />
Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood. <br />
The triple porter of the Stygian seat, <br />
With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet, <br />
And, seiz&#8217;d with fear, forgot his mangled meat. <br />
Th&#8217; infernal waters trembled at thy sight; <br />
Thee, god, no face of danger could affright; <br />
Not huge Typhoeus, nor th&#8217; unnumber&#8217;d snake, <br />
Increas&#8217;d with hissing heads, in Lerna&#8217;s lake. <br />
Hail, Jove&#8217;s undoubted son! an added grace <br />
To heav&#8217;n and the great author of thy race! <br />
Receive the grateful off&#8217;rings which we pay, <br />
And smile propitious on thy solemn day!&#8221; <br />
In numbers thus they sung; above the rest, <br />
The den and death of Cacus crown the feast. <br />
The woods to hollow vales convey the sound, <br />
The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. <br />
The rites perform&#8217;d, the cheerful train retire. <br />
Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire, <br />
The Trojan pass&#8217;d, the city to survey, <br />
And pleasing talk beguil&#8217;d the tedious way. <br />
The stranger cast around his curious eyes, <br />
New objects viewing still, with new surprise; <br />
With greedy joy enquires of various things, <br />
And acts and monuments of ancient kings. <br />
Then thus the founder of the Roman tow&#8217;rs: <br />
&#8220;These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow&#8217;rs, <br />
Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took <br />
Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. <br />
Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care <br />
Of lab&#8217;ring oxen, or the shining share, <br />
Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain&#8217;d to spare. <br />
Their exercise the chase; the running flood <br />
Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food. <br />
Then Saturn came, who fled the pow&#8217;r of Jove, <br />
Robb&#8217;d of his realms, and banish&#8217;d from above. <br />
The men, dispers&#8217;d on hills, to towns he brought, <br />
And laws ordain&#8217;d, and civil customs taught, <br />
And Latium call&#8217;d the land where safe he lay <br />
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway. <br />
With his mild empire, peace and plenty came; <br />
And hence the golden times deriv&#8217;d their name. <br />
A more degenerate and discolor&#8217;d age <br />
Succeeded this, with avarice and rage. <br />
Th&#8217; Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came; <br />
And Saturn&#8217;s empire often chang&#8217;d the name. <br />
Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest, <br />
With arbitrary sway the land oppress&#8217;d: <br />
For Tiber&#8217;s flood was Albula before, <br />
Till, from the tyrant&#8217;s fate, his name it bore. <br />
I last arriv&#8217;d, driv&#8217;n from my native home <br />
By fortune&#8217;s pow&#8217;r, and fate&#8217;s resistless doom. <br />
Long toss&#8217;d on seas, I sought this happy land, <br />
Warn&#8217;d by my mother nymph, and call&#8217;d by Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s command.&#8221; <br />
Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew&#8217;d the gate, <br />
Since call&#8217;d Carmental by the Roman state; <br />
Where stood an altar, sacred to the name <br />
Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame, <br />
Who to her son foretold th&#8217; AEnean race, <br />
Sublime in fame, and Rome&#8217;s imperial place: <br />
Then shews the forest, which, in after times, <br />
Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes <br />
A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine <br />
Where Pan below the rock had rites divine: <br />
Then tells of Argus&#8217; death, his murder&#8217;d guest, <br />
Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest. <br />
Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads; <br />
Now roof&#8217;d with gold, then thatch&#8217;d with homely reeds. <br />
A reverent fear (such superstition reigns <br />
Among the rude) ev&#8217;n then possess&#8217;d the swains. <br />
Some god, they knew&#8211;what god, they could not tell&#8211; <br />
Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell. <br />
Th&#8217; Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw <br />
The mighty Thund&#8217;rer with majestic awe, <br />
Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around, <br />
And scatter&#8217;d tempests on the teeming ground. <br />
Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood <br />
Two stately towns, on either side the flood,) <br />
Saturnia&#8217;s and Janicula&#8217;s remains; <br />
And either place the founder&#8217;s name retains. <br />
Discoursing thus together, they resort <br />
Where poor Evander kept his country court. <br />
They view&#8217;d the ground of Rome&#8217;s litigious hall; <br />
(Once oxen low&#8217;d, where now the lawyers bawl;) <br />
Then, stooping, thro&#8217; the narrow gate they press&#8217;d, <br />
When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: <br />
&#8220;Mean as it is, this palace, and this door, <br />
Receiv&#8217;d Alcides, then a conqueror. <br />
Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, <br />
Which feasted him, and emulate a god.&#8221; <br />
Then underneath a lowly roof he led <br />
The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; <br />
The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o&#8217;erspread. <br />
Now Night had shed her silver dews around, <br />
And with her sable wings embrac&#8217;d the ground, <br />
When love&#8217;s fair goddess, anxious for her son, <br />
(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,) <br />
Couch&#8217;d with her husband in his golden bed, <br />
With these alluring words invokes his aid; <br />
And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move, <br />
Inspires each accent with the charms of love: <br />
&#8220;While cruel fate conspir&#8217;d with Grecian pow&#8217;rs, <br />
To level with the ground the Trojan tow&#8217;rs, <br />
I ask&#8217;d not aid th&#8217; unhappy to restore, <br />
Nor did the succor of thy skill implore; <br />
Nor urg&#8217;d the labors of my lord in vain, <br />
A sinking empire longer to sustain, <br />
Tho&#8217; much I ow&#8217;d to Priam&#8217;s house, and more <br />
The dangers of AEneas did deplore. <br />
But now, by Jove&#8217;s command, and fate&#8217;s decree, <br />
His race is doom&#8217;d to reign in Italy: <br />
With humble suit I beg thy needful art, <br />
O still propitious pow&#8217;r, that rules my heart! <br />
A mother kneels a suppliant for her son. <br />
By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won <br />
To forge impenetrable shields, and grace <br />
With fated arms a less illustrious race. <br />
Behold, what haughty nations are combin&#8217;d <br />
Against the relics of the Phrygian kind, <br />
With fire and sword my people to destroy, <br />
And conquer Venus twice, in conqu&#8217;ring Troy.&#8221; <br />
She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue, <br />
About her unresolving husband threw. <br />
Her soft embraces soon infuse desire; <br />
His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; <br />
And all the godhead feels the wonted fire. <br />
Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies, <br />
Or forky lightnings flash along the skies. <br />
The goddess, proud of her successful wiles, <br />
And conscious of her form, in secret smiles. <br />
Then thus the pow&#8217;r, obnoxious to her charms, <br />
Panting, and half dissolving in her arms: <br />
&#8220;Why seek you reasons for a cause so just, <br />
Or your own beauties or my love distrust? <br />
Long since, had you requir&#8217;d my helpful hand, <br />
Th&#8217; artificer and art you might command, <br />
To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate, <br />
Confin&#8217;d their empire to so short a date. <br />
And, if you now desire new wars to wage, <br />
My skill I promise, and my pains engage. <br />
Whatever melting metals can conspire, <br />
Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire, <br />
Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove, <br />
And think no task is difficult to love.&#8221; <br />
Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms, <br />
He snatch&#8217;d the willing goddess to his arms; <br />
Till in her lap infus&#8217;d, he lay possess&#8217;d <br />
Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest. <br />
Now when the Night her middle race had rode, <br />
And his first slumber had refresh&#8217;d the god&#8211; <br />
The time when early housewives leave the bed; <br />
When living embers on the hearth they spread, <br />
Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise&#8211; <br />
With yawning mouths, and with half-open&#8217;d eyes, <br />
They ply the distaff by the winking light, <br />
And to their daily labor add the night: <br />
Thus frugally they earn their children&#8217;s bread, <br />
And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed&#8211; <br />
Not less concern&#8217;d, nor at a later hour, <br />
Rose from his downy couch the forging pow&#8217;r. <br />
Sacred to Vulcan&#8217;s name, an isle there lay, <br />
Betwixt Sicilia&#8217;s coasts and Lipare, <br />
Rais&#8217;d high on smoking rocks; and, deep below, <br />
In hollow caves the fires of AEtna glow. <br />
The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; <br />
Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, <br />
Are heard around; the boiling waters roar, <br />
And smoky flames thro&#8217; fuming tunnels soar. <br />
Hether the Father of the Fire, by night, <br />
Thro&#8217; the brown air precipitates his flight. <br />
On their eternal anvils here he found <br />
The brethren beating, and the blows go round. <br />
A load of pointless thunder now there lies <br />
Before their hands, to ripen for the skies: <br />
These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast; <br />
Consum&#8217;d on mortals with prodigious waste. <br />
Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more, <br />
Of winged southern winds and cloudy store <br />
As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; <br />
And fears are added, and avenging flame. <br />
Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair <br />
His broken axletrees and blunted war, <br />
And send him forth again with furbish&#8217;d arms, <br />
To wake the lazy war with trumpets&#8217; loud alarms. <br />
The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold <br />
The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold. <br />
Full on the crest the Gorgon&#8217;s head they place, <br />
With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face. <br />
&#8220;My sons,&#8221; said Vulcan, &#8220;set your tasks aside; <br />
Your strength and master-skill must now be tried. <br />
Arms for a hero forge; arms that require <br />
Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.&#8221; <br />
He said. They set their former work aside, <br />
And their new toils with eager haste divide. <br />
A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, <br />
And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll&#8217;d; <br />
Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare, <br />
Alone sufficient to sustain the war. <br />
Sev&#8217;n orbs within a spacious round they close: <br />
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows. <br />
The hissing steel is in the smithy drown&#8217;d; <br />
The grot with beaten anvils groans around. <br />
By turns their arms advance, in equal time; <br />
By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime. <br />
They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; <br />
The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs. <br />
While, at the Lemnian god&#8217;s command, they urge <br />
Their labors thus, and ply th&#8217; AEolian forge, <br />
The cheerful morn salutes Evander&#8217;s eyes, <br />
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise. <br />
He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet <br />
Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet: <br />
He sets his trusty sword upon his side, <br />
And o&#8217;er his shoulder throws a panther&#8217;s hide. <br />
Two menial dogs before their master press&#8217;d. <br />
Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest. <br />
Mindful of promis&#8217;d aid, he mends his pace, <br />
But meets AEneas in the middle space. <br />
Young Pallas did his father&#8217;s steps attend, <br />
And true Achates waited on his friend. <br />
They join their hands; a secret seat they choose; <br />
Th&#8217; Arcadian first their former talk renews: <br />
&#8220;Undaunted prince, I never can believe <br />
The Trojan empire lost, while you survive. <br />
Command th&#8217; assistance of a faithful friend; <br />
But feeble are the succors I can send. <br />
Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds; <br />
That other side the Latian state surrounds, <br />
Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. <br />
But mighty nations I prepare, to join <br />
Their arms with yours, and aid your just design. <br />
You come, as by your better genius sent, <br />
And fortune seems to favor your intent. <br />
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town, <br />
Of ancient building, and of high renown, <br />
Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race, <br />
Who gave the name of Caere to the place, <br />
Once Agyllina call&#8217;d. It flourish&#8217;d long, <br />
In pride of wealth and warlike people strong, <br />
Till curs&#8217;d Mezentius, in a fatal hour, <br />
Assum&#8217;d the crown, with arbitrary pow&#8217;r. <br />
What words can paint those execrable times, <br />
The subjects&#8217; suff&#8217;rings, and the tyrant&#8217;s crimes! <br />
That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace <br />
On his own head, and on his impious race! <br />
The living and the dead at his command <br />
Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand, <br />
Till, chok&#8217;d with stench, in loath&#8217;d embraces tied, <br />
The ling&#8217;ring wretches pin&#8217;d away and died. <br />
Thus plung&#8217;d in ills, and meditating more&#8211; <br />
The people&#8217;s patience, tir&#8217;d, no longer bore <br />
The raging monster; but with arms beset <br />
His house, and vengeance and destruction threat. <br />
They fire his palace: while the flame ascends, <br />
They force his guards, and execute his friends. <br />
He cleaves the crowd, and, favor&#8217;d by the night, <br />
To Turnus&#8217; friendly court directs his flight. <br />
By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire, <br />
With arms, their king to punishment require: <br />
Their num&#8217;rous troops, now muster&#8217;d on the strand, <br />
My counsel shall submit to your command. <br />
Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry <br />
To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. <br />
An ancient augur, skill&#8217;d in future fate, <br />
With these foreboding words restrains their hate: <br />
&#8216;Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow&#8217;r <br />
Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow&#8217;r, <br />
Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms, <br />
To seek your tyrant&#8217;s death by lawful arms; <br />
Know this: no native of our land may lead <br />
This pow&#8217;rful people; seek a foreign head.&#8217; <br />
Aw&#8217;d with these words, in camps they still abide, <br />
And wait with longing looks their promis&#8217;d guide. <br />
Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent <br />
Their crown, and ev&#8217;ry regal ornament: <br />
The people join their own with his desire; <br />
And all my conduct, as their king, require. <br />
But the chill blood that creeps within my veins, <br />
And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains, <br />
And a soul conscious of its own decay, <br />
Have forc&#8217;d me to refuse imperial sway. <br />
My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, <br />
And should, but he&#8217;s a Sabine mother&#8217;s son, <br />
And half a native; but, in you, combine <br />
A manly vigor, and a foreign line. <br />
Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way, <br />
Pursue the ready path to sov&#8217;reign sway. <br />
The staff of my declining days, my son, <br />
Shall make your good or ill success his own; <br />
In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, <br />
And serve the hard apprenticeship of war; <br />
Your matchless courage and your conduct view, <br />
And early shall begin t&#8217; admire and copy you. <br />
Besides, two hundred horse he shall command; <br />
Tho&#8217; few, a warlike and well-chosen band. <br />
These in my name are listed; and my son <br />
As many more has added in his own.&#8221; <br />
Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, <br />
With downcast eyes, their silent grief express&#8217;d; <br />
Who, short of succors, and in deep despair, <br />
Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. <br />
But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, <br />
To cheer her issue, thunder&#8217;d thrice aloud; <br />
Thrice forky lightning flash&#8217;d along the sky, <br />
And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. <br />
Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; <br />
And, in a heav&#8217;n serene, refulgent arms appear: <br />
Redd&#8217;ning the skies, and glitt&#8217;ring all around, <br />
The temper&#8217;d metals clash, and yield a silver sound. <br />
The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; <br />
AEneas only, conscious to the sign, <br />
Presag&#8217;d th&#8217; event, and joyful view&#8217;d, above, <br />
Th&#8217; accomplish&#8217;d promise of the Queen of Love. <br />
Then, to th&#8217; Arcadian king: &#8220;This prodigy <br />
(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. <br />
Heav&#8217;n calls me to the war: th&#8217; expected sign <br />
Is giv&#8217;n of promis&#8217;d aid, and arms divine. <br />
My goddess mother, whose indulgent care <br />
Foresaw the dangers of the growing war, <br />
This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms, <br />
Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms, <br />
Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow&#8217;d <br />
Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood. <br />
Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn; <br />
And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne, <br />
Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms; <br />
And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur&#8217;d arms.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, rising from his homely throne, <br />
The solemn rites of Hercules begun, <br />
And on his altars wak&#8217;d the sleeping fires; <br />
Then cheerful to his household gods retires; <br />
There offers chosen sheep. Th&#8217; Arcadian king <br />
And Trojan youth the same oblations bring. <br />
Next, of his men and ships he makes review; <br />
Draws out the best and ablest of the crew. <br />
Down with the falling stream the refuse run, <br />
To raise with joyful news his drooping son. <br />
Steeds are prepar&#8217;d to mount the Trojan band, <br />
Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. <br />
A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest, <br />
The king himself presents his royal guest: <br />
A lion&#8217;s hide his back and limbs infold, <br />
Precious with studded work, and paws of gold. <br />
Fame thro&#8217; the little city spreads aloud <br />
Th&#8217; intended march, amid the fearful crowd: <br />
The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, <br />
And double their devotion in their fears. <br />
The war at hand appears with more affright, <br />
And rises ev&#8217;ry moment to the sight. <br />
Then old Evander, with a close embrace, <br />
Strain&#8217;d his departing friend; and tears o&#8217;erflow his face. <br />
&#8220;Would Heav&#8217;n,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my strength and youth recall, <br />
Such as I was beneath Praeneste&#8217;s wall; <br />
Then when I made the foremost foes retire, <br />
And set whole heaps of conquer&#8217;d shields on fire; <br />
When Herilus in single fight I slew, <br />
Whom with three lives Feronia did endue; <br />
And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore, <br />
Till the last ebbing soul return&#8217;d no more&#8211; <br />
Such if I stood renew&#8217;d, not these alarms, <br />
Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas&#8217; arms; <br />
Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish&#8217;d, boast <br />
His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast. <br />
Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring <br />
Relief, and hear a father and a king! <br />
If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see <br />
My son return with peace and victory; <br />
If the lov&#8217;d boy shall bless his father&#8217;s sight; <br />
If we shall meet again with more delight; <br />
Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, <br />
In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. <br />
But if your hard decrees&#8211;which, O! I dread&#8211; <br />
Have doom&#8217;d to death his undeserving head; <br />
This, O this very moment, let me die! <br />
While hopes and fears in equal balance lie; <br />
While, yet possess&#8217;d of all his youthful charms, <br />
I strain him close within these aged arms; <br />
Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!&#8221; <br />
He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground. <br />
His servants bore him off, and softly laid <br />
His languish&#8217;d limbs upon his homely bed. <br />
The horsemen march; the gates are open&#8217;d wide; <br />
AEneas at their head, Achates by his side. <br />
Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along; <br />
Last follows in the rear th&#8217; Arcadian throng. <br />
Young Pallas shone conspicuous o&#8217;er the rest; <br />
Gilded his arms, embroider&#8217;d was his vest. <br />
So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head <br />
The star by whom the lights of heav&#8217;n are led; <br />
Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, <br />
Dispels the darkness, and the day renews. <br />
The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, <br />
And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, <br />
Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far <br />
The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. <br />
The troops, drawn up in beautiful array, <br />
O&#8217;er heathy plains pursue the ready way. <br />
Repeated peals of shouts are heard around; <br />
The neighing coursers answer to the sound, <br />
And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. <br />
A greenwood shade, for long religion known, <br />
Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, <br />
Incompass&#8217;d round with gloomy hills above, <br />
Which add a holy horror to the grove. <br />
The first inhabitants of Grecian blood, <br />
That sacred forest to Silvanus vow&#8217;d, <br />
The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay <br />
Their due devotions on his annual day. <br />
Not far from hence, along the river&#8217;s side, <br />
In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, <br />
By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, <br />
AEneas cast his wond&#8217;ring eyes around, <br />
And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on the spacious plain from left to right. <br />
Thether his warlike train the Trojan led, <br />
Refresh&#8217;d his men, and wearied horses fed. <br />
Meantime the mother goddess, crown&#8217;d with charms, <br />
Breaks thro&#8217; the clouds, and brings the fated arms. <br />
Within a winding vale she finds her son, <br />
On the cool river&#8217;s banks, retir&#8217;d alone. <br />
She shews her heav&#8217;nly form without disguise, <br />
And gives herself to his desiring eyes. <br />
&#8220;Behold,&#8221; she said, &#8220;perform&#8217;d in ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
My promise made, and Vulcan&#8217;s labor&#8217;d art. <br />
Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, <br />
And haughty Turnus to the field defy.&#8221; <br />
She said; and, having first her son embrac&#8217;d, <br />
The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac&#8217;d, <br />
Proud of the gift, he roll&#8217;d his greedy sight <br />
Around the work, and gaz&#8217;d with vast delight. <br />
He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires <br />
The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: <br />
His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, <br />
One keen with temper&#8217;d steel, one stiff with gold: <br />
Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; <br />
So shines a cloud, when edg&#8217;d with adverse light. <br />
He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try <br />
The plated cuishes on his manly thigh; <br />
But most admires the shield&#8217;s mysterious mold, <br />
And Roman triumphs rising on the gold: <br />
For these, emboss&#8217;d, the heav&#8217;nly smith had wrought <br />
(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) <br />
The wars in order, and the race divine <br />
Of warriors issuing from the Julian line. <br />
The cave of Mars was dress&#8217;d with mossy greens: <br />
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. <br />
Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung; <br />
The foster dam loll&#8217;d out her fawning tongue: <br />
They suck&#8217;d secure, while, bending back her head, <br />
She lick&#8217;d their tender limbs, and form&#8217;d them as they fed. <br />
Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games <br />
Projected for the rape of Sabine dames. <br />
The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds, <br />
For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds. <br />
Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend; <br />
The Romans there with arms the prey defend. <br />
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease; <br />
And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace. <br />
The friendly chiefs before Jove&#8217;s altar stand, <br />
Both arm&#8217;d, with each a charger in his hand: <br />
A fatted sow for sacrifice is led, <br />
With imprecations on the perjur&#8217;d head. <br />
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch&#8217;d between <br />
Four fiery steeds, is dragg&#8217;d along the green, <br />
By Tullus&#8217; doom: the brambles drink his blood, <br />
And his torn limbs are left the vulture&#8217;s food. <br />
There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings, <br />
And would by force restore the banish&#8217;d kings. <br />
One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights; <br />
The Roman youth assert their native rights. <br />
Before the town the Tuscan army lies, <br />
To win by famine, or by fraud surprise. <br />
Their king, half-threat&#8217;ning, half-disdaining stood, <br />
While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm&#8217;d the flood. <br />
The captive maids there tempt the raging tide, <br />
Scap&#8217;d from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide. <br />
High on a rock heroic Manlius stood, <br />
To guard the temple, and the temple&#8217;s god. <br />
Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold <br />
The palace thatch&#8217;d with straw, now roof&#8217;d with gold. <br />
The silver goose before the shining gate <br />
There flew, and, by her cackle, sav&#8217;d the state. <br />
She told the Gauls&#8217; approach; th&#8217; approaching Gauls, <br />
Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls. <br />
The gold dissembled well their yellow hair, <br />
And golden chains on their white necks they wear. <br />
Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield, <br />
And their left arm sustains a length of shield. <br />
Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance; <br />
And naked thro&#8217; the streets the mad Luperci dance, <br />
In caps of wool; the targets dropp&#8217;d from heav&#8217;n. <br />
Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv&#8217;n, <br />
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear, <br />
And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear. <br />
Far hence remov&#8217;d, the Stygian seats are seen; <br />
Pains of the damn&#8217;d, and punish&#8217;d Catiline <br />
Hung on a rock&#8211;the traitor; and, around, <br />
The Furies hissing from the nether ground. <br />
Apart from these, the happy souls he draws, <br />
And Cato&#8217;s holy ghost dispensing laws. <br />
Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; <br />
But foaming surges there in silver play. <br />
The dancing dolphins with their tails divide <br />
The glitt&#8217;ring waves, and cut the precious tide. <br />
Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage <br />
Their brazen beaks, oppos&#8217;d with equal rage. <br />
Actium surveys the well-disputed prize; <br />
Leucate&#8217;s wat&#8217;ry plain with foamy billows fries. <br />
Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright, <br />
Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight: <br />
His beamy temples shoot their flames afar, <br />
And o&#8217;er his head is hung the Julian star. <br />
Agrippa seconds him, with prosp&#8217;rous gales, <br />
And, with propitious gods, his foes assails: <br />
A naval crown, that binds his manly brows, <br />
The happy fortune of the fight foreshows. <br />
Rang&#8217;d on the line oppos&#8217;d, Antonius brings <br />
Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings; <br />
Th&#8217; Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar, <br />
Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war: <br />
And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife, <br />
His ill fate follows him&#8211;th&#8217; Egyptian wife. <br />
Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows <br />
The froth is gather&#8217;d, and the water glows. <br />
It seems, as if the Cyclades again <br />
Were rooted up, and justled in the main; <br />
Or floating mountains floating mountains meet; <br />
Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet. <br />
Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav&#8217;lins fly; <br />
The fields of Neptune take a purple dye. <br />
The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, <br />
With cymbals toss&#8217;d her fainting soldiers warms&#8211; <br />
Fool as she was! who had not yet divin&#8217;d <br />
Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind. <br />
Her country gods, the monsters of the sky, <br />
Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love&#8217;s Queen defy: <br />
The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain, <br />
Nor longer dares oppose th&#8217; ethereal train. <br />
Mars in the middle of the shining shield <br />
Is grav&#8217;d, and strides along the liquid field. <br />
The Dirae souse from heav&#8217;n with swift descent; <br />
And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent, <br />
Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads, <br />
And shakes her iron rod above their heads. <br />
This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height, <br />
Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight <br />
The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield, <br />
And soft Sabaeans quit the wat&#8217;ry field. <br />
The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails, <br />
And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales. <br />
Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath, <br />
Panting, and pale with fear of future death. <br />
The god had figur&#8217;d her as driv&#8217;n along <br />
By winds and waves, and scudding thro&#8217; the throng. <br />
Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide <br />
His arms and ample bosom to the tide, <br />
And spreads his mantle o&#8217;er the winding coast, <br />
In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. <br />
The victor to the gods his thanks express&#8217;d, <br />
And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless&#8217;d. <br />
Three hundred temples in the town he plac&#8217;d; <br />
With spoils and altars ev&#8217;ry temple grac&#8217;d. <br />
Three shining nights, and three succeeding days, <br />
The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise, <br />
The domes with songs, the theaters with plays. <br />
All altars flame: before each altar lies, <br />
Drench&#8217;d in his gore, the destin&#8217;d sacrifice. <br />
Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne, <br />
Before Apollo&#8217;s porch of Parian stone; <br />
Accepts the presents vow&#8217;d for victory, <br />
And hangs the monumental crowns on high. <br />
Vast crowds of vanquish&#8217;d nations march along, <br />
Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue. <br />
Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place <br />
For Carians, and th&#8217; ungirt Numidian race; <br />
Then ranks the Thracians in the second row, <br />
With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow. <br />
And here the tam&#8217;d Euphrates humbly glides, <br />
And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, <br />
And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; <br />
The Danes&#8217; unconquer&#8217;d offspring march behind, <br />
And Morini, the last of humankind. <br />
These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, <br />
By Vulcan labor&#8217;d, and by Venus brought, <br />
With joy and wonder fill the hero&#8217;s thought. <br />
Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, <br />
And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race.</p>
