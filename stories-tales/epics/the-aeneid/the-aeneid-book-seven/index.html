				<p>THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; King Latinus entertains AEneas, and promises<br />
him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus,<br />
being in love with her, favor&#8217;d by her mother, and stirr&#8217;d up by<br />
June and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages<br />
in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many others of<br />
the neighboring princes; whose forces, and the names of their<br />
commanders, are here particularly related.</p>
<p>AND thou, O matron of immortal fame, <br />
Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; <br />
Cajeta still the place is call&#8217;d from thee, <br />
The nurse of great AEneas&#8217; infancy. <br />
Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia&#8217;s plains; <br />
Thy name (&#8216;t is all a ghost can have) remains. <br />
Now, when the prince her fun&#8217;ral rites had paid, <br />
He plow&#8217;d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display&#8217;d. <br />
From land a gentle breeze arose by night, <br />
Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, <br />
And the sea trembled with her silver light. <br />
Now near the shelves of Circe&#8217;s shores they run, <br />
(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) <br />
A dang&#8217;rous coast: the goddess wastes her days <br />
In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: <br />
In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, <br />
And cedar brands supply her father&#8217;s light. <br />
From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main, <br />
The roars of lions that refuse the chain, <br />
The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, <br />
And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors&#8217; ears. <br />
These from their caverns, at the close of night, <br />
Fill the sad isle with horror and affright. <br />
Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe&#8217;s pow&#8217;r, <br />
(That watch&#8217;d the moon and planetary hour,) <br />
With words and wicked herbs from humankind <br />
Had alter&#8217;d, and in brutal shapes confin&#8217;d. <br />
Which monsters lest the Trojans&#8217; pious host <br />
Should bear, or touch upon th&#8217; inchanted coast, <br />
Propitious Neptune steer&#8217;d their course by night <br />
With rising gales that sped their happy flight. <br />
Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, <br />
And hear the swelling surges vainly roar. <br />
Now, when the rosy morn began to rise, <br />
And wav&#8217;d her saffron streamer thro&#8217; the skies; <br />
When Thetis blush&#8217;d in purple not her own, <br />
And from her face the breathing winds were blown, <br />
A sudden silence sate upon the sea, <br />
And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. <br />
The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, <br />
Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood: <br />
Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course, <br />
With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force, <br />
That drove the sand along, he took his way, <br />
And roll&#8217;d his yellow billows to the sea. <br />
About him, and above, and round the wood, <br />
The birds that haunt the borders of his flood, <br />
That bath&#8217;d within, or basked upon his side, <br />
To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied. <br />
The captain gives command; the joyful train <br />
Glide thro&#8217; the gloomy shade, and leave the main. <br />
Now, Erato, thy poet&#8217;s mind inspire, <br />
And fill his soul with thy celestial fire! <br />
Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; <br />
Declare the past and present state of things, <br />
When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, <br />
And how the rivals lov&#8217;d, and how they fought. <br />
These are my theme, and how the war began, <br />
And how concluded by the godlike man: <br />
For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, <br />
Which princes and their people did engage; <br />
And haughty souls, that, mov&#8217;d with mutual hate, <br />
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate; <br />
That rous&#8217;d the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, <br />
And peaceful Italy involv&#8217;d in arms. <br />
A larger scene of action is display&#8217;d; <br />
And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh&#8217;d. <br />
Latinus, old and mild, had long possess&#8217;d <br />
The Latin scepter, and his people blest: <br />
His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame <br />
His mother; fair Marica was her name. <br />
But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew <br />
His birth from Saturn, if records be true. <br />
Thus King Latinus, in the third degree, <br />
Had Saturn author of his family. <br />
But this old peaceful prince, as Heav&#8217;n decreed, <br />
Was blest with no male issue to succeed: <br />
His sons in blooming youth were snatch&#8217;d by fate; <br />
One only daughter heir&#8217;d the royal state. <br />
Fir&#8217;d with her love, and with ambition led, <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring princes court her nuptial bed. <br />
Among the crowd, but far above the rest, <br />
Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address&#8217;d. <br />
Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, <br />
Was first, and favor&#8217;d by the Latian queen; <br />
With him she strove to join Lavinia&#8217;s hand, <br />
But dire portents the purpos&#8217;d match withstand. <br />
Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood <br />
A laurel&#8217;s trunk, a venerable wood; <br />
Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair <br />
Was kept and cut with superstitious care. <br />
This plant Latinus, when his town he wall&#8217;d, <br />
Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call&#8217;d; <br />
And last, in honor of his new abode, <br />
He vow&#8217;d the laurel to the laurel&#8217;s god. <br />
It happen&#8217;d once (a boding prodigy!) <br />
A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky, <br />
(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,) <br />
Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; <br />
There with their clasping feet together clung, <br />
And a long cluster from the laurel hung. <br />
An ancient augur prophesied from hence: <br />
&#8220;Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! <br />
From the same parts of heav&#8217;n his navy stands, <br />
To the same parts on earth; his army lands; <br />
The town he conquers, and the tow&#8217;r commands.&#8221; <br />
Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire <br />
Before the gods, and stood beside her sire, <br />
(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv&#8217;d in smoke <br />
Of incense, from the sacred altar broke, <br />
Caught her dishevel&#8217;d hair and rich attire; <br />
Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire: <br />
From thence the fuming trail began to spread <br />
And lambent glories danc&#8217;d about her head. <br />
This new portent the seer with wonder views, <br />
Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews: <br />
&#8220;The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, <br />
Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown&#8217;d; <br />
But, caus&#8217;d by her irrevocable fate, <br />
War shall the country waste, and change the state.&#8217; <br />
Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, <br />
For counsel to his father Faunus went, <br />
And sought the shades renown&#8217;d for prophecy <br />
Which near Albunea&#8217;s sulph&#8217;rous fountain lie. <br />
To these the Latian and the Sabine land <br />
Fly, when distress&#8217;d, and thence relief demand. <br />
The priest on skins of off&#8217;rings takes his ease, <br />
And nightly visions in his slumber sees; <br />
A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears, <br />
And, flutt&#8217;ring round his temples, deafs his ears: <br />
These he consults, the future fates to know, <br />
From pow&#8217;rs above, and from the fiends below. <br />
Here, for the gods&#8217; advice, Latinus flies, <br />
Off&#8217;ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice: <br />
Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir&#8217;d, <br />
He laid beneath him, and to rest retir&#8217;d. <br />
No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, <br />
When, from above, a more than mortal sound <br />
Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke: <br />
&#8220;Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke <br />
Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke. <br />
A foreign son upon thy shore descends, <br />
Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends. <br />
His race, in arms and arts of peace renown&#8217;d, <br />
Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: <br />
&#8216;T is theirs whate&#8217;er the sun surveys around.&#8217; <br />
These answers, in the silent night receiv&#8217;d, <br />
The king himself divulg&#8217;d, the land believ&#8217;d: <br />
The fame thro&#8217; all the neighb&#8217;ring nations flew, <br />
When now the Trojan navy was in view. <br />
Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread <br />
His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; <br />
And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. <br />
They sate; and, (not without the god&#8217;s command,) <br />
Their homely fare dispatch&#8217;d, the hungry band <br />
Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, <br />
To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. <br />
Ascanius this observ&#8217;d, and smiling said: <br />
&#8220;See, we devour the plates on which we fed.&#8221; <br />
The speech had omen, that the Trojan race <br />
Should find repose, and this the time and place. <br />
AEneas took the word, and thus replies, <br />
Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes: <br />
&#8220;All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! <br />
Behold the destin&#8217;d place of your abodes! <br />
For thus Anchises prophesied of old, <br />
And this our fatal place of rest foretold: <br />
&#8216;When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, <br />
By famine forc&#8217;d, your trenchers you shall eat, <br />
Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, <br />
And the long labors of your voyage end. <br />
Remember on that happy coast to build, <br />
And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.&#8217; <br />
This was that famine, this the fatal place <br />
Which ends the wand&#8217;ring of our exil&#8217;d race. <br />
Then, on to-morrow&#8217;s dawn, your care employ, <br />
To search the land, and where the cities lie, <br />
And what the men; but give this day to joy. <br />
Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, <br />
Call great Anchises to the genial feast: <br />
Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; <br />
Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, the hero bound his brows <br />
With leafy branches, then perform&#8217;d his vows; <br />
Adoring first the genius of the place, <br />
Then Earth, the mother of the heav&#8217;nly race, <br />
The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, <br />
And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne, <br />
And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, <br />
And last his sire below, and mother queen above. <br />
Then heav&#8217;n&#8217;s high monarch thunder&#8217;d thrice aloud, <br />
And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. <br />
Soon thro&#8217; the joyful camp a rumor flew, <br />
The time was come their city to renew. <br />
Then ev&#8217;ry brow with cheerful green is crown&#8217;d, <br />
The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. <br />
When next the rosy morn disclos&#8217;d the day, <br />
The scouts to sev&#8217;ral parts divide their way, <br />
To learn the natives&#8217; names, their towns explore, <br />
The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: <br />
Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; <br />
Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. <br />
The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways <br />
To found his empire, and his town to raise, <br />
A hundred youths from all his train selects, <br />
And to the Latian court their course directs, <br />
(The spacious palace where their prince resides,) <br />
And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. <br />
They go commission&#8217;d to require a peace, <br />
And carry presents to procure access. <br />
Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs <br />
His new-elected seat, and draws the lines. <br />
The Trojans round the place a rampire cast, <br />
And palisades about the trenches plac&#8217;d. <br />
Meantime the train, proceeding on their way, <br />
From far the town and lofty tow&#8217;rs survey; <br />
At length approach the walls. Without the gate, <br />
They see the boys and Latian youth debate <br />
The martial prizes on the dusty plain: <br />
Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; <br />
Some bend the stubborn bow for victory, <br />
And some with darts their active sinews try. <br />
A posting messenger, dispatch&#8217;d from hence, <br />
Of this fair troop advis&#8217;d their aged prince, <br />
That foreign men of mighty stature came; <br />
Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name. <br />
The king ordains their entrance, and ascends <br />
His regal seat, surrounded by his friends. <br />
The palace built by Picus, vast and proud, <br />
Supported by a hundred pillars stood, <br />
And round incompass&#8217;d with a rising wood. <br />
The pile o&#8217;erlook&#8217;d the town, and drew the sight; <br />
Surpris&#8217;d at once with reverence and delight. <br />
There kings receiv&#8217;d the marks of sov&#8217;reign pow&#8217;r; <br />
In state the monarchs march&#8217;d; the lictors bore <br />
Their awful axes and the rods before. <br />
Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray&#8217;r, <br />
And here the sacred senators repair; <br />
All at large tables, in long order set, <br />
A ram their off&#8217;ring, and a ram their meat. <br />
Above the portal, carv&#8217;d in cedar wood, <br />
Plac&#8217;d in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; <br />
Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; <br />
And Italus, that led the colony; <br />
And ancient Janus, with his double face, <br />
And bunch of keys, the porter of the place. <br />
There good Sabinus, planter of the vines, <br />
On a short pruning hook his head reclines, <br />
And studiously surveys his gen&#8217;rous wines; <br />
Then warlike kings, who for their country fought, <br />
And honorable wounds from battle brought. <br />
Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears, <br />
And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars, <br />
And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars. <br />
Above the rest, as chief of all the band, <br />
Was Picus plac&#8217;d, a buckler in his hand; <br />
His other wav&#8217;d a long divining wand. <br />
Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate, <br />
Yet could not with his art avoid his fate: <br />
For Circe long had lov&#8217;d the youth in vain, <br />
Till love, refus&#8217;d, converted to disdain: <br />
Then, mixing pow&#8217;rful herbs, with magic art, <br />
She chang&#8217;d his form, who could not change his heart; <br />
Constrain&#8217;d him in a bird, and made him fly, <br />
With party-color&#8217;d plumes, a chatt&#8217;ring pie. <br />
In this high temple, on a chair of state, <br />
The seat of audience, old Latinus sate; <br />
Then gave admission to the Trojan train; <br />
And thus with pleasing accents he began: <br />
&#8220;Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own, <br />
Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown&#8211; <br />
Say what you seek, and whither were you bound: <br />
Were you by stress of weather cast aground? <br />
(Such dangers as on seas are often seen, <br />
And oft befall to miserable men,) <br />
Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay, <br />
Spent and disabled in so long a way? <br />
Say what you want: the Latians you shall find <br />
Not forc&#8217;d to goodness, but by will inclin&#8217;d; <br />
For, since the time of Saturn&#8217;s holy reign, <br />
His hospitable customs we retain. <br />
I call to mind (but time the tale has worn) <br />
Th&#8217; Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho&#8217; born <br />
On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore, <br />
And Samothracia, Samos call&#8217;d before. <br />
From Tuscan Coritum he claim&#8217;d his birth; <br />
But after, when exempt from mortal earth, <br />
From thence ascended to his kindred skies, <br />
A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice.&#8221; <br />
He said. Ilioneus made this reply: <br />
&#8220;O king, of Faunus&#8217; royal family! <br />
Nor wintry winds to Latium forc&#8217;d our way, <br />
Nor did the stars our wand&#8217;ring course betray. <br />
Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, <br />
The port, so long desir&#8217;d, at length we found; <br />
From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell&#8217;d; <br />
Great as the greatest that the sun beheld. <br />
The god began our line, who rules above; <br />
And, as our race, our king descends from Jove: <br />
And hither are we come, by his command, <br />
To crave admission in your happy land. <br />
How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour&#8217;d, <br />
Our plains, our temples, and our town devour&#8217;d; <br />
What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms <br />
Shook Asia&#8217;s crown with European arms; <br />
Ev&#8217;n such have heard, if any such there be, <br />
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; <br />
And such as, born beneath the burning sky <br />
And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. <br />
From that dire deluge, thro&#8217; the wat&#8217;ry waste, <br />
Such length of years, such various perils past, <br />
At last escap&#8217;d, to Latium we repair, <br />
To beg what you without your want may spare: <br />
The common water, and the common air; <br />
Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, <br />
Fit to receive and serve our banish&#8217;d gods. <br />
Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace, <br />
Nor length of time our gratitude efface. <br />
Besides, what endless honor you shall gain, <br />
To save and shelter Troy&#8217;s unhappy train! <br />
Now, by my sov&#8217;reign, and his fate, I swear, <br />
Renown&#8217;d for faith in peace, for force in war; <br />
Oft our alliance other lands desir&#8217;d, <br />
And, what we seek of you, of us requir&#8217;d. <br />
Despite not then, that in our hands we bear <br />
These holy boughs, and sue with words of pray&#8217;r. <br />
Fate and the gods, by their supreme command, <br />
Have doom&#8217;d our ships to seek the Latian land. <br />
To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends; <br />
Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends; <br />
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, <br />
And where Numicus opes his holy source. <br />
Besides, our prince presents, with his request, <br />
Some small remains of what his sire possess&#8217;d. <br />
This golden charger, snatch&#8217;d from burning Troy, <br />
Anchises did in sacrifice employ; <br />
This royal robe and this tiara wore <br />
Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore <br />
In full assemblies, and in solemn games; <br />
These purple vests were weav&#8217;d by Dardan dames.&#8221; <br />
Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll&#8217;d around <br />
His eyes, and fix&#8217;d a while upon the ground. <br />
Intent he seem&#8217;d, and anxious in his breast; <br />
Not by the scepter mov&#8217;d, or kingly vest, <br />
But pond&#8217;ring future things of wondrous weight; <br />
Succession, empire, and his daughter&#8217;s fate. <br />
On these he mus&#8217;d within his thoughtful mind, <br />
And then revolv&#8217;d what Faunus had divin&#8217;d. <br />
This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed <br />
To share his scepter, and Lavinia&#8217;s bed; <br />
This was the race that sure portents foreshew <br />
To sway the world, and land and sea subdue. <br />
At length he rais&#8217;d his cheerful head, and spoke: <br />
&#8220;The pow&#8217;rs,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the pow&#8217;rs we both invoke, <br />
To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, <br />
And firm our purpose with their augury! <br />
Have what you ask; your presents I receive; <br />
Land, where and when you please, with ample leave; <br />
Partake and use my kingdom as your own; <br />
All shall be yours, while I command the crown: <br />
And, if my wish&#8217;d alliance please your king, <br />
Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring. <br />
Then let him not a friend&#8217;s embraces fear; <br />
The peace is made when I behold him here. <br />
Besides this answer, tell my royal guest, <br />
I add to his commands my own request: <br />
One only daughter heirs my crown and state, <br />
Whom not our oracles, nor Heav&#8217;n, nor fate, <br />
Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join <br />
With any native of th&#8217; Ausonian line. <br />
A foreign son-in-law shall come from far <br />
(Such is our doom), a chief renown&#8217;d in war, <br />
Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name, <br />
And thro&#8217; the conquer&#8217;d world diffuse our fame. <br />
Himself to be the man the fates require, <br />
I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.&#8221; <br />
He said, and then on each bestow&#8217;d a steed. <br />
Three hundred horses, in high stables fed, <br />
Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress&#8217;d: <br />
Of these he chose the fairest and the best, <br />
To mount the Trojan troop. At his command <br />
The steeds caparison&#8217;d with purple stand, <br />
With golden trappings, glorious to behold, <br />
And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. <br />
Then to his absent guest the king decreed <br />
A pair of coursers born of heav&#8217;nly breed, <br />
Who from their nostrils breath&#8217;d ethereal fire; <br />
Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire, <br />
By substituting mares produc&#8217;d on earth, <br />
Whose wombs conceiv&#8217;d a more than mortal birth. <br />
These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, <br />
And the rich present to the prince commends. <br />
Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, <br />
To their expecting lord with peace return. <br />
But jealous Juno, from Pachynus&#8217; height, <br />
As she from Argos took her airy flight, <br />
Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. <br />
She saw the Trojan and his joyful train <br />
Descend upon the shore, desert the main, <br />
Design a town, and, with unhop&#8217;d success, <br />
Th&#8217; embassadors return with promis&#8217;d peace. <br />
Then, pierc&#8217;d with pain, she shook her haughty head, <br />
Sigh&#8217;d from her inward soul, and thus she said: <br />
&#8220;O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! <br />
O fates of Troy, which Juno&#8217;s fates oppose! <br />
Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, <br />
But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? <br />
When execrable Troy in ashes lay, <br />
Thro&#8217; fires and swords and seas they forc&#8217;d their way. <br />
Then vanquish&#8217;d Juno must in vain contend, <br />
Her rage disarm&#8217;d, her empire at an end. <br />
Breathless and tir&#8217;d, is all my fury spent? <br />
Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? <br />
As if &#8216;t were little from their town to chase, <br />
I thro&#8217; the seas pursued their exil&#8217;d race; <br />
Ingag&#8217;d the heav&#8217;ns, oppos&#8217;d the stormy main; <br />
But billows roar&#8217;d, and tempests rag&#8217;d in vain. <br />
What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, <br />
When these they overpass, and those they shun? <br />
On Tiber&#8217;s shores they land, secure of fate, <br />
Triumphant o&#8217;er the storms and Juno&#8217;s hate. <br />
Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, <br />
And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia&#8217;s wrath, <br />
Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; <br />
(What great offense had either people done?) <br />
But I, the consort of the Thunderer, <br />
Have wag&#8217;d a long and unsuccessful war, <br />
With various arts and arms in vain have toil&#8217;d, <br />
And by a mortal man at length am foil&#8217;d. <br />
If native pow&#8217;r prevail not, shall I doubt <br />
To seek for needful succor from without? <br />
If Jove and Heav&#8217;n my just desires deny, <br />
Hell shall the pow&#8217;r of Heav&#8217;n and Jove supply. <br />
Grant that the Fates have firm&#8217;d, by their decree, <br />
The Trojan race to reign in Italy; <br />
At least I can defer the nuptial day, <br />
And with protracted wars the peace delay: <br />
With blood the dear alliance shall be bought, <br />
And both the people near destruction brought; <br />
So shall the son-in-law and father join, <br />
With ruin, war, and waste of either line. <br />
O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow&#8217;d <br />
With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood! <br />
Bellona leads thee to thy lover&#8217;s hand; <br />
Another queen brings forth another brand, <br />
To burn with foreign fires another land! <br />
A second Paris, diff&#8217;ring but in name, <br />
Shall fire his country with a second flame.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, <br />
With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, <br />
To rouse Alecto from th&#8217; infernal seat <br />
Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. <br />
This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; <br />
One who delights in wars and human woes. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Pluto hates his own misshapen race; <br />
Her sister Furies fly her hideous face; <br />
So frightful are the forms the monster takes, <br />
So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes. <br />
Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: <br />
&#8220;O virgin daughter of eternal Night, <br />
Give me this once thy labor, to sustain <br />
My right, and execute my just disdain. <br />
Let not the Trojans, with a feign&#8217;d pretense <br />
Of proffer&#8217;d peace, delude the Latian prince. <br />
Expel from Italy that odious name, <br />
And let not Juno suffer in her fame. <br />
&#8216;T is thine to ruin realms, o&#8217;erturn a state, <br />
Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, <br />
And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate. <br />
Thy hand o&#8217;er towns the fun&#8217;ral torch displays, <br />
And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. <br />
Now shake, from out thy fruitful breast, the seeds <br />
Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: <br />
Confound the peace establish&#8217;d, and prepare <br />
Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war.&#8221; <br />
Smear&#8217;d as she was with black Gorgonian blood, <br />
The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; <br />
And on her wicker wings, sublime thro&#8217; night, <br />
She to the Latian palace took her flight: <br />
There sought the queen&#8217;s apartment, stood before <br />
The peaceful threshold, and besieg&#8217;d the door. <br />
Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast <br />
Fir&#8217;d with disdain for Turnus dispossess&#8217;d, <br />
And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest. <br />
From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes <br />
Her darling plague, the fav&#8217;rite of her snakes; <br />
With her full force she threw the pois&#8217;nous dart, <br />
And fix&#8217;d it deep within Amata&#8217;s heart, <br />
That, thus envenom&#8217;d, she might kindle rage, <br />
And sacrifice to strife her house and husband&#8217;s age. <br />
Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims <br />
Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs; <br />
His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides, <br />
Now like a chain around her neck he rides, <br />
Now like a fillet to her head repairs, <br />
And with his circling volumes folds her hairs. <br />
At first the silent venom slid with ease, <br />
And seiz&#8217;d her cooler senses by degrees; <br />
Then, ere th&#8217; infected mass was fir&#8217;d too far, <br />
In plaintive accents she began the war, <br />
And thus bespoke her husband: &#8220;Shall,&#8221; she said, <br />
&#8220;A wand&#8217;ring prince enjoy Lavinia&#8217;s bed? <br />
If nature plead not in a parent&#8217;s heart, <br />
Pity my tears, and pity her desert. <br />
I know, my dearest lord, the time will come, <br />
You would, in vain, reverse your cruel doom; <br />
The faithless pirate soon will set to sea, <br />
And bear the royal virgin far away! <br />
A guest like him, a Trojan guest before, <br />
In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore, <br />
And ravish&#8217;d Helen from her husband bore. <br />
Think on a king&#8217;s inviolable word; <br />
And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord: <br />
To this false foreigner you give your throne, <br />
And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son. <br />
Resume your ancient care; and, if the god <br />
Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood, <br />
Know all are foreign, in a larger sense, <br />
Not born your subjects, or deriv&#8217;d from hence. <br />
Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace, <br />
He springs from Inachus of Argive race.&#8221; <br />
But when she saw her reasons idly spent, <br />
And could not move him from his fix&#8217;d intent, <br />
She flew to rage; for now the snake possess&#8217;d <br />
Her vital parts, and poison&#8217;d all her breast; <br />
She raves, she runs with a distracted pace, <br />
And fills with horrid howls the public place. <br />
And, as young striplings whip the top for sport, <br />
On the smooth pavement of an empty court; <br />
The wooden engine flies and whirls about, <br />
Admir&#8217;d, with clamors, of the beardless rout; <br />
They lash aloud; each other they provoke, <br />
And lend their little souls at ev&#8217;ry stroke: <br />
Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows <br />
Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. <br />
Nor yet content, she strains her malice more, <br />
And adds new ills to those contriv&#8217;d before: <br />
She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng <br />
Of madding matrons, bears the bride along, <br />
Wand&#8217;ring thro&#8217; woods and wilds, and devious ways, <br />
And with these arts the Trojan match delays. <br />
She feign&#8217;d the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud, <br />
And to the buxom god the virgin vow&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;Evoe! O Bacchus!&#8221; thus began the song; <br />
And &#8220;Evoe!&#8221; answer&#8217;d all the female throng. <br />
&#8220;O virgin! worthy thee alone!&#8221; she cried; <br />
&#8220;O worthy thee alone!&#8221; the crew replied. <br />
&#8220;For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance, <br />
And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.&#8221; <br />
Like fury seiz&#8217;d the rest; the progress known, <br />
All seek the mountains, and forsake the town: <br />
All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav&#8217;lin bear, <br />
Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair, <br />
And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff&#8217;ring air. <br />
The queen herself, inspir&#8217;d with rage divine, <br />
Shook high above her head a flaming pine; <br />
Then roll&#8217;d her haggard eyes around the throng, <br />
And sung, in Turnus&#8217; name, the nuptial song: <br />
&#8220;Io, ye Latian dames! if any here <br />
Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear; <br />
If there be here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;who dare maintain <br />
My right, nor think the name of mother vain; <br />
Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, <br />
And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.&#8221; <br />
Amata&#8217;s breast the Fury thus invades, <br />
And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades; <br />
Then, when she found her venom spread so far, <br />
The royal house embroil&#8217;d in civil war, <br />
Rais&#8217;d on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, <br />
And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies. <br />
His town, as fame reports, was built of old <br />
By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold, <br />
Who fled her father&#8217;s rage, and, with a train <br />
Of following Argives, thro&#8217; the stormy main, <br />
Driv&#8217;n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. <br />
&#8216;T was Ardua once; now Ardea&#8217;s name it bears; <br />
Once a fair city, now consum&#8217;d with years. <br />
Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, <br />
Betwixt the confines of the night and day, <br />
Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside <br />
Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried <br />
The foulness of th&#8217; infernal form to hide. <br />
Propp&#8217;d on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: <br />
Her face is furrow&#8217;d, and her front obscene; <br />
Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; <br />
Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; <br />
Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, <br />
Her temples with an olive wreath are crown&#8217;d. <br />
Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane <br />
Of Juno, now she seem&#8217;d, and thus began, <br />
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: <br />
&#8220;Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain <br />
In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain? <br />
Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, <br />
Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? <br />
The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, <br />
The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. <br />
Go now, deluded man, and seek again <br />
New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. <br />
Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; <br />
Protect the Latians in luxurious ease. <br />
This dream all-pow&#8217;rful Juno sends; I bear <br />
Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. <br />
Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; <br />
With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: <br />
Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie <br />
In Tiber&#8217;s mouth, with fire and sword destroy. <br />
The Latian king, unless he shall submit, <br />
Own his old promise, and his new forget&#8211; <br />
Let him, in arms, the pow&#8217;r of Turnus prove, <br />
And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. <br />
For such is Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s command.&#8221; The youthful prince <br />
With scorn replied, and made this bold defense: <br />
&#8220;You tell me, mother, what I knew before: <br />
The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. <br />
I neither fear nor will provoke the war; <br />
My fate is Juno&#8217;s most peculiar care. <br />
But time has made you dote, and vainly tell <br />
Of arms imagin&#8217;d in your lonely cell. <br />
Go; be the temple and the gods your care; <br />
Permit to men the thought of peace and war.&#8221; <br />
These haughty words Alecto&#8217;s rage provoke, <br />
And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. <br />
Her eyes grow stiffen&#8217;d, and with sulphur burn; <br />
Her hideous looks and hellish form return; <br />
Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, <br />
And open all the furies of her face: <br />
Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes, <br />
She cast him backward as he strove to rise, <br />
And, ling&#8217;ring, sought to frame some new replies. <br />
High on her head she rears two twisted snakes, <br />
Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; <br />
And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks: <br />
&#8220;Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell <br />
Of arms imagin&#8217;d in her lonely cell! <br />
Behold the Fates&#8217; infernal minister! <br />
War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear.&#8221; <br />
Thus having said, her smold&#8217;ring torch, impress&#8217;d <br />
With her full force, she plung&#8217;d into his breast. <br />
Aghast he wak&#8217;d; and, starting from his bed, <br />
Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o&#8217;erspread. <br />
&#8220;Arms! arms!&#8221; he cries: &#8220;my sword and shield prepare!&#8221; <br />
He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war. <br />
So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries, <br />
The bubbling waters from the bottom rise: <br />
Above the brims they force their fiery way; <br />
Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day. <br />
The peace polluted thus, a chosen band <br />
He first commissions to the Latian land, <br />
In threat&#8217;ning embassy; then rais&#8217;d the rest, <br />
To meet in arms th&#8217; intruding Trojan guest, <br />
To force the foes from the Lavinian shore, <br />
And Italy&#8217;s indanger&#8217;d peace restore. <br />
Himself alone an equal match he boasts, <br />
To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts. <br />
The gods invok&#8217;d, the Rutuli prepare <br />
Their arms, and warn each other to the war. <br />
His beauty these, and those his blooming age, <br />
The rest his house and his own fame ingage. <br />
While Turnus urges thus his enterprise, <br />
The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies; <br />
New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand, <br />
Which overlooks the vale with wide command; <br />
Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train, <br />
With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain, <br />
And pitch their toils around the shady plain. <br />
The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent, <br />
And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent. <br />
&#8216;Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise <br />
High o&#8217;er his front; his beams invade the skies. <br />
From this light cause th&#8217; infernal maid prepares <br />
The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars. <br />
The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred, <br />
Snatch&#8217;d from his dams, and the tame youngling fed. <br />
Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring, <br />
Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king: <br />
Their sister Silvia cherish&#8217;d with her care <br />
The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare <br />
To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied <br />
His tender neck, and comb&#8217;d his silken hide, <br />
And bath&#8217;d his body. Patient of command <br />
In time he grew, and, growing us&#8217;d to hand, <br />
He waited at his master&#8217;s board for food; <br />
Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood, <br />
Where grazing all the day, at night he came <br />
To his known lodgings, and his country dame. <br />
This household beast, that us&#8217;d the woodland grounds, <br />
Was view&#8217;d at first by the young hero&#8217;s hounds, <br />
As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat <br />
In the cool waters, and to quench his heat. <br />
Ascanius young, and eager of his game, <br />
Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; <br />
But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, <br />
Which pierc&#8217;d his bowels thro&#8217; his panting sides. <br />
The bleeding creature issues from the floods, <br />
Possess&#8217;d with fear, and seeks his known abodes, <br />
His old familiar hearth and household gods. <br />
He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, <br />
Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans. <br />
Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud <br />
For succor from the clownish neighborhood: <br />
The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay <br />
In the close woody covert, urg&#8217;d their way. <br />
One with a brand yet burning from the flame, <br />
Arm&#8217;d with a knotty club another came: <br />
Whate&#8217;er they catch or find, without their care, <br />
Their fury makes an instrument of war. <br />
Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast, <br />
Then clench&#8217;d a hatchet in his horny fist, <br />
But held his hand from the descending stroke, <br />
And left his wedge within the cloven oak, <br />
To whet their courage and their rage provoke. <br />
And now the goddess, exercis&#8217;d in ill, <br />
Who watch&#8217;d an hour to work her impious will, <br />
Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn, <br />
Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne, <br />
Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around, <br />
And mountains, tremble at th&#8217; infernal sound. <br />
The sacred lake of Trivia from afar, <br />
The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar, <br />
Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war. <br />
Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess&#8217;d, <br />
And strain their helpless infants to their breast. <br />
The clowns, a boist&#8217;rous, rude, ungovern&#8217;d crew, <br />
With furious haste to the loud summons flew. <br />
The pow&#8217;rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain, <br />
With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain: <br />
Not theirs a raw and unexperienc&#8217;d train, <br />
But a firm body of embattled men. <br />
At first, while fortune favor&#8217;d neither side, <br />
The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried; <br />
But now, both parties reinforc&#8217;d, the fields <br />
Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields. <br />
A shining harvest either host displays, <br />
And shoots against the sun with equal rays. <br />
Thus, when a black-brow&#8217;d gust begins to rise, <br />
White foam at first on the curl&#8217;d ocean fries; <br />
Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies; <br />
Till, by the fury of the storm full blown, <br />
The muddy bottom o&#8217;er the clouds is thrown. <br />
First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus&#8217; eldest care, <br />
Pierc&#8217;d with an arrow from the distant war: <br />
Fix&#8217;d in his throat the flying weapon stood, <br />
And stopp&#8217;d his breath, and drank his vital blood <br />
Huge heaps of slain around the body rise: <br />
Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies; <br />
A good old man, while peace he preach&#8217;d in vain, <br />
Amidst the madness of th&#8217; unruly train: <br />
Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill&#8217;d; <br />
His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till&#8217;d. <br />
Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood <br />
The Fury bath&#8217;d them in each other&#8217;s blood; <br />
Then, having fix&#8217;d the fight, exulting flies, <br />
And bears fulfill&#8217;d her promise to the skies. <br />
To Juno thus she speaks: &#8220;Behold! &#8216;t is done, <br />
The blood already drawn, the war begun; <br />
The discord is complete; nor can they cease <br />
The dire debate, nor you command the peace. <br />
Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood <br />
Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood; <br />
Speak, and my pow&#8217;r shall add this office more: <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring nations of th&#8217; Ausonian shore <br />
Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar, <br />
Of arm&#8217;d invasion, and embrace the war.&#8221; <br />
Then Juno thus: &#8220;The grateful work is done, <br />
The seeds of discord sow&#8217;d, the war begun; <br />
Frauds, fears, and fury have possess&#8217;d the state, <br />
And fix&#8217;d the causes of a lasting hate. <br />
A bloody Hymen shall th&#8217; alliance join <br />
Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line: <br />
But thou with speed to night and hell repair; <br />
For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear <br />
Thy lawless wand&#8217;ring walks in upper air. <br />
Leave what remains to me.&#8221; Saturnia said: <br />
The sullen fiend her sounding wings display&#8217;d, <br />
Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. <br />
In midst of Italy, well known to fame, <br />
There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name) <br />
Below the lofty mounts: on either side <br />
Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide. <br />
Full in the center of the sacred wood <br />
An arm arises of the Stygian flood, <br />
Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, <br />
Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around. <br />
Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell, <br />
And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. <br />
To this infernal lake the Fury flies; <br />
Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab&#8217;ring skies. <br />
Saturnian Juno now, with double care, <br />
Attends the fatal process of the war. <br />
The clowns, return&#8217;d, from battle bear the slain, <br />
Implore the gods, and to their king complain. <br />
The corps of Almon and the rest are shown; <br />
Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town. <br />
Ambitious Turnus in the press appears, <br />
And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears; <br />
Proclaims his private injuries aloud, <br />
A solemn promise made, and disavow&#8217;d; <br />
A foreign son is sought, and a mix&#8217;d mungril brood. <br />
Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear, <br />
In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear, <br />
And lead his dances with dishevel&#8217;d hair, <br />
Increase the clamor, and the war demand, <br />
(Such was Amata&#8217;s interest in the land,) <br />
Against the public sanctions of the peace, <br />
Against all omens of their ill success. <br />
With fates averse, the rout in arms resort, <br />
To force their monarch, and insult the court. <br />
But, like a rock unmov&#8217;d, a rock that braves <br />
The raging tempest and the rising waves&#8211; <br />
Propp&#8217;d on himself he stands; his solid sides <br />
Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides&#8211; <br />
So stood the pious prince, unmov&#8217;d, and long <br />
Sustain&#8217;d the madness of the noisy throng. <br />
But, when he found that Juno&#8217;s pow&#8217;r prevail&#8217;d, <br />
And all the methods of cool counsel fail&#8217;d, <br />
He calls the gods to witness their offense, <br />
Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence. <br />
&#8220;Hurried by fate,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;and borne before <br />
A furious wind, we leave the faithful shore. <br />
O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear <br />
The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war: <br />
Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate, <br />
And pray to Heav&#8217;n for peace, but pray too late. <br />
For me, my stormy voyage at an end, <br />
I to the port of death securely tend. <br />
The fun&#8217;ral pomp which to your kings you pay, <br />
Is all I want, and all you take away.&#8221; <br />
He said no more, but, in his walls confin&#8217;d, <br />
Shut out the woes which he too well divin&#8217;d; <br />
Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive, <br />
But left the helm, and let the vessel drive. <br />
A solemn custom was observ&#8217;d of old, <br />
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold, <br />
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear <br />
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare <br />
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war; <br />
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain <br />
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae&#8217;s bloody plain. <br />
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear, <br />
And still are worship&#8217;d with religious fear) <br />
Before his temple stand: the dire abode, <br />
And the fear&#8217;d issues of the furious god, <br />
Are fenc&#8217;d with brazen bolts; without the gates, <br />
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits. <br />
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars, <br />
The Roman consul their decree declares, <br />
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. <br />
The youth in military shouts arise, <br />
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. <br />
These rites, of old by sov&#8217;reign princes us&#8217;d, <br />
Were the king&#8217;s office; but the king refus&#8217;d, <br />
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar <br />
Of sacred peace, or loose th&#8217; imprison&#8217;d war; <br />
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, <br />
Abhorr&#8217;d the wicked ministry of arms. <br />
Then heav&#8217;n&#8217;s imperious queen shot down from high: <br />
At her approach the brazen hinges fly; <br />
The gates are forc&#8217;d, and ev&#8217;ry falling bar; <br />
And, like a tempest, issues out the war. <br />
The peaceful cities of th&#8217; Ausonian shore, <br />
Lull&#8217;d in their ease, and undisturb&#8217;d before, <br />
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care, <br />
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare; <br />
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try, <br />
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen&#8217;ral cry. <br />
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part <br />
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: <br />
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly, <br />
And hear the trumpet&#8217;s clangor pierce the sky. <br />
Five cities forge their arms: th&#8217; Atinian pow&#8217;rs, <br />
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow&#8217;rs, <br />
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: <br />
All these of old were places of renown. <br />
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field; <br />
Some twine young sallows to support the shield; <br />
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold, <br />
With silver plated, and with ductile gold. <br />
The rustic honors of the scythe and share <br />
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. <br />
Old fauchions are new temper&#8217;d in the fires; <br />
The sounding trumpet ev&#8217;ry soul inspires. <br />
The word is giv&#8217;n; with eager speed they lace <br />
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace. <br />
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied; <br />
The trusty weapon sits on ev&#8217;ry side. <br />
And now the mighty labor is begun&#8211; <br />
Ye Muses, open all your Helicon. <br />
Sing you the chiefs that sway&#8217;d th&#8217; Ausonian land, <br />
Their arms, and armies under their command; <br />
What warriors in our ancient clime were bred; <br />
What soldiers follow&#8217;d, and what heroes led. <br />
For well you know, and can record alone, <br />
What fame to future times conveys but darkly down. <br />
Mezentius first appear&#8217;d upon the plain: <br />
Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, <br />
Defying earth and heav&#8217;n. Etruria lost, <br />
He brings to Turnus&#8217; aid his baffled host. <br />
The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, <br />
Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; <br />
To Turnus only second in the grace <br />
Of manly mien, and features of the face. <br />
A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, <br />
With fates averse a thousand men he led: <br />
His sire unworthy of so brave a son; <br />
Himself well worthy of a happier throne. <br />
Next Aventinus drives his chariot round <br />
The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown&#8217;d. <br />
Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; <br />
His father&#8217;s hydra fills his ample shield: <br />
A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; <br />
The son of Hercules he justly seems <br />
By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; <br />
Of heav&#8217;nly part, and part of earthly blood, <br />
A mortal woman mixing with a god. <br />
For strong Alcides, after he had slain <br />
The triple Geryon, drove from conquer&#8217;d Spain <br />
His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, <br />
On Tuscan Tiber&#8217;s flow&#8217;ry banks they fed. <br />
Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove <br />
The priestess Rhea found, and forc&#8217;d to love. <br />
For arms, his men long piles and jav&#8217;lins bore; <br />
And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. <br />
Like Hercules himself his son appears, <br />
In salvage pomp; a lion&#8217;s hide he wears; <br />
About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; <br />
The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. <br />
Thus, like the god his father, homely dress&#8217;d, <br />
He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. <br />
Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, <br />
(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,) <br />
Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: <br />
Arm&#8217;d Argive horse they led, and in the front appear. <br />
Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain&#8217;s height <br />
With rapid course descending to the fight; <br />
They rush along; the rattling woods give way; <br />
The branches bend before their sweepy sway. <br />
Nor was Praeneste&#8217;s founder wanting there, <br />
Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: <br />
Found in the fire, and foster&#8217;d in the plains, <br />
A shepherd and a king at once he reigns, <br />
And leads to Turnus&#8217; aid his country swains. <br />
His own Praeneste sends a chosen band, <br />
With those who plow Saturnia&#8217;s Gabine land; <br />
Besides the succor which cold Anien yields, <br />
The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields, <br />
Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene&#8211; <br />
A num&#8217;rous rout, but all of naked men: <br />
Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield, <br />
Nor drive the chariot thro&#8217; the dusty field, <br />
But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, <br />
And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; <br />
The left foot naked, when they march to fight, <br />
But in a bull&#8217;s raw hide they sheathe the right. <br />
Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,) <br />
Secure of steel, and fated from the fire, <br />
In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms <br />
A heartless train, unexercis&#8217;d in arms: <br />
The just Faliscans he to battle brings, <br />
And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs; <br />
And where Feronia&#8217;s grove and temple stands, <br />
Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands. <br />
All these in order march, and marching sing <br />
The warlike actions of their sea-born king; <br />
Like a long team of snowy swans on high, <br />
Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky, <br />
When, homeward from their wat&#8217;ry pastures borne, <br />
They sing, and Asia&#8217;s lakes their notes return. <br />
Not one who heard their music from afar, <br />
Would think these troops an army train&#8217;d to war, <br />
But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, <br />
With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. <br />
Then Clausus came, who led a num&#8217;rous band <br />
Of troops embodied from the Sabine land, <br />
And, in himself alone, an army brought. <br />
&#8216;T was he, the noble Claudian race begot, <br />
The Claudian race, ordain&#8217;d, in times to come, <br />
To share the greatness of imperial Rome. <br />
He led the Cures forth, of old renown, <br />
Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, <br />
And all th&#8217; Eretian pow&#8217;rs; besides a band <br />
That follow&#8217;d from Velinum&#8217;s dewy land, <br />
And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, <br />
And mountaineers, that from Severus came, <br />
And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, <br />
And those where yellow Tiber takes his way, <br />
And where Himella&#8217;s wanton waters play. <br />
Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie <br />
By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: <br />
The warlike aids of Horta next appear, <br />
And the cold Nursians come to close the rear, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the natives born of Latine blood, <br />
Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood. <br />
Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main, <br />
When pale Orion sets in wintry rain; <br />
Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, <br />
Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies, <br />
Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; <br />
Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. <br />
High in his chariot then Halesus came, <br />
A foe by birth to Troy&#8217;s unhappy name: <br />
From Agamemnon born&#8211;to Turnus&#8217; aid <br />
A thousand men the youthful hero led, <br />
Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown&#8217;d, <br />
And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground, <br />
And those who live by Sidicinian shores, <br />
And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars, <br />
Cales&#8217; and Osca&#8217;s old inhabitants, <br />
And rough Saticulans, inur&#8217;d to wants: <br />
Light demi-lances from afar they throw, <br />
Fasten&#8217;d with leathern thongs, to gall the foe. <br />
Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear; <br />
And on their warding arm light bucklers bear. <br />
Nor OEbalus, shalt thou be left unsung, <br />
From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung, <br />
Who then in Teleboan Capri reign&#8217;d; <br />
But that short isle th&#8217; ambitious youth disdain&#8217;d, <br />
And o&#8217;er Campania stretch&#8217;d his ample sway, <br />
Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea; <br />
O&#8217;er Batulum, and where Abella sees, <br />
From her high tow&#8217;rs, the harvest of her trees. <br />
And these (as was the Teuton use of old) <br />
Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold; <br />
Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight; <br />
Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light. <br />
Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went, <br />
And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent. <br />
The rude Equicolae his rule obey&#8217;d; <br />
Hunting their sport, and plund&#8217;ring was their trade. <br />
In arms they plow&#8217;d, to battle still prepar&#8217;d: <br />
Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard. <br />
Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led, <br />
By King Archippus sent to Turnus&#8217; aid, <br />
And peaceful olives crown&#8217;d his hoary head. <br />
His wand and holy words, the viper&#8217;s rage, <br />
And venom&#8217;d wounds of serpents could assuage. <br />
He, when he pleas&#8217;d with powerful juice to steep <br />
Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. <br />
But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art, <br />
To cure the wound giv&#8217;n by the Dardan dart: <br />
Yet his untimely fate th&#8217; Angitian woods <br />
In sighs remurmur&#8217;d to the Fucine floods. <br />
The son of fam&#8217;d Hippolytus was there, <br />
Fam&#8217;d as his sire, and, as his mother, fair; <br />
Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore, <br />
And nurs&#8217;d his youth along the marshy shore, <br />
Where great Diana&#8217;s peaceful altars flame, <br />
In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name. <br />
Hippolytus, as old records have said, <br />
Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed; <br />
But, when no female arts his mind could move, <br />
She turn&#8217;d to furious hate her impious love. <br />
Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore, <br />
Another&#8217;s crimes th&#8217; unhappy hunter bore, <br />
Glutting his father&#8217;s eyes with guiltless gore. <br />
But chaste Diana, who his death deplor&#8217;d, <br />
With AEsculapian herbs his life restor&#8217;d. <br />
Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain, <br />
The dead inspir&#8217;d with vital breath again, <br />
Struck to the center, with his flaming dart, <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy founder of the godlike art. <br />
But Trivia kept in secret shades alone <br />
Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown; <br />
And call&#8217;d him Virbius in th&#8217; Egerian grove, <br />
Where then he liv&#8217;d obscure, but safe from Jove. <br />
For this, from Trivia&#8217;s temple and her wood <br />
Are coursers driv&#8217;n, who shed their master&#8217;s blood, <br />
Affrighted by the monsters of the flood. <br />
His son, the second Virbius, yet retain&#8217;d <br />
His father&#8217;s art, and warrior steeds he rein&#8217;d. <br />
Amid the troops, and like the leading god, <br />
High o&#8217;er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode: <br />
A triple pile of plumes his crest adorn&#8217;d, <br />
On which with belching flames Chimaera burn&#8217;d: <br />
The more the kindled combat rises high&#8217;r, <br />
The more with fury burns the blazing fire. <br />
Fair Io grac&#8217;d his shield; but Io now <br />
With horns exalted stands, and seems to low&#8211; <br />
A noble charge! Her keeper by her side, <br />
To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied; <br />
And on the brims her sire, the wat&#8217;ry god, <br />
Roll&#8217;d from a silver urn his crystal flood. <br />
A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields <br />
With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt&#8217;ring shields; <br />
Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands, <br />
And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands; <br />
Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields, <br />
And the proud Labicans, with painted shields, <br />
And those who near Numician streams reside. <br />
And those whom Tiber&#8217;s holy forests hide, <br />
Or Circe&#8217;s hills from the main land divide; <br />
Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands, <br />
Or the black water of Pomptina stands. <br />
Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came, <br />
And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame; <br />
Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill&#8217;d, <br />
She chose the nobler Pallas of the field. <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the first, the fierce virago fought, <br />
Sustain&#8217;d the toils of arms, the danger sought, <br />
Outstripp&#8217;d the winds in speed upon the plain, <br />
Flew o&#8217;er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain: <br />
She swept the seas, and, as she skimm&#8217;d along, <br />
Her flying feet unbath&#8217;d on billows hung. <br />
Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise, <br />
Where&#8217;er she passes, fix their wond&#8217;ring eyes: <br />
Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight, <br />
Devour her o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er with vast delight; <br />
Her purple habit sits with such a grace <br />
On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; <br />
Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown&#8217;d, <br />
And in a golden caul the curls are bound. <br />
She shakes her myrtle jav&#8217;lin; and, behind, <br />
Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.</p>
