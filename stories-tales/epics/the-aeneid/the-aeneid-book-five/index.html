				<p>THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; AEneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a<br />
storm on the coasts of Sicily, where he is hospitably receiv&#8217;d by his<br />
friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan<br />
parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father<br />
with divine honors, and accordingly institutes funeral games, and<br />
appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the<br />
ceremonies were performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan<br />
women to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them;<br />
which burnt four, and would have consum&#8217;d the rest, had not Jupi-<br />
ter, by a miraculous shower, extinguish&#8217;d it. Upon this, AEneas, by<br />
the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds<br />
a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for<br />
war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures<br />
of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only<br />
his pilot Palinurus, who is unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>MEANTIME the Trojan cuts his wat&#8217;ry way, <br />
Fix&#8217;d on his voyage, thro&#8217; the curling sea; <br />
Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, <br />
Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. <br />
The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind <br />
The fate of Dido from the fire divin&#8217;d; <br />
He knew the stormy souls of womankind, <br />
What secret springs their eager passions move, <br />
How capable of death for injur&#8217;d love. <br />
Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; <br />
Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. <br />
Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; <br />
An empty space above, a floating field around. <br />
But soon the heav&#8217;ns with shadows were o&#8217;erspread; <br />
A swelling cloud hung hov&#8217;ring o&#8217;er their head: <br />
Livid it look&#8217;d, the threat&#8217;ning of a storm: <br />
Then night and horror ocean&#8217;s face deform. <br />
The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: <br />
&#8220;What gusts of weather from that gath&#8217;ring cloud <br />
My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, <br />
Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; <br />
Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.&#8221; <br />
The frighted crew perform the task assign&#8217;d. <br />
Then, to his fearless chief: &#8220;Not Heav&#8217;n,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;Tho&#8217; Jove himself should promise Italy, <br />
Can stem the torrent of this raging sea. <br />
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, <br />
And what collected night involves the skies! <br />
Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, <br />
Much less against the tempest force their way. <br />
&#8216;T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. <br />
Not far from hence, if I observ&#8217;d aright <br />
The southing of the stars, and polar light, <br />
Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores <br />
In safety we may reach with struggling oars.&#8221; <br />
AEneas then replied: &#8220;Too sure I find <br />
We strive in vain against the seas and wind: <br />
Now shift your sails; what place can please me more <br />
Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, <br />
Whose hallow&#8217;d earth Anchises&#8217; bones contains, <br />
And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?&#8221; <br />
The course resolv&#8217;d, before the western wind <br />
They scud amain, and make the port assign&#8217;d. <br />
Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, <br />
Beheld the fleet descending on the land; <br />
And, not unmindful of his ancient race, <br />
Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, <br />
And held the hero in a strict embrace. <br />
Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, <br />
And either hand a pointed jav&#8217;lin bore. <br />
His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; <br />
His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. <br />
He welcomes his returning friends ashore <br />
With plenteous country cates and homely store. <br />
Now, when the following morn had chas&#8217;d away <br />
The flying stars, and light restor&#8217;d the day, <br />
AEneas call&#8217;d the Trojan troops around, <br />
And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: <br />
&#8220;Offspring of heav&#8217;n, divine Dardanian race! <br />
The sun, revolving thro&#8217; th&#8217; ethereal space, <br />
The shining circle of the year has fill&#8217;d, <br />
Since first this isle my father&#8217;s ashes held: <br />
And now the rising day renews the year; <br />
A day for ever sad, for ever dear. <br />
This would I celebrate with annual games, <br />
With gifts on altars pil&#8217;d, and holy flames, <br />
Tho&#8217; banish&#8217;d to Gaetulia&#8217;s barren sands, <br />
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: <br />
But since this happy storm our fleet has driv&#8217;n <br />
(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav&#8217;n) <br />
Upon these friendly shores and flow&#8217;ry plains, <br />
Which hide Anchises and his blest remains, <br />
Let us with joy perform his honors due, <br />
And pray for prosp&#8217;rous winds, our voyage to renew; <br />
Pray, that in towns and temples of our own, <br />
The name of great Anchises may be known, <br />
And yearly games may spread the gods&#8217; renown. <br />
Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race, <br />
With royal gifts ordain&#8217;d, is pleas&#8217;d to grace: <br />
Two steers on ev&#8217;ry ship the king bestows; <br />
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows. <br />
Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn <br />
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn, <br />
That day with solemn sports I mean to grace: <br />
Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat&#8217;ry race; <br />
Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend, <br />
And others try the twanging bow to bend; <br />
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm&#8217;d, shall stand <br />
Oppos&#8217;d in combat on the yellow sand. <br />
Let all be present at the games prepar&#8217;d, <br />
And joyful victors wait the just reward. <br />
But now assist the rites, with garlands crown&#8217;d.&#8221; <br />
He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. <br />
Then Helymus, by his example led, <br />
And old Acestes, each adorn&#8217;d his head; <br />
Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, <br />
His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. <br />
AEneas then advanc&#8217;d amidst the train, <br />
By thousands follow&#8217;d thro&#8217; the flow&#8217;ry plain, <br />
To great Anchises&#8217; tomb; which when he found, <br />
He pour&#8217;d to Bacchus, on the hallow&#8217;d ground, <br />
Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, <br />
And two (from offer&#8217;d bulls) of purple gore, <br />
With roses then the sepulcher he strow&#8217;d <br />
And thus his father&#8217;s ghost bespoke aloud: <br />
&#8220;Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, <br />
Paternal ashes, now review&#8217;d in vain! <br />
The gods permitted not, that you, with me, <br />
Should reach the promis&#8217;d shores of Italy, <br />
Or Tiber&#8217;s flood, what flood soe&#8217;er it be.&#8221; <br />
Scarce had he finish&#8217;d, when, with speckled pride, <br />
A serpent from the tomb began to glide; <br />
His hugy bulk on sev&#8217;n high volumes roll&#8217;d; <br />
Blue was his breadth of back, but streak&#8217;d with scaly gold: <br />
Thus riding on his curls, he seem&#8217;d to pass <br />
A rolling fire along, and singe the grass. <br />
More various colors thro&#8217; his body run, <br />
Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. <br />
Betwixt the rising altars, and around, <br />
The sacred monster shot along the ground; <br />
With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass&#8217;d, <br />
And with his lolling tongue assay&#8217;d the taste: <br />
Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest <br />
Within the hollow tomb retir&#8217;d to rest. <br />
The pious prince, surpris&#8217;d at what he view&#8217;d, <br />
The fun&#8217;ral honors with more zeal renew&#8217;d, <br />
Doubtful if this place&#8217;s genius were, <br />
Or guardian of his father&#8217;s sepulcher. <br />
Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew; <br />
As many swine, and steers of sable hue; <br />
New gen&#8217;rous wine he from the goblets pour&#8217;d. <br />
And call&#8217;d his father&#8217;s ghost, from hell restor&#8217;d. <br />
The glad attendants in long order come, <br />
Off&#8217;ring their gifts at great Anchises&#8217; tomb: <br />
Some add more oxen; some divide the spoil; <br />
Some place the chargers on the grassy soil; <br />
Some blow the fires, and offer&#8217;d entrails broil. <br />
Now came the day desir&#8217;d. The skies were bright <br />
With rosy luster of the rising light: <br />
The bord&#8217;ring people, rous&#8217;d by sounding fame <br />
Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes&#8217; name, <br />
The crowded shore with acclamations fill, <br />
Part to behold, and part to prove their skill. <br />
And first the gifts in public view they place, <br />
Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors&#8217; grace: <br />
Within the circle, arms and tripods lie, <br />
Ingots of gold and silver, heap&#8217;d on high, <br />
And vests embroider&#8217;d, of the Tyrian dye. <br />
The trumpet&#8217;s clangor then the feast proclaims, <br />
And all prepare for their appointed games. <br />
Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear, <br />
Advancing, in the wat&#8217;ry lists appear. <br />
The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, <br />
Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind: <br />
Gyas the vast Chimaera&#8217;s bulk commands, <br />
Which rising, like a tow&#8217;ring city stands; <br />
Three Trojans tug at ev&#8217;ry lab&#8217;ring oar; <br />
Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore; <br />
Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. <br />
Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race, <br />
In the great Centaur took the leading place; <br />
Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, <br />
From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. <br />
Far in the sea, against the foaming shore, <br />
There stands a rock: the raging billows roar <br />
Above his head in storms; but, when &#8216;t is clear, <br />
Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. <br />
In peace below the gentle waters run; <br />
The cormorants above lie basking in the sun. <br />
On this the hero fix&#8217;d an oak in sight, <br />
The mark to guide the mariners aright. <br />
To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; <br />
Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. <br />
The lots decide their place. Above the rest, <br />
Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest; <br />
The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs <br />
Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: <br />
Besmear&#8217;d with oil, their naked shoulders shine. <br />
All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: <br />
They gripe their oars; and ev&#8217;ry panting breast <br />
Is rais&#8217;d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress&#8217;d. <br />
The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign; <br />
At once they start, advancing in a line: <br />
With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; <br />
Lash&#8217;d with their oars, the smoky billows rise; <br />
Sparkles the briny main, and the vex&#8217;d ocean fries. <br />
Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: <br />
At once the brushing oars and brazen prow <br />
Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. <br />
Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, <br />
Invade the field with half so swift a pace; <br />
Not the fierce driver with more fury lends <br />
The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, <br />
Low to the wheels his pliant body bends. <br />
The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, <br />
And aid with eager shouts the favor&#8217;d side. <br />
Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound, <br />
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. <br />
Amidst the loud applauses of the shore, <br />
Gyas outstripp&#8217;d the rest, and sprung before: <br />
Cloanthus, better mann&#8217;d, pursued him fast, <br />
But his o&#8217;er-masted galley check&#8217;d his haste. <br />
The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine <br />
With equal oars, advancing in a line; <br />
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, <br />
And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead; <br />
Now board to board the rival vessels row, <br />
The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below. <br />
They reach&#8217;d the mark. Proud Gyas and his train <br />
In triumph rode, the victors of the main; <br />
But, steering round, he charg&#8217;d his pilot stand <br />
More close to shore, and skim along the sand&#8211; <br />
&#8220;Let others bear to sea!&#8221; Menoetes heard; <br />
But secret shelves too cautiously he fear&#8217;d, <br />
And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer&#8217;d. <br />
With louder cries the captain call&#8217;d again: <br />
&#8220;Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.&#8221; <br />
He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw <br />
The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw. <br />
Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood, <br />
And in a closer compass plow&#8217;d the flood. <br />
He pass&#8217;d the mark; and, wheeling, got before: <br />
Gyas blasphem&#8217;d the gods, devoutly swore, <br />
Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore. <br />
Mindless of others&#8217; lives (so high was grown <br />
His rising rage) and careless of his own, <br />
The trembling dotard to the deck he drew; <br />
Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw: <br />
This done, he seiz&#8217;d the helm; his fellows cheer&#8217;d, <br />
Turn&#8217;d short upon the shelfs, and madly steer&#8217;d. <br />
Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears, <br />
Clogg&#8217;d with his clothes, and cumber&#8217;d with his years: <br />
Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. <br />
The crowd, that saw him fall and float again, <br />
Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh&#8217;d, <br />
To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. <br />
The following Centaur, and the Dolphin&#8217;s crew, <br />
Their vanish&#8217;d hopes of victory renew; <br />
While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race, <br />
To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place; <br />
Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind, <br />
Comes up, not half his galley&#8217;s length behind; <br />
Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear&#8217;d, <br />
And thus their drooping courage he cheer&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;My friends, and Hector&#8217;s followers heretofore, <br />
Exert your vigor; tug the lab&#8217;ring oar; <br />
Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer&#8217;d crew, <br />
Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. <br />
In this, our common int&#8217;rest, let me find <br />
That strength of hand, that courage of the mind, <br />
As when you stemm&#8217;d the strong Malean flood, <br />
And o&#8217;er the Syrtes&#8217; broken billows row&#8217;d. <br />
I seek not now the foremost palm to gain; <br />
Tho&#8217; yet&#8211;but ah! that haughty wish is vain! <br />
Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. <br />
But to be last, the lags of all the race!&#8211; <br />
Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.&#8221; <br />
Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row <br />
At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. <br />
The sea beneath &#8216;em sinks; their lab&#8217;ring sides <br />
Are swell&#8217;d, and sweat runs gutt&#8217;ring down in tides. <br />
Chance aids their daring with unhop&#8217;d success; <br />
Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press <br />
Betwixt the rival galley and the rock, <br />
Shuts up th&#8217; unwieldly Centaur in the lock. <br />
The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock, <br />
Her oars she shiver&#8217;d, and her head she broke. <br />
The trembling rowers from their banks arise, <br />
And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize. <br />
With iron poles they heave her off the shores, <br />
And gather from the sea their floating oars. <br />
The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds, <br />
Urge their success, and call the willing winds; <br />
Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way <br />
In larger compass on the roomy sea. <br />
As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes, <br />
Rous&#8217;d in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; <br />
The cavern rings with clatt&#8217;ring; out she flies, <br />
And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies: <br />
At first she flutters; but at length she springs <br />
To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: <br />
So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea; <br />
And, flying with a force, that force assists his way. <br />
Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass&#8217;d, <br />
Wedg&#8217;d in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. <br />
In vain the victor he with cries implores, <br />
And practices to row with shatter&#8217;d oars. <br />
Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: <br />
The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize. <br />
Unvanquish&#8217;d Scylla now alone remains; <br />
Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains. <br />
Shouts from the fav&#8217;ring multitude arise; <br />
Applauding Echo to the shouts replies; <br />
Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard, <br />
Much grudg&#8217;d the praise, but more the robb&#8217;d reward: <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to hold their own, they mend their pace, <br />
All obstinate to die, or gain the race. <br />
Rais&#8217;d with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran; <br />
For they can conquer, who believe they can. <br />
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies, <br />
And both perhaps had shar&#8217;d an equal prize; <br />
When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, <br />
And succor from the wat&#8217;ry pow&#8217;rs demands: <br />
&#8220;Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row! <br />
If, giv&#8217;n by you, the laurel bind my brow, <br />
Assist to make me guilty of my vow! <br />
A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; <br />
His offer&#8217;d entrails cast into the main, <br />
And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown, <br />
Your grateful gift and my return shall own.&#8221; <br />
The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below, <br />
With virgin Panopea, heard his vow; <br />
And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand, <br />
Push&#8217;d on, and sped the galley to the land. <br />
Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies, <br />
And, darting to the port, obtains the prize. <br />
The herald summons all, and then proclaims <br />
Cloanthus conqu&#8217;ror of the naval games. <br />
The prince with laurel crowns the victor&#8217;s head, <br />
And three fat steers are to his vessel led, <br />
The ship&#8217;s reward; with gen&#8217;rous wine beside, <br />
And sums of silver, which the crew divide. <br />
The leaders are distinguish&#8217;d from the rest; <br />
The victor honor&#8217;d with a nobler vest, <br />
Where gold and purple strive in equal rows, <br />
And needlework its happy cost bestows. <br />
There Ganymede is wrought with living art, <br />
Chasing thro&#8217; Ida&#8217;s groves the trembling hart: <br />
Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; <br />
When from aloft descends, in open view, <br />
The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey, <br />
With crooked talons bears the boy away. <br />
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes, <br />
His guards behold him soaring thro&#8217; the skies, <br />
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. <br />
Mnestheus the second victor was declar&#8217;d; <br />
And, summon&#8217;d there, the second prize he shar&#8217;d. <br />
A coat of mail, which brave Demoleus bore, <br />
More brave AEneas from his shoulders tore, <br />
In single combat on the Trojan shore: <br />
This was ordain&#8217;d for Mnestheus to possess; <br />
In war for his defense, for ornament in peace. <br />
Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold, <br />
But yet so pond&#8217;rous with its plates of gold, <br />
That scarce two servants could the weight sustain; <br />
Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o&#8217;er the plain <br />
Pursued and lightly seiz&#8217;d the Trojan train. <br />
The third, succeeding to the last reward, <br />
Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar&#8217;d, <br />
With figures prominent, and richly wrought, <br />
And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. <br />
Thus all, rewarded by the hero&#8217;s hands, <br />
Their conqu&#8217;ring temples bound with purple bands; <br />
And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock, <br />
Brought back his galley shatter&#8217;d with the shock. <br />
Forlorn she look&#8217;d, without an aiding oar, <br />
And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. <br />
As when a snake, surpris&#8217;d upon the road, <br />
Is crush&#8217;d athwart her body by the load <br />
Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound <br />
Her belly bruis&#8217;d, and trodden to the ground: <br />
In vain, with loosen&#8217;d curls, she crawls along; <br />
Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; <br />
Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; <br />
But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails: <br />
So slowly to the port the Centaur tends, <br />
But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. <br />
Yet, for his galley sav&#8217;d, the grateful prince <br />
Is pleas&#8217;d th&#8217; unhappy chief to recompense. <br />
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, <br />
Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. <br />
From thence his way the Trojan hero bent <br />
Into the neighb&#8217;ring plain, with mountains pent, <br />
Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. <br />
Full in the midst of this fair valley stood <br />
A native theater, which, rising slow <br />
By just degrees, o&#8217;erlook&#8217;d the ground below. <br />
High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; <br />
A num&#8217;rous train attend in solemn state. <br />
Here those that in the rapid course delight, <br />
Desire of honor and the prize invite. <br />
The rival runners without order stand; <br />
The Trojans mix&#8217;d with the Sicilian band. <br />
First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; <br />
Euryalus a boy of blooming years, <br />
With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown&#8217;d; <br />
Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown&#8217;d. <br />
Diores next, of Priam&#8217;s royal race, <br />
Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; <br />
(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, <br />
And Salius his from Arcananian earth;) <br />
Then two Sicilian youths&#8211;the names of these, <br />
Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: <br />
Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, <br />
And owning old Acestes for their head; <br />
With sev&#8217;ral others of ignobler name, <br />
Whom time has not deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to fame. <br />
To these the hero thus his thoughts explain&#8217;d, <br />
In words which gen&#8217;ral approbation gain&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;One common largess is for all design&#8217;d, <br />
(The vanquish&#8217;d and the victor shall be join&#8217;d,) <br />
Two darts of polish&#8217;d steel and Gnosian wood, <br />
A silver-studded ax, alike bestow&#8217;d. <br />
The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: <br />
The first of these obtains a stately steed, <br />
Adorn&#8217;d with trappings; and the next in fame, <br />
The quiver of an Amazonian dame, <br />
With feather&#8217;d Thracian arrows well supplied: <br />
A golden belt shall gird his manly side, <br />
Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. <br />
The third this Grecian helmet shall content.&#8221; <br />
He said. To their appointed base they went; <br />
With beating hearts th&#8217; expected sign receive, <br />
And, starting all at once, the barrier leave. <br />
Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, <br />
And seiz&#8217;d the distant goal with greedy view. <br />
Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o&#8217;erpass&#8217;d; <br />
Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. <br />
The next, but tho&#8217; the next, yet far disjoin&#8217;d, <br />
Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; <br />
Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, <br />
Step after step, and almost side by side, <br />
His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, <br />
Had won, or left at least a dubious race. <br />
Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, <br />
When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, <br />
Slipp&#8217;d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, <br />
Soak&#8217;d with the blood of oxen newly slain. <br />
The careless victor had not mark&#8217;d his way; <br />
But, treading where the treach&#8217;rous puddle lay, <br />
His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor <br />
He fell, besmear&#8217;d with filth and holy gore. <br />
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, <br />
Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, <br />
He strove th&#8217; immediate rival&#8217;s hope to cross, <br />
And caught the foot of Salius as he rose. <br />
So Salius lay extended on the plain; <br />
Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, <br />
And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend <br />
The victor to the goal, who vanquish&#8217;d by his friend. <br />
Next Helymus; and then Diores came, <br />
By two misfortunes made the third in fame. <br />
But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud <br />
For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; <br />
Urges his cause may in the court be heard; <br />
And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr&#8217;d. <br />
But favor for Euryalus appears; <br />
His blooming beauty, with his tender tears, <br />
Had brib&#8217;d the judges for the promis&#8217;d prize. <br />
Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, <br />
Who vainly reaches at the last reward, <br />
If the first palm on Salius be conferr&#8217;d. <br />
Then thus the prince: &#8220;Let no disputes arise: <br />
Where fortune plac&#8217;d it, I award the prize. <br />
But fortune&#8217;s errors give me leave to mend, <br />
At least to pity my deserving friend.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws <br />
(Pond&#8217;rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) <br />
A lion&#8217;s hide: to Salius this he gives. <br />
Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. <br />
&#8220;If such rewards to vanquish&#8217;d men are due.&#8221; <br />
He said, &#8220;and falling is to rise by you, <br />
What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, <br />
Who merited the first rewards and fame? <br />
In falling, both an equal fortune tried; <br />
Would fortune for my fall so well provide!&#8221; <br />
With this he pointed to his face, and show&#8217;d <br />
His hand and all his habit smear&#8217;d with blood. <br />
Th&#8217; indulgent father of the people smil&#8217;d, <br />
And caus&#8217;d to be produc&#8217;d an ample shield, <br />
Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, <br />
Long since from Neptune&#8217;s bars in triumph brought. <br />
This giv&#8217;n to Nisus, he divides the rest, <br />
And equal Justice in his gifts express&#8217;d. <br />
The race thus ended, and rewards bestow&#8217;d, <br />
Once more the prince bespeaks th&#8217; attentive crowd: <br />
&#8220;If there be here whose dauntless courage dare <br />
In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare, <br />
His opposite sustain in open view, <br />
Stand forth the champion, and the games renew. <br />
Two prizes I propose, and thus divide: <br />
A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, <br />
Shall be the portion of the conqu&#8217;ring chief; <br />
A sword and helm shall cheer the loser&#8217;s grief.&#8221; <br />
Then haughty Dares in the lists appears; <br />
Stalking he strides, his head erected bears: <br />
His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, <br />
And loud applauses echo thro&#8217; the field. <br />
Dares alone in combat us&#8217;d to stand <br />
The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand; <br />
The same, at Hector&#8217;s fun&#8217;rals, undertook <br />
Gigantic Butes, of th&#8217; Amycian stock, <br />
And, by the stroke of his resistless hand, <br />
Stretch&#8217;d the vast bulk upon the yellow sand. <br />
Such Dares was; and such he strode along, <br />
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng. <br />
His brawny back and ample breast he shows, <br />
His lifted arms around his head he throws, <br />
And deals in whistling air his empty blows. <br />
His match is sought; but, thro&#8217; the trembling band, <br />
Not one dares answer to the proud demand. <br />
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes <br />
Already he devours the promis&#8217;d prize. <br />
He claims the bull with awless insolence, <br />
And having seiz&#8217;d his horns, accosts the prince: <br />
&#8220;If none my matchless valor dares oppose, <br />
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes? <br />
Permit me, chief, permit without delay, <br />
To lead this uncontended gift away.&#8221; <br />
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries <br />
For the proud challenger demands the prize. <br />
Acestes, fir&#8217;d with just disdain, to see <br />
The palm usurp&#8217;d without a victory, <br />
Reproach&#8217;d Entellus thus, who sate beside, <br />
And heard and saw, unmov&#8217;d, the Trojan&#8217;s pride: <br />
&#8220;Once, but in vain, a champion of renown, <br />
So tamely can you bear the ravish&#8217;d crown, <br />
A prize in triumph borne before your sight, <br />
And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? <br />
Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name, <br />
The god who taught your thund&#8217;ring arm the game? <br />
Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil <br />
That fill&#8217;d your house, and fame that fill&#8217;d our isle?&#8221; <br />
Entellus, thus: &#8220;My soul is still the same, <br />
Unmov&#8217;d with fear, and mov&#8217;d with martial fame; <br />
But my chill blood is curdled in my veins, <br />
And scarce the shadow of a man remains. <br />
O could I turn to that fair prime again, <br />
That prime of which this boaster is so vain, <br />
The brave, who this decrepid age defies, <br />
Should feel my force, without the promis&#8217;d prize.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, rising at the word, he threw <br />
Two pond&#8217;rous gauntlets down in open view; <br />
Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield, <br />
And sheathe his hands with in the listed field. <br />
With fear and wonder seiz&#8217;d, the crowd beholds <br />
The gloves of death, with sev&#8217;n distinguish&#8217;d folds <br />
Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread <br />
With iron, or with loads of heavy lead: <br />
Dares himself was daunted at the sight, <br />
Renounc&#8217;d his challenge, and refus&#8217;d to fight. <br />
Astonish&#8217;d at their weight, the hero stands, <br />
And pois&#8217;d the pond&#8217;rous engines in his hands. <br />
&#8220;What had your wonder,&#8221; said Entellus, &#8220;been, <br />
Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen, <br />
Or view&#8217;d the stern debate on this unhappy green! <br />
These which I bear your brother Eryx bore, <br />
Still mark&#8217;d with batter&#8217;d brains and mingled gore. <br />
With these he long sustain&#8217;d th&#8217; Herculean arm; <br />
And these I wielded while my blood was warm, <br />
This languish&#8217;d frame while better spirits fed, <br />
Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o&#8217;ersnow&#8217;d my head. <br />
But if the challenger these arms refuse, <br />
And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; <br />
If great AEneas and Acestes join <br />
In his request, these gauntlets I resign; <br />
Let us with equal arms perform the fight, <br />
And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.&#8221; <br />
This said, Entellus for the strife prepares; <br />
Stripp&#8217;d of his quilted coat, his body bares; <br />
Compos&#8217;d of mighty bones and brawn he stands, <br />
A goodly tow&#8217;ring object on the sands. <br />
Then just AEneas equal arms supplied, <br />
Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. <br />
Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent, <br />
Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent; <br />
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar; <br />
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war. <br />
One on his youth and pliant limbs relies; <br />
One on his sinews and his giant size. <br />
The last is stiff with age, his motion slow; <br />
He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, <br />
And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. <br />
Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike; <br />
Their ways are diff&#8217;rent, but their art alike. <br />
Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around <br />
Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. <br />
A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies, <br />
And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes. <br />
Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws <br />
A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws. <br />
Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, <br />
But with his warping body wards the wound. <br />
His hand and watchful eye keep even pace; <br />
While Dares traverses and shifts his place, <br />
And, like a captain who beleaguers round <br />
Some strong-built castle on a rising ground, <br />
Views all th&#8217; approaches with observing eyes: <br />
This and that other part in vain he tries, <br />
And more on industry than force relies. <br />
With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; <br />
But Dares watch&#8217;d the motion from below, <br />
And slipp&#8217;d aside, and shunn&#8217;d the long descending blow. <br />
Entellus wastes his forces on the wind, <br />
And, thus deluded of the stroke design&#8217;d, <br />
Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast <br />
And weighty limbs his ancient mother press&#8217;d. <br />
So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood <br />
On Ida&#8217;s height, or Erymanthus&#8217; wood, <br />
Torn from the roots. The diff&#8217;ring nations rise, <br />
And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, <br />
Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise <br />
The fall&#8217;n companion of his youthful days. <br />
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return&#8217;d; <br />
With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn&#8217;d. <br />
Disdain and conscious virtue fir&#8217;d his breast, <br />
And with redoubled force his foe he press&#8217;d. <br />
He lays on load with either hand, amain, <br />
And headlong drives the Trojan o&#8217;er the plain; <br />
Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; <br />
But storms of strokes descend about his brows, <br />
A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. <br />
But now the prince, who saw the wild increase <br />
Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, <br />
And bounds Entellus&#8217; wrath, and bids the peace. <br />
First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, <br />
And sooth&#8217;d his sorrow for the suffer&#8217;d shame. <br />
&#8220;What fury seiz&#8217;d my friend? The gods,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;To him propitious, and averse to thee, <br />
Have giv&#8217;n his arm superior force to thine. <br />
&#8216;T is madness to contend with strength divine.&#8221; <br />
The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore <br />
His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore: <br />
His mouth and nostrils pour&#8217;d a purple flood, <br />
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood. <br />
Faintly he stagger&#8217;d thro&#8217; the hissing throng, <br />
And hung his head, and trail&#8217;d his legs along. <br />
The sword and casque are carried by his train; <br />
But with his foe the palm and ox remain. <br />
The champion, then, before AEneas came, <br />
Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: <br />
&#8220;O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, <br />
Mark with attention, and forgive my boast; <br />
Learn what I was, by what remains; and know <br />
From what impending fate you sav&#8217;d my foe.&#8221; <br />
Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; <br />
And, on his ample forehead aiming full, <br />
The deadly stroke, descending, pierc&#8217;d the skull. <br />
Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, <br />
But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground. <br />
Then, thus: &#8220;In Dares&#8217; stead I offer this. <br />
Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; <br />
Take the last gift my wither&#8217;d arms can yield: <br />
Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.&#8221; <br />
This done, AEneas orders, for the close, <br />
The strife of archers with contending bows. <br />
The mast Sergesthus&#8217; shatter&#8217;d galley bore <br />
With his own hands he raises on the shore. <br />
A flutt&#8217;ring dove upon the top they tie, <br />
The living mark at which their arrows fly. <br />
The rival archers in a line advance, <br />
Their turn of shooting to receive from chance. <br />
A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn: <br />
On the first scroll was read Hippocoon. <br />
The people shout. Upon the next was found <br />
Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown&#8217;d. <br />
The third contain&#8217;d Eurytion&#8217;s noble name, <br />
Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame, <br />
Whom Pallas urg&#8217;d the treaty to confound, <br />
And send among the Greeks a feather&#8217;d wound. <br />
Acestes in the bottom last remain&#8217;d, <br />
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain&#8217;d. <br />
Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows, <br />
And from the quiver each his arrow chose. <br />
Hippocoon&#8217;s was the first: with forceful sway <br />
It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. <br />
Fix&#8217;d in the mast the feather&#8217;d weapon stands: <br />
The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, <br />
And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries <br />
Of the pleas&#8217;d people rend the vaulted skies. <br />
Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, <br />
With lifted eyes, and took his aim above, <br />
But made a glancing shot, and miss&#8217;d the dove; <br />
Yet miss&#8217;d so narrow, that he cut the cord <br />
Which fasten&#8217;d by the foot the flitting bird. <br />
The captive thus releas&#8217;d, away she flies, <br />
And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies. <br />
His bow already bent, Eurytion stood; <br />
And, having first invok&#8217;d his brother god, <br />
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped. <br />
The fatal message reach&#8217;d her as she fled: <br />
She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground, <br />
And renders back the weapon in the wound. <br />
Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains, <br />
Without a prize to gratify his pains. <br />
Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show <br />
An archer&#8217;s art, and boast his twanging bow. <br />
The feather&#8217;d arrow gave a dire portent, <br />
And latter augurs judge from this event. <br />
Chaf&#8217;d by the speed, it fir&#8217;d; and, as it flew, <br />
A trail of following flames ascending drew: <br />
Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; <br />
Across the skies as falling meteors play, <br />
And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. <br />
The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare, <br />
And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray&#8217;r. <br />
The Dardan prince put on a smiling face, <br />
And strain&#8217;d Acestes with a close embrace; <br />
Then, hon&#8217;ring him with gifts above the rest, <br />
Turn&#8217;d the bad omen, nor his fears confess&#8217;d. <br />
&#8220;The gods,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this miracle have wrought, <br />
And order&#8217;d you the prize without the lot. <br />
Accept this goblet, rough with figur&#8217;d gold, <br />
Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old: <br />
This pledge of ancient amity receive, <br />
Which to my second sire I justly give.&#8221; <br />
He said, and, with the trumpets&#8217; cheerful sound, <br />
Proclaim&#8217;d him victor, and with laurel crown&#8217;d. <br />
Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize, <br />
Tho&#8217; he transfix&#8217;d the pigeon in the skies. <br />
Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac&#8217;d; <br />
The third was his whose arrow pierc&#8217;d the mast. <br />
The chief, before the games were wholly done, <br />
Call&#8217;d Periphantes, tutor to his son, <br />
And whisper&#8217;d thus: &#8220;With speed Ascanius find; <br />
And, if his childish troop be ready join&#8217;d, <br />
On horseback let him grace his grandsire&#8217;s day, <br />
And lead his equals arm&#8217;d in just array.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. <br />
The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears. <br />
And now the noble youths, of form divine, <br />
Advance before their fathers, in a line; <br />
The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine. <br />
Thus marching on in military pride, <br />
Shouts of applause resound from side to side. <br />
Their casques adorn&#8217;d with laurel wreaths they wear, <br />
Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear. <br />
Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore; <br />
Their chains of burnish&#8217;d gold hung down before. <br />
Three graceful troops they form&#8217;d upon the green; <br />
Three graceful leaders at their head were seen; <br />
Twelve follow&#8217;d ev&#8217;ry chief, and left a space between. <br />
The first young Priam led; a lovely boy, <br />
Whose grandsire was th&#8217; unhappy king of Troy; <br />
His race in after times was known to fame, <br />
New honors adding to the Latian name; <br />
And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. <br />
White were the fetlocks of his feet before, <br />
And on his front a snowy star he bore. <br />
Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred, <br />
Of equal age, the second squadron led. <br />
The last in order, but the first in place, <br />
First in the lovely features of his face, <br />
Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed, <br />
Queen Dido&#8217;s gift, and of the Tyrian breed. <br />
Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains, <br />
With golden bits adorn&#8217;d, and purple reins. <br />
The pleas&#8217;d spectators peals of shouts renew, <br />
And all the parents in the children view; <br />
Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, <br />
And hopes and fears alternate in their face. <br />
Th&#8217; unfledg&#8217;d commanders and their martial train <br />
First make the circuit of the sandy plain <br />
Around their sires, and, at th&#8217; appointed sign, <br />
Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line. <br />
The second signal sounds, the troop divides <br />
In three distinguish&#8217;d parts, with three distinguish&#8217;d guides. <br />
Again they close, and once again disjoin; <br />
In troop to troop oppos&#8217;d, and line to line. <br />
They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar <br />
With harmless rage and well-dissembled war. <br />
Then in a round the mingled bodies run: <br />
Flying they follow, and pursuing shun; <br />
Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew <br />
In other forms the military shew. <br />
At last, in order, undiscern&#8217;d they join, <br />
And march together in a friendly line. <br />
And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old, <br />
With wand&#8217;ring ways and many a winding fold, <br />
Involv&#8217;d the weary feet, without redress, <br />
In a round error, which denied recess; <br />
So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, <br />
Turn&#8217;d and return&#8217;d, and still a diff&#8217;rent way. <br />
Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase <br />
In circles, when they swim around the wat&#8217;ry race. <br />
This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught; <br />
And, building Alba, to the Latins brought; <br />
Shew&#8217;d what he learn&#8217;d: the Latin sires impart <br />
To their succeeding sons the graceful art; <br />
From these imperial Rome receiv&#8217;d the game, <br />
Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name. <br />
Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate: <br />
But Fortune soon resum&#8217;d her ancient hate; <br />
For, while they pay the dead his annual dues, <br />
Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views; <br />
And sends the goddess of the various bow, <br />
To try new methods of revenge below; <br />
Supplies the winds to wing her airy way, <br />
Where in the port secure the navy lay. <br />
Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends, <br />
And, undiscern&#8217;d, her fatal voyage ends. <br />
She saw the gath&#8217;ring crowd; and, gliding thence, <br />
The desart shore, and fleet without defense. <br />
The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, <br />
With sighs and tears Anchises&#8217; death bemoan; <br />
Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, <br />
Their pity to themselves renews their cries. <br />
&#8220;Alas!&#8221; said one, &#8220;what oceans yet remain <br />
For us to sail! what labors to sustain!&#8221; <br />
All take the word, and, with a gen&#8217;ral groan, <br />
Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own. <br />
The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, <br />
And in a woman&#8217;s form her heav&#8217;nly limbs restrains. <br />
In face and shape old Beroe she became, <br />
Doryclus&#8217; wife, a venerable dame, <br />
Once blest with riches, and a mother&#8217;s name. <br />
Thus chang&#8217;d, amidst the crying crowd she ran, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the matrons, and these words began: <br />
&#8220;O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow&#8217;r, <br />
Nor flames, destroy&#8217;d, in Troy&#8217;s unhappy hour! <br />
O wretched we, reserv&#8217;d by cruel fate, <br />
Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! <br />
Now sev&#8217;n revolving years are wholly run, <br />
Since this improsp&#8217;rous voyage we begun; <br />
Since, toss&#8217;d from shores to shores, from lands to lands, <br />
Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, <br />
Wand&#8217;ring in exile thro&#8217; the stormy sea, <br />
We search in vain for flying Italy. <br />
Now cast by fortune on this kindred land, <br />
What should our rest and rising walls withstand, <br />
Or hinder here to fix our banish&#8217;d band? <br />
O country lost, and gods redeem&#8217;d in vain, <br />
If still in endless exile we remain! <br />
Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, <br />
Or streams of some dissembled Simois view! <br />
Haste, join with me, th&#8217; unhappy fleet consume! <br />
Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. <br />
In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands <br />
(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: <br />
&#8216;With these,&#8217; said she, &#8216;these wand&#8217;ring ships destroy: <br />
These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.&#8217; <br />
Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: <br />
Slack not the good presage, while Heav&#8217;n inspires <br />
Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. <br />
See! Neptune&#8217;s altars minister their brands: <br />
The god is pleas&#8217;d; the god supplies our hands.&#8221; <br />
Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew, <br />
And, toss&#8217;d in air, amidst the galleys threw. <br />
Wrapp&#8217;d in amaze, the matrons wildly stare: <br />
Then Pyrgo, reverenc&#8217;d for her hoary hair, <br />
Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam&#8217;s num&#8217;rous race: <br />
&#8220;No Beroe this, tho&#8217; she belies her face! <br />
What terrors from her frowning front arise! <br />
Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes! <br />
What rays around her heav&#8217;nly face are seen! <br />
Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien! <br />
Beroe but now I left, whom, pin&#8217;d with pain, <br />
Her age and anguish from these rites detain,&#8221; <br />
She said. The matrons, seiz&#8217;d with new amaze, <br />
Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze. <br />
They fear, and hope, and neither part obey: <br />
They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way. <br />
The goddess, having done her task below, <br />
Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow. <br />
Struck with the sight, and seiz&#8217;d with rage divine, <br />
The matrons prosecute their mad design: <br />
They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands, <br />
The food of altars; fires and flaming brands. <br />
Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste, <br />
And smoking torches, on the ships they cast. <br />
The flame, unstopp&#8217;d at first, more fury gains, <br />
And Vulcan rides at large with loosen&#8217;d reins: <br />
Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars, <br />
And seizes, in his way, the banks and crackling oars. <br />
Eumelus was the first the news to bear, <br />
While yet they crowd the rural theater. <br />
Then, what they hear, is witness&#8217;d by their eyes: <br />
A storm of sparkles and of flames arise. <br />
Ascanius took th&#8217; alarm, while yet he led <br />
His early warriors on his prancing steed, <br />
And, spurring on, his equals soon o&#8217;erpass&#8217;d; <br />
Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste. <br />
Soon as the royal youth appear&#8217;d in view, <br />
He sent his voice before him as he flew: <br />
&#8220;What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy <br />
The last remainders of unhappy Troy! <br />
Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, <br />
And on your friends your fatal fury turn. <br />
Behold your own Ascanius!&#8221; While he said, <br />
He drew his glitt&#8217;ring helmet from his head, <br />
In which the youths to sportful arms he led. <br />
By this, AEneas and his train appear; <br />
And now the women, seiz&#8217;d with shame and fear, <br />
Dispers&#8217;d, to woods and caverns take their flight, <br />
Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; <br />
Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, <br />
And shake the goddess from their alter&#8217;d mind. <br />
Not so the raging fires their fury cease, <br />
But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, <br />
Work on their way amid the smold&#8217;ring tow, <br />
Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. <br />
The silent plague thro&#8217; the green timber eats, <br />
And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. <br />
Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, <br />
The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; <br />
Nor buckets pour&#8217;d, nor strength of human hand, <br />
Can the victorious element withstand. <br />
The pious hero rends his robe, and throws <br />
To heav&#8217;n his hands, and with his hands his vows. <br />
&#8220;O Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8216;if pray&#8217;rs can yet have place; <br />
If thou abhorr&#8217;st not all the Dardan race; <br />
If any spark of pity still remain; <br />
If gods are gods, and not invok&#8217;d in vain; <br />
Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train! <br />
Yet from the flames our burning vessels free, <br />
Or let thy fury fall alone on me! <br />
At this devoted head thy thunder throw, <br />
And send the willing sacrifice below!&#8221; <br />
Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise: <br />
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; <br />
Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; <br />
Heav&#8217;n bellies downward, and descends in rain. <br />
Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent, <br />
Which, hissing thro&#8217; the planks, the flames prevent, <br />
And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone <br />
Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone. <br />
But doubtful thoughts the hero&#8217;s heart divide; <br />
If he should still in Sicily reside, <br />
Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main, <br />
In hope the promis&#8217;d Italy to gain. <br />
Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone <br />
The will of Heav&#8217;n by Pallas was foreshown; <br />
Vers&#8217;d in portents, experienc&#8217;d, and inspir&#8217;d <br />
To tell events, and what the fates requir&#8217;d; <br />
Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin&#8217;d, <br />
With cheerful words reliev&#8217;d his lab&#8217;ring mind: <br />
&#8220;O goddess-born, resign&#8217;d in ev&#8217;ry state, <br />
With patience bear, with prudence push your fate. <br />
By suff&#8217;ring well, our Fortune we subdue; <br />
Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue. <br />
Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind; <br />
To him disclose the secrets of your mind: <br />
Trust in his hands your old and useless train; <br />
Too num&#8217;rous for the ships which yet remain: <br />
The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease, <br />
The dames who dread the dangers of the seas, <br />
With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand <br />
The shock of battle with your foes by land. <br />
Here you may build a common town for all, <br />
And, from Acestes&#8217; name, Acesta call.&#8221; <br />
The reasons, with his friend&#8217;s experience join&#8217;d, <br />
Encourag&#8217;d much, but more disturb&#8217;d his mind. <br />
&#8216;T was dead of night; when to his slumb&#8217;ring eyes <br />
His father&#8217;s shade descended from the skies, <br />
And thus he spoke: &#8220;O more than vital breath, <br />
Lov&#8217;d while I liv&#8217;d, and dear ev&#8217;n after death; <br />
O son, in various toils and troubles toss&#8217;d, <br />
The King of Heav&#8217;n employs my careful ghost <br />
On his commands: the god, who sav&#8217;d from fire <br />
Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire. <br />
The wholesome counsel of your friend receive, <br />
And here the coward train and women leave: <br />
The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare, <br />
Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war. <br />
The stern Italians will their courage try; <br />
Rough are their manners, and their minds are high. <br />
But first to Pluto&#8217;s palace you shall go, <br />
And seek my shade among the blest below: <br />
For not with impious ghosts my soul remains, <br />
Nor suffers with the damn&#8217;d perpetual pains, <br />
But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains. <br />
The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey, <br />
And blood of offer&#8217;d victims free the way. <br />
There shall you know what realms the gods assign, <br />
And learn the fates and fortunes of your line. <br />
But now, farewell! I vanish with the night, <br />
And feel the blast of heav&#8217;n&#8217;s approaching light.&#8221; <br />
He said, and mix&#8217;d with shades, and took his airy flight. <br />
&#8220;Whither so fast?&#8221; the filial duty cried; <br />
&#8220;And why, ah why, the wish&#8217;d embrace denied?&#8221; <br />
He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires, <br />
He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires; <br />
His country gods and Vesta then adores <br />
With cakes and incense, and their aid implores. <br />
Next, for his friends and royal host he sent, <br />
Reveal&#8217;d his vision, and the gods&#8217; intent, <br />
With his own purpose. All, without delay, <br />
The will of Jove, and his desires obey. <br />
They list with women each degenerate name, <br />
Who dares not hazard life for future fame. <br />
These they cashier: the brave remaining few, <br />
Oars, banks, and cables, half consum&#8217;d, renew. <br />
The prince designs a city with the plow; <br />
The lots their sev&#8217;ral tenements allow. <br />
This part is nam&#8217;d from Ilium, that from Troy, <br />
And the new king ascends the throne with joy; <br />
A chosen senate from the people draws; <br />
Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws. <br />
Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin <br />
A rising temple to the Paphian queen. <br />
Anchises, last, is honor&#8217;d as a god; <br />
A priest is added, annual gifts bestow&#8217;d, <br />
And groves are planted round his blest abode. <br />
Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown&#8217;d; <br />
And fumes of incense in the fanes abound. <br />
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze <br />
That curl&#8217;d the smoothness of the glassy seas; <br />
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford, <br />
And call the merry mariners aboard. <br />
Now loud laments along the shores resound, <br />
Of parting friends in close embraces bound. <br />
The trembling women, the degenerate train, <br />
Who shunn&#8217;d the frightful dangers of the main, <br />
Ev&#8217;n those desire to sail, and take their share <br />
Of the rough passage and the promis&#8217;d war: <br />
Whom good AEneas cheers, and recommends <br />
To their new master&#8217;s care his fearful friends. <br />
On Eryx&#8217;s altars three fat calves he lays; <br />
A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas; <br />
Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs. <br />
High on the deck the godlike hero stands, <br />
With olive crown&#8217;d, a charger in his hands; <br />
Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine, <br />
And pour&#8217;d the sacrifice of purple wine. <br />
Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie, <br />
And brush the buxom seas, and o&#8217;er the billows fly. <br />
Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears, <br />
To Neptune thus address&#8217;d, with tender tears: <br />
&#8220;The pride of Jove&#8217;s imperious queen, the rage, <br />
The malice which no suff&#8217;rings can assuage, <br />
Compel me to these pray&#8217;rs; since neither fate, <br />
Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate: <br />
Ev&#8217;n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife; <br />
Still vanquish&#8217;d, yet she still renews the strife. <br />
As if &#8216;t were little to consume the town <br />
Which aw&#8217;d the world, and wore th&#8217; imperial crown, <br />
She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains, <br />
And gnaws, ev&#8217;n to the bones, the last remains. <br />
Let her the causes of her hatred tell; <br />
But you can witness its effects too well. <br />
You saw the storm she rais&#8217;d on Libyan floods, <br />
That mix&#8217;d the mounting billows with the clouds; <br />
When, bribing AEolus, she shook the main, <br />
And mov&#8217;d rebellion in your wat&#8217;ry reign. <br />
With fury she possess&#8217;d the Dardan dames, <br />
To burn their fleet with execrable flames, <br />
And forc&#8217;d AEneas, when his ships were lost, <br />
To leave his foll&#8217;wers on a foreign coast. <br />
For what remains, your godhead I implore, <br />
And trust my son to your protecting pow&#8217;r. <br />
If neither Jove&#8217;s nor Fate&#8217;s decree withstand, <br />
Secure his passage to the Latian land.&#8221; <br />
Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main: <br />
&#8220;What may not Venus hope from Neptune&#8217;s reign? <br />
My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense <br />
Of your indanger&#8217;d fleet may claim your confidence. <br />
Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare <br />
How much your lov&#8217;d AEneas is my care. <br />
Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. <br />
Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press&#8217;d, <br />
And drove before him headlong on the plain, <br />
And dash&#8217;d against the walls the trembling train; <br />
When floods were fill&#8217;d with bodies of the slain; <br />
When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, <br />
Stood up on ridges to behold the sea; <br />
(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok&#8217;d his way;) <br />
When your AEneas fought, but fought with odds <br />
Of force unequal, and unequal gods; <br />
I spread a cloud before the victor&#8217;s sight, <br />
Sustain&#8217;d the vanquish&#8217;d, and secur&#8217;d his flight; <br />
Ev&#8217;n then secur&#8217;d him, when I sought with joy <br />
The vow&#8217;d destruction of ungrateful Troy. <br />
My will&#8217;s the same: fair goddess, fear no more, <br />
Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; <br />
Their lives are giv&#8217;n; one destin&#8217;d head alone <br />
Shall perish, and for multitudes atone.&#8221; <br />
Thus having arm&#8217;d with hopes her anxious mind, <br />
His finny team Saturnian Neptune join&#8217;d, <br />
Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, <br />
And to the loosen&#8217;d reins permits the laws. <br />
High on the waves his azure car he guides; <br />
Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, <br />
And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. <br />
The tempests fly before their father&#8217;s face, <br />
Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace, <br />
And monster whales before their master play, <br />
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat&#8217;ry way. <br />
The marshal&#8217;d pow&#8217;rs in equal troops divide <br />
To right and left; the gods his better side <br />
Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride. <br />
Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude, <br />
Within the hero&#8217;s mind his joys renew&#8217;d. <br />
He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; <br />
The cheerful crew with diligence obey; <br />
They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. <br />
Ahead of all the master pilot steers; <br />
And, as he leads, the following navy veers. <br />
The steeds of Night had travel&#8217;d half the sky, <br />
The drowsy rowers on their benches lie, <br />
When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight, <br />
Descends, and draws behind a trail of light. <br />
Thou, Palinurus, art his destin&#8217;d prey; <br />
To thee alone he takes his fatal way. <br />
Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears; <br />
And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears. <br />
Then thus the traitor god began his tale: <br />
&#8220;The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; <br />
The ships, without thy care, securely sail. <br />
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I <br />
Will take the rudder and thy room supply.&#8221; <br />
To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep: <br />
&#8220;Me dost thou bid to trust the treach&#8217;rous deep, <br />
The harlot smiles of her dissembling face, <br />
And to her faith commit the Trojan race? <br />
Shall I believe the Siren South again, <br />
And, oft betray&#8217;d, not know the monster main?&#8221; <br />
He said: his fasten&#8217;d hands the rudder keep, <br />
And, fix&#8217;d on heav&#8217;n, his eyes repel invading sleep. <br />
The god was wroth, and at his temples threw <br />
A branch in Lethe dipp&#8217;d, and drunk with Stygian dew: <br />
The pilot, vanquish&#8217;d by the pow&#8217;r divine, <br />
Soon clos&#8217;d his swimming eyes, and lay supine. <br />
Scarce were his limbs extended at their length, <br />
The god, insulting with superior strength, <br />
Fell heavy on him, plung&#8217;d him in the sea, <br />
And, with the stern, the rudder tore away. <br />
Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main, <br />
Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain. <br />
The victor daemon mounts obscure in air, <br />
While the ship sails without the pilot&#8217;s care. <br />
On Neptune&#8217;s faith the floating fleet relies; <br />
But what the man forsook, the god supplies, <br />
And o&#8217;er the dang&#8217;rous deep secure the navy flies; <br />
Glides by the Sirens&#8217; cliffs, a shelfy coast, <br />
Long infamous for ships and sailors lost, <br />
And white with bones. Th&#8217; impetuous ocean roars, <br />
And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores. <br />
The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found <br />
The tossing vessel sail&#8217;d on shoaly ground. <br />
Sure of his pilot&#8217;s loss, he takes himself <br />
The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. <br />
Inly he griev&#8217;d, and, groaning from the breast, <br />
Deplor&#8217;d his death; and thus his pain express&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;For faith repos&#8217;d on seas, and on the flatt&#8217;ring sky, <br />
Thy naked corpse is doom&#8217;d on shores unknown to lie.&#8221;</p>
