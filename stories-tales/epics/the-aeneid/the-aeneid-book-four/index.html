				<p>THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; Dido discovers to her sister her passion for<br />
AEneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting<br />
match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus&#8217;s consent, raises a<br />
storm, which separates the hunters, and drives AEneas and Dido<br />
into the same cave, where their marriage is suppos&#8217;d to be com-<br />
pleted. Jupiter dispatches Mercury to AEneas, to warn him from<br />
Carthage. AEneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out<br />
his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her<br />
sister&#8217;s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are<br />
incident to a neglected lover. When nothing would prevail upon<br />
him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes.</p>
<p>BUT anxious cares already seiz&#8217;d the queen: <br />
She fed within her veins a flame unseen; <br />
The hero&#8217;s valor, acts, and birth inspire <br />
Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. <br />
His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, <br />
Improve the passion, and increase the smart. <br />
Now, when the purple morn had chas&#8217;d away <br />
The dewy shadows, and restor&#8217;d the day, <br />
Her sister first with early care she sought, <br />
And thus in mournful accents eas&#8217;d her thought: <br />
&#8220;My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright <br />
My lab&#8217;ring soul! what visions of the night <br />
Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast <br />
With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! <br />
His worth, his actions, and majestic air, <br />
A man descended from the gods declare. <br />
Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; <br />
His birth is well asserted by his mind. <br />
Then, what he suffer&#8217;d, when by Fate betray&#8217;d! <br />
What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! <br />
Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, <br />
That, were I not resolv&#8217;d against the yoke <br />
Of hapless marriage, never to be curst <br />
With second love, so fatal was my first, <br />
To this one error I might yield again; <br />
For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, <br />
This only man is able to subvert <br />
The fix&#8217;d foundations of my stubborn heart. <br />
And, to confess my frailty, to my shame, <br />
Somewhat I find within, if not the same, <br />
Too like the sparkles of my former flame. <br />
But first let yawning earth a passage rend, <br />
And let me thro&#8217; the dark abyss descend; <br />
First let avenging Jove, with flames from high, <br />
Drive down this body to the nether sky, <br />
Condemn&#8217;d with ghosts in endless night to lie, <br />
Before I break the plighted faith I gave! <br />
No! he who had my vows shall ever have; <br />
For, whom I lov&#8217;d on earth, I worship in the grave.&#8221; <br />
She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes, <br />
And stopp&#8217;d her speech. Her sister thus replies: <br />
&#8220;O dearer than the vital air I breathe, <br />
Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath, <br />
Condemn&#8217;d to waste in woes your lonely life, <br />
Without the joys of mother or of wife? <br />
Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe, <br />
Are known or valued by the ghosts below? <br />
I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green, <br />
It well became a woman, and a queen, <br />
The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect, <br />
To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject, <br />
With all the Libyan lords of mighty name; <br />
But will you fight against a pleasing flame! <br />
This little spot of land, which Heav&#8217;n bestows, <br />
On ev&#8217;ry side is hemm&#8217;d with warlike foes; <br />
Gaetulian cities here are spread around, <br />
And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound; <br />
Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land, <br />
And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand; <br />
Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore, <br />
And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more. <br />
Propitious Heav&#8217;n, and gracious Juno, lead <br />
This wand&#8217;ring navy to your needful aid: <br />
How will your empire spread, your city rise, <br />
From such a union, and with such allies? <br />
Implore the favor of the pow&#8217;rs above, <br />
And leave the conduct of the rest to love. <br />
Continue still your hospitable way, <br />
And still invent occasions of their stay, <br />
Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, <br />
And planks and oars repair their shatter&#8217;d fleet.&#8221; <br />
These words, which from a friend and sister came, <br />
With ease resolv&#8217;d the scruples of her fame, <br />
And added fury to the kindled flame. <br />
Inspir&#8217;d with hope, the project they pursue; <br />
On ev&#8217;ry altar sacrifice renew: <br />
A chosen ewe of two years old they pay <br />
To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day; <br />
Preferring Juno&#8217;s pow&#8217;r, for Juno ties <br />
The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys. <br />
The beauteous queen before her altar stands, <br />
And holds the golden goblet in her hands. <br />
A milk-white heifer she with flow&#8217;rs adorns, <br />
And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; <br />
And, while the priests with pray&#8217;r the gods invoke, <br />
She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, <br />
With hourly care the sacrifice renews, <br />
And anxiously the panting entrails views. <br />
What priestly rites, alas! what pious art, <br />
What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! <br />
A gentle fire she feeds within her veins, <br />
Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. <br />
Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves, <br />
From street to street the raving Dido roves. <br />
So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, <br />
Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind, <br />
Distracted with her pain she flies the woods, <br />
Bounds o&#8217;er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, <br />
With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart <br />
Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. <br />
And now she leads the Trojan chief along <br />
The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; <br />
Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, <br />
Which love, without his labor, makes his own. <br />
This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand&#8217;ring guest; <br />
Her falt&#8217;ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. <br />
When day declines, and feasts renew the night, <br />
Still on his face she feeds her famish&#8217;d sight; <br />
She longs again to hear the prince relate <br />
His own adventures and the Trojan fate. <br />
He tells it o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er; but still in vain, <br />
For still she begs to hear it once again. <br />
The hearer on the speaker&#8217;s mouth depends, <br />
And thus the tragic story never ends. <br />
Then, when they part, when Phoebe&#8217;s paler light <br />
Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, <br />
She last remains, when ev&#8217;ry guest is gone, <br />
Sits on the bed he press&#8217;d, and sighs alone; <br />
Absent, her absent hero sees and hears; <br />
Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears, <br />
And seeks the father&#8217;s image in the child, <br />
If love by likeness might be so beguil&#8217;d. <br />
Meantime the rising tow&#8217;rs are at a stand; <br />
No labors exercise the youthful band, <br />
Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; <br />
The mole is left unfinish&#8217;d to the foe; <br />
The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, <br />
Short of their promis&#8217;d heighth, that seem&#8217;d to threat the sky, <br />
But when imperial Juno, from above, <br />
Saw Dido fetter&#8217;d in the chains of love, <br />
Hot with the venom which her veins inflam&#8217;d, <br />
And by no sense of shame to be reclaim&#8217;d, <br />
With soothing words to Venus she begun: <br />
&#8220;High praises, endless honors, you have won, <br />
And mighty trophies, with your worthy son! <br />
Two gods a silly woman have undone! <br />
Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect <br />
This rising city, which my hands erect: <br />
But shall celestial discord never cease? <br />
&#8216;T is better ended in a lasting peace. <br />
You stand possess&#8217;d of all your soul desir&#8217;d: <br />
Poor Dido with consuming love is fir&#8217;d. <br />
Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; <br />
So Dido shall be yours, AEneas mine: <br />
One common kingdom, one united line. <br />
Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, <br />
And lofty Carthage for a dow&#8217;r convey.&#8221; <br />
Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, <br />
Which would the scepter of the world misguide <br />
To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: <br />
&#8220;Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, <br />
And such alliance and such gifts refuse, <br />
If Fortune with our joint desires comply? <br />
The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; <br />
Lest he forbid, with absolute command, <br />
To mix the people in one common land&#8211; <br />
Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line <br />
In lasting leagues and sure succession join? <br />
But you, the partner of his bed and throne, <br />
May move his mind; my wishes are your own.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Mine,&#8221; said imperial Juno, &#8220;be the care; <br />
Time urges, now, to perfect this affair: <br />
Attend my counsel, and the secret share. <br />
When next the Sun his rising light displays, <br />
And gilds the world below with purple rays, <br />
The queen, AEneas, and the Tyrian court <br />
Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. <br />
There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, <br />
And cheerful horns from side to side resound, <br />
A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain <br />
With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; <br />
The fearful train shall take their speedy flight, <br />
Dispers&#8217;d, and all involv&#8217;d in gloomy night; <br />
One cave a grateful shelter shall afford <br />
To the fair princess and the Trojan lord. <br />
I will myself the bridal bed prepare, <br />
If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: <br />
So shall their loves be crown&#8217;d with due delights, <br />
And Hymen shall be present at the rites.&#8221; <br />
The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles <br />
At her vain project, and discover&#8217;d wiles. <br />
The rosy morn was risen from the main, <br />
And horns and hounds awake the princely train: <br />
They issue early thro&#8217; the city gate, <br />
Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, <br />
With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force <br />
Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. <br />
The Tyrian peers and officers of state <br />
For the slow queen in antechambers wait; <br />
Her lofty courser, in the court below, <br />
Who his majestic rider seems to know, <br />
Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, <br />
And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. <br />
The queen at length appears; on either hand <br />
The brawny guards in martial order stand. <br />
A flow&#8217;r&#8217;d simar with golden fringe she wore, <br />
And at her back a golden quiver bore; <br />
Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, <br />
A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. <br />
Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, <br />
Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. <br />
But far above the rest in beauty shines <br />
The great AEneas, when the troop he joins; <br />
Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost <br />
Of wint&#8217;ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, <br />
When to his native Delos he resorts, <br />
Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; <br />
Where painted Scythians, mix&#8217;d with Cretan bands, <br />
Before the joyful altars join their hands: <br />
Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below <br />
The merry madness of the sacred show. <br />
Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; <br />
A golden fillet binds his awful brows; <br />
His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen <br />
In manly presence, or in lofty mien. <br />
Now had they reach&#8217;d the hills, and storm&#8217;d the seat <br />
Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. <br />
The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound <br />
From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground; <br />
Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, <br />
In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, <br />
And a long chase in open view maintain. <br />
The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides, <br />
Spurs thro&#8217; the vale, and these and those outrides. <br />
His horse&#8217;s flanks and sides are forc&#8217;d to feel <br />
The clanking lash, and goring of the steel. <br />
Impatiently he views the feeble prey, <br />
Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way, <br />
And rather would the tusky boar attend, <br />
Or see the tawny lion downward bend. <br />
Meantime, the gath&#8217;ring clouds obscure the skies: <br />
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; <br />
The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours <br />
A wintry deluge down, and sounding show&#8217;rs. <br />
The company, dispers&#8217;d, to converts ride, <br />
And seek the homely cots, or mountain&#8217;s hollow side. <br />
The rapid rains, descending from the hills, <br />
To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. <br />
The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides, <br />
One common cavern in her bosom hides. <br />
Then first the trembling earth the signal gave, <br />
And flashing fires enlighten all the cave; <br />
Hell from below, and Juno from above, <br />
And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love. <br />
From this ill-omen&#8217;d hour in time arose <br />
Debate and death, and all succeeding woes. <br />
The queen, whom sense of honor could not move, <br />
No longer made a secret of her love, <br />
But call&#8217;d it marriage, by that specious name <br />
To veil the crime and sanctify the shame. <br />
The loud report thro&#8217; Libyan cities goes. <br />
Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows: <br />
Swift from the first; and ev&#8217;ry moment brings <br />
New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings. <br />
Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; <br />
Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. <br />
Inrag&#8217;d against the gods, revengeful Earth <br />
Produc&#8217;d her last of the Titanian birth. <br />
Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: <br />
A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. <br />
As many plumes as raise her lofty flight, <br />
So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight; <br />
Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry mouth is furnish&#8217;d with a tongue, <br />
And round with list&#8217;ning ears the flying plague is hung. <br />
She fills the peaceful universe with cries; <br />
No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes; <br />
By day, from lofty tow&#8217;rs her head she shews, <br />
And spreads thro&#8217; trembling crowds disastrous news; <br />
With court informers haunts, and royal spies; <br />
Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies. <br />
Talk is her business, and her chief delight <br />
To tell of prodigies and cause affright. <br />
She fills the people&#8217;s ears with Dido&#8217;s name, <br />
Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame, <br />
Admits into her throne and nuptial bed <br />
A wand&#8217;ring guest, who from his country fled: <br />
Whole days with him she passes in delights, <br />
And wastes in luxury long winter nights, <br />
Forgetful of her fame and royal trust, <br />
Dissolv&#8217;d in ease, abandon&#8217;d to her lust. <br />
The goddess widely spreads the loud report, <br />
And flies at length to King Hyarba&#8217;s court. <br />
When first possess&#8217;d with this unwelcome news <br />
Whom did he not of men and gods accuse? <br />
This prince, from ravish&#8217;d Garamantis born, <br />
A hundred temples did with spoils adorn, <br />
In Ammon&#8217;s honor, his celestial sire; <br />
A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire; <br />
And, thro&#8217; his vast dominions, priests ordain&#8217;d, <br />
Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain&#8217;d. <br />
The gates and columns were with garlands crown&#8217;d, <br />
And blood of victim beasts enrich&#8217;d the ground. <br />
He, when he heard a fugitive could move <br />
The Tyrian princess, who disdain&#8217;d his love, <br />
His breast with fury burn&#8217;d, his eyes with fire, <br />
Mad with despair, impatient with desire; <br />
Then on the sacred altars pouring wine, <br />
He thus with pray&#8217;rs implor&#8217;d his sire divine: <br />
&#8220;Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race, <br />
Who feast on painted beds, with off&#8217;rings grace <br />
Thy temples, and adore thy pow&#8217;r divine <br />
With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine, <br />
Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain <br />
Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? <br />
Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance? <br />
Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance? <br />
A wand&#8217;ring woman builds, within our state, <br />
A little town, bought at an easy rate; <br />
She pays me homage, and my grants allow <br />
A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow; <br />
Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led, <br />
Admits a banish&#8217;d Trojan to her bed! <br />
And now this other Paris, with his train <br />
Of conquer&#8217;d cowards, must in Afric reign! <br />
(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, <br />
Their locks with oil perfum&#8217;d, their Lydian dress.) <br />
He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; <br />
And I, rejected I, adore an empty name.&#8221; <br />
His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr&#8217;d, <br />
And held his altar&#8217;s horns. The mighty Thund&#8217;rer heard; <br />
Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found <br />
The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown&#8217;d, <br />
Lost in their loves, insensible of shame, <br />
And both forgetful of their better fame. <br />
He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends, <br />
By whom his menacing command he sends: <br />
&#8220;Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; <br />
Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly: <br />
There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days <br />
In slothful riot and inglorious ease, <br />
Nor minds the future city, giv&#8217;n by fate. <br />
To him this message from my mouth relate: <br />
&#8216;Not so fair Venus hop&#8217;d, when twice she won <br />
Thy life with pray&#8217;rs, nor promis&#8217;d such a son. <br />
Hers was a hero, destin&#8217;d to command <br />
A martial race, and rule the Latian land, <br />
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, <br />
And on the conquer&#8217;d world impose the law.&#8217; <br />
If glory cannot move a mind so mean, <br />
Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean, <br />
Yet why should he defraud his son of fame, <br />
And grudge the Romans their immortal name! <br />
What are his vain designs! what hopes he more <br />
From his long ling&#8217;ring on a hostile shore, <br />
Regardless to redeem his honor lost, <br />
And for his race to gain th&#8217; Ausonian coast! <br />
Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake; <br />
With this command the slumb&#8217;ring warrior wake.&#8221; <br />
Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds <br />
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds: <br />
And, whether o&#8217;er the seas or earth he flies, <br />
With rapid force they bear him down the skies. <br />
But first he grasps within his awful hand <br />
The mark of sov&#8217;reign pow&#8217;r, his magic wand; <br />
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; <br />
With this he drives them down the Stygian waves; <br />
With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, <br />
And eyes, tho&#8217; clos&#8217;d in death, restores to light. <br />
Thus arm&#8217;d, the god begins his airy race, <br />
And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; <br />
Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies, <br />
Whose brawny back supports the starry skies; <br />
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown&#8217;d, <br />
Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound. <br />
Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin <br />
The founts of rolling streams their race begin; <br />
A beard of ice on his large breast depends. <br />
Here, pois&#8217;d upon his wings, the god descends: <br />
Then, rested thus, he from the tow&#8217;ring height <br />
Plung&#8217;d downward, with precipitated flight, <br />
Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood. <br />
As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food, <br />
Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show; <br />
By turns they dance aloft, and dive below: <br />
Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies, <br />
And near the surface of the water flies, <br />
Till, having pass&#8217;d the seas, and cross&#8217;d the sands, <br />
He clos&#8217;d his wings, and stoop&#8217;d on Libyan lands: <br />
Where shepherds once were hous&#8217;d in homely sheds, <br />
Now tow&#8217;rs within the clouds advance their heads. <br />
Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince <br />
New ramparts raising for the town&#8217;s defense. <br />
A purple scarf, with gold embroider&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
(Queen Dido&#8217;s gift,) about his waist he wore; <br />
A sword, with glitt&#8217;ring gems diversified, <br />
For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. <br />
Then thus, with winged words, the god began, <br />
Resuming his own shape: &#8220;Degenerate man, <br />
Thou woman&#8217;s property, what mak&#8217;st thou here, <br />
These foreign walls and Tyrian tow&#8217;rs to rear, <br />
Forgetful of thy own? All-pow&#8217;rful Jove, <br />
Who sways the world below and heav&#8217;n above, <br />
Has sent me down with this severe command: <br />
What means thy ling&#8217;ring in the Libyan land? <br />
If glory cannot move a mind so mean, <br />
Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean, <br />
Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir: <br />
The promis&#8217;d crown let young Ascanius wear, <br />
To whom th&#8217; Ausonian scepter, and the state <br />
Of Rome&#8217;s imperial name is ow&#8217;d by fate.&#8221; <br />
So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, <br />
Involv&#8217;d in clouds, and vanish&#8217;d out of sight. <br />
The pious prince was seiz&#8217;d with sudden fear; <br />
Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. <br />
Revolving in his mind the stern command, <br />
He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. <br />
What should he say? or how should he begin? <br />
What course, alas! remains to steer between <br />
Th&#8217; offended lover and the pow&#8217;rful queen? <br />
This way and that he turns his anxious mind, <br />
And all expedients tries, and none can find. <br />
Fix&#8217;d on the deed, but doubtful of the means, <br />
After long thought, to this advice he leans: <br />
Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair <br />
The fleet, and ship their men with silent care; <br />
Some plausible pretense he bids them find, <br />
To color what in secret he design&#8217;d. <br />
Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, <br />
Before the love-sick lady heard the news; <br />
And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, <br />
To suffer what the sov&#8217;reign pow&#8217;r decrees: <br />
Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. <br />
They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. <br />
But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: <br />
(What arts can blind a jealous woman&#8217;s eyes!) <br />
She was the first to find the secret fraud, <br />
Before the fatal news was blaz&#8217;d abroad. <br />
Love the first motions of the lover hears, <br />
Quick to presage, and ev&#8217;n in safety fears. <br />
Nor impious Fame was wanting to report <br />
The ships repair&#8217;d, the Trojans&#8217; thick resort, <br />
And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. <br />
Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound, <br />
And impotent of mind, she roves the city round. <br />
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, <br />
When, from afar, their nightly god they hear, <br />
And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear <br />
At length she finds the dear perfidious man; <br />
Prevents his form&#8217;d excuse, and thus began: <br />
&#8220;Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, <br />
And undiscover&#8217;d scape a lover&#8217;s eye? <br />
Nor could my kindness your compassion move, <br />
Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love? <br />
Or is the death of a despairing queen <br />
Not worth preventing, tho&#8217; too well foreseen? <br />
Ev&#8217;n when the wintry winds command your stay, <br />
You dare the tempests, and defy the sea. <br />
False as you are, suppose you were not bound <br />
To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; <br />
Were Troy restor&#8217;d, and Priam&#8217;s happy reign, <br />
Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main? <br />
See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? <br />
Now, by those holy vows, so late begun, <br />
By this right hand, (since I have nothing more <br />
To challenge, but the faith you gave before;) <br />
I beg you by these tears too truly shed, <br />
By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed; <br />
If ever Dido, when you most were kind, <br />
Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch&#8217;d your mind; <br />
By these my pray&#8217;rs, if pray&#8217;rs may yet have place, <br />
Pity the fortunes of a falling race. <br />
For you I have provok&#8217;d a tyrant&#8217;s hate, <br />
Incens&#8217;d the Libyan and the Tyrian state; <br />
For you alone I suffer in my fame, <br />
Bereft of honor, and expos&#8217;d to shame. <br />
Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? <br />
(That only name remains of all the rest!) <br />
What have I left? or whither can I fly? <br />
Must I attend Pygmalion&#8217;s cruelty, <br />
Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead <br />
A queen that proudly scorn&#8217;d his proffer&#8217;d bed? <br />
Had you deferr&#8217;d, at least, your hasty flight, <br />
And left behind some pledge of our delight, <br />
Some babe to bless the mother&#8217;s mournful sight, <br />
Some young AEneas, to supply your place, <br />
Whose features might express his father&#8217;s face; <br />
I should not then complain to live bereft <br />
Of all my husband, or be wholly left.&#8221; <br />
Here paus&#8217;d the queen. Unmov&#8217;d he holds his eyes, <br />
By Jove&#8217;s command; nor suffer&#8217;d love to rise, <br />
Tho&#8217; heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies: <br />
&#8220;Fair queen, you never can enough repeat <br />
Your boundless favors, or I own my debt; <br />
Nor can my mind forget Eliza&#8217;s name, <br />
While vital breath inspires this mortal frame. <br />
This only let me speak in my defense: <br />
I never hop&#8217;d a secret flight from hence, <br />
Much less pretended to the lawful claim <br />
Of sacred nuptials, or a husband&#8217;s name. <br />
For, if indulgent Heav&#8217;n would leave me free, <br />
And not submit my life to fate&#8217;s decree, <br />
My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore, <br />
Those relics to review, their dust adore, <br />
And Priam&#8217;s ruin&#8217;d palace to restore. <br />
But now the Delphian oracle commands, <br />
And fate invites me to the Latian lands. <br />
That is the promis&#8217;d place to which I steer, <br />
And all my vows are terminated there. <br />
If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born, <br />
With walls and tow&#8217;rs a Libyan town adorn, <br />
Why may not we&#8211;like you, a foreign race&#8211; <br />
Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place? <br />
As often as the night obscures the skies <br />
With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, <br />
Anchises&#8217; angry ghost in dreams appears, <br />
Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears; <br />
And young Ascanius justly may complain <br />
Of his defrauded fate and destin&#8217;d reign. <br />
Ev&#8217;n now the herald of the gods appear&#8217;d: <br />
Waking I saw him, and his message heard. <br />
From Jove he came commission&#8217;d, heav&#8217;nly bright <br />
With radiant beams, and manifest to sight <br />
(The sender and the sent I both attest): <br />
These walls he enter&#8217;d, and those words express&#8217;d. <br />
Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command; <br />
Forc&#8217;d by my fate, I leave your happy land.&#8221; <br />
Thus while he spoke, already she began, <br />
With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man; <br />
From head to foot survey&#8217;d his person o&#8217;er, <br />
Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore: <br />
&#8220;False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn! <br />
Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, <br />
But hewn from harden&#8217;d entrails of a rock! <br />
And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! <br />
Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear? <br />
Did he once look, or lent a list&#8217;ning ear, <br />
Sigh&#8217;d when I sobb&#8217;d, or shed one kindly tear?&#8211; <br />
All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, <br />
So foul, that, which is worse, &#8217;tis hard to find. <br />
Of man&#8217;s injustice why should I complain? <br />
The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain <br />
Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, <br />
Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; <br />
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! <br />
Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more! <br />
I sav&#8217;d the shipwrack&#8217;d exile on my shore; <br />
With needful food his hungry Trojans fed; <br />
I took the traitor to my throne and bed: <br />
Fool that I was&#8211;&#8217;t is little to repeat <br />
The rest&#8211;I stor&#8217;d and rigg&#8217;d his ruin&#8217;d fleet. <br />
I rave, I rave! A god&#8217;s command he pleads, <br />
And makes Heav&#8217;n accessary to his deeds. <br />
Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, <br />
Now Hermes is employ&#8217;d from Jove&#8217;s abode, <br />
To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state <br />
Of heav&#8217;nly pow&#8217;rs were touch&#8217;d with human fate! <br />
But go! thy flight no longer I detain&#8211; <br />
Go seek thy promis&#8217;d kingdom thro&#8217; the main! <br />
Yet, if the heav&#8217;ns will hear my pious vow, <br />
The faithless waves, not half so false as thou, <br />
Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford <br />
To thy proud vessels, and their perjur&#8217;d lord. <br />
Then shalt thou call on injur&#8217;d Dido&#8217;s name: <br />
Dido shall come in a black sulph&#8217;ry flame, <br />
When death has once dissolv&#8217;d her mortal frame; <br />
Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: <br />
Her angry ghost, arising from the deep, <br />
Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep. <br />
At least my shade thy punishment shall know, <br />
And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.&#8221; <br />
Abruptly here she stops; then turns away <br />
Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d he stood, revolving in his mind <br />
What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. <br />
Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, <br />
And softly laid her on her iv&#8217;ry bed. <br />
But good AEneas, tho&#8217; he much desir&#8217;d <br />
To give that pity which her grief requir&#8217;d; <br />
Tho&#8217; much he mourn&#8217;d, and labor&#8217;d with his love, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d at length, obeys the will of Jove; <br />
Reviews his forces: they with early care <br />
Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. <br />
The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, <br />
And well-calk&#8217;d galleys in the harbor ride. <br />
Then oaks for oars they fell&#8217;d; or, as they stood, <br />
Of its green arms despoil&#8217;d the growing wood, <br />
Studious of flight. The beach is cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er <br />
With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: <br />
On ev&#8217;ry side are seen, descending down, <br />
Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. <br />
Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, <br />
Fearful of winter, and of future wants, <br />
T&#8217; invade the corn, and to their cells convey <br />
The plunder&#8217;d forage of their yellow prey. <br />
The sable troops, along the narrow tracks, <br />
Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: <br />
Some set their shoulders to the pond&#8217;rous grain; <br />
Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; <br />
All ply their sev&#8217;ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. <br />
What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, <br />
When, from the tow&#8217;r, she saw the cover&#8217;d shore, <br />
And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with the murmurs of the wat&#8217;ry war! <br />
All-pow&#8217;rful Love! what changes canst thou cause <br />
In human hearts, subjected to thy laws! <br />
Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends: <br />
To pray&#8217;rs and mean submissions she descends. <br />
No female arts or aids she left untried, <br />
Nor counsels unexplor&#8217;d, before she died. <br />
&#8220;Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea; <br />
They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh. <br />
The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, <br />
Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind. <br />
Could I have thought this threat&#8217;ning blow so near, <br />
My tender soul had been forewarn&#8217;d to bear. <br />
But do not you my last request deny; <br />
With yon perfidious man your int&#8217;rest try, <br />
And bring me news, if I must live or die. <br />
You are his fav&#8217;rite; you alone can find <br />
The dark recesses of his inmost mind: <br />
In all his trusted secrets you have part, <br />
And know the soft approaches to his heart. <br />
Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; <br />
Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go, <br />
Nor did my fleet against his friends employ, <br />
Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, <br />
Nor mov&#8217;d with hands profane his father&#8217;s dust: <br />
Why should he then reject a suit so just! <br />
Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly! <br />
Can he this last, this only pray&#8217;r deny! <br />
Let him at least his dang&#8217;rous flight delay, <br />
Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea. <br />
The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more: <br />
Let him pursue the promis&#8217;d Latian shore. <br />
A short delay is all I ask him now; <br />
A pause of grief, an interval from woe, <br />
Till my soft soul be temper&#8217;d to sustain <br />
Accustom&#8217;d sorrows, and inur&#8217;d to pain. <br />
If you in pity grant this one request, <br />
My death shall glut the hatred of his breast.&#8221; <br />
This mournful message pious Anna bears, <br />
And seconds with her own her sister&#8217;s tears: <br />
But all her arts are still employ&#8217;d in vain; <br />
Again she comes, and is refus&#8217;d again. <br />
His harden&#8217;d heart nor pray&#8217;rs nor threat&#8217;nings move; <br />
Fate, and the god, had stopp&#8217;d his ears to love. <br />
As, when the winds their airy quarrel try, <br />
Justling from ev&#8217;ry quarter of the sky, <br />
This way and that the mountain oak they bend, <br />
His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend; <br />
With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; <br />
The hollow valleys echo to the sound: <br />
Unmov&#8217;d, the royal plant their fury mocks, <br />
Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; <br />
Far as he shoots his tow&#8217;ring head on high, <br />
So deep in earth his fix&#8217;d foundations lie. <br />
No less a storm the Trojan hero bears; <br />
Thick messages and loud complaints he hears, <br />
And bandied words, still beating on his ears. <br />
Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains; <br />
But the firm purpose of his heart remains. <br />
The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate, <br />
Begins at length the light of heav&#8217;n to hate, <br />
And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees, <br />
To hasten on the death her soul decrees: <br />
Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine, <br />
She pours in sacrifice the purple wine, <br />
The purple wine is turn&#8217;d to putrid blood, <br />
And the white offer&#8217;d milk converts to mud. <br />
This dire presage, to her alone reveal&#8217;d, <br />
From all, and ev&#8217;n her sister, she conceal&#8217;d. <br />
A marble temple stood within the grove, <br />
Sacred to death, and to her murther&#8217;d love; <br />
That honor&#8217;d chapel she had hung around <br />
With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown&#8217;d: <br />
Oft, when she visited this lonely dome, <br />
Strange voices issued from her husband&#8217;s tomb; <br />
She thought she heard him summon her away, <br />
Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay. <br />
Hourly &#8216;t is heard, when with a boding note <br />
The solitary screech owl strains her throat, <br />
And, on a chimney&#8217;s top, or turret&#8217;s height, <br />
With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night. <br />
Besides, old prophecies augment her fears; <br />
And stern AEneas in her dreams appears, <br />
Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone, <br />
To wander in her sleep, thro&#8217; ways unknown, <br />
Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain, <br />
To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain: <br />
Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear, <br />
He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear; <br />
Or mad Orestes, when his mother&#8217;s ghost <br />
Full in his face infernal torches toss&#8217;d, <br />
And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, <br />
Flies o&#8217;er the stage, surpris&#8217;d with mortal fright; <br />
The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight. <br />
Now, sinking underneath a load of grief, <br />
From death alone she seeks her last relief; <br />
The time and means resolv&#8217;d within her breast, <br />
She to her mournful sister thus address&#8217;d <br />
(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears, <br />
And a false vigor in her eyes appears): <br />
&#8220;Rejoice!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Instructed from above, <br />
My lover I shall gain, or lose my love. <br />
Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun, <br />
Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run: <br />
There a Massylian priestess I have found, <br />
Honor&#8217;d for age, for magic arts renown&#8217;d: <br />
Th&#8217; Hesperian temple was her trusted care; <br />
&#8216;T was she supplied the wakeful dragon&#8217;s fare. <br />
She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, <br />
Reclaim&#8217;d his rage, and sooth&#8217;d him into sleep. <br />
She watch&#8217;d the golden fruit; her charms unbind <br />
The chains of love, or fix them on the mind: <br />
She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, <br />
Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky. <br />
The yawning earth rebellows to her call, <br />
Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. <br />
Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, <br />
How loth I am to try this impious art! <br />
Within the secret court, with silent care, <br />
Erect a lofty pile, expos&#8217;d in air: <br />
Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, <br />
Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest. <br />
Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac&#8217;d, <br />
Where I my ruin in his arms embrac&#8217;d: <br />
All relics of the wretch are doom&#8217;d to fire; <br />
For so the priestess and her charms require.&#8221; <br />
Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears; <br />
A mortal paleness in her face appears: <br />
Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find <br />
The secret fun&#8217;ral in these rites design&#8217;d; <br />
Nor thought so dire a rage possess&#8217;d her mind. <br />
Unknowing of a train conceal&#8217;d so well, <br />
She fear&#8217;d no worse than when Sichaeus fell; <br />
Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear, <br />
Within the secret court, expos&#8217;d in air. <br />
The cloven holms and pines are heap&#8217;d on high, <br />
And garlands on the hollow spaces lie. <br />
Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry baleful green denoting death. <br />
The queen, determin&#8217;d to the fatal deed, <br />
The spoils and sword he left, in order spread, <br />
And the man&#8217;s image on the nuptial bed. <br />
And now (the sacred altars plac&#8217;d around) <br />
The priestess enters, with her hair unbound, <br />
And thrice invokes the pow&#8217;rs below the ground. <br />
Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims, <br />
And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names, <br />
And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round <br />
With feign&#8217;d Avernian drops the hallow&#8217;d ground; <br />
Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe&#8217;s light, <br />
With brazen sickles reap&#8217;d at noon of night; <br />
Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl, <br />
And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal, <br />
Robbing the mother&#8217;s love. The destin&#8217;d queen <br />
Observes, assisting at the rites obscene; <br />
A leaven&#8217;d cake in her devoted hands <br />
She holds, and next the highest altar stands: <br />
One tender foot was shod, her other bare; <br />
Girt was her gather&#8217;d gown, and loose her hair. <br />
Thus dress&#8217;d, she summon&#8217;d, with her dying breath, <br />
The heav&#8217;ns and planets conscious of her death, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry pow&#8217;r, if any rules above, <br />
Who minds, or who revenges, injur&#8217;d love. <br />
&#8216;T was dead of night, when weary bodies close <br />
Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose: <br />
The winds no longer whisper thro&#8217; the woods, <br />
Nor murm&#8217;ring tides disturb the gentle floods. <br />
The stars in silent order mov&#8217;d around; <br />
And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground. <br />
The flocks and herds, and party-color&#8217;d fowl, <br />
Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool, <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on the quiet earth, securely lay, <br />
Forgetting the past labors of the day. <br />
All else of nature&#8217;s common gift partake: <br />
Unhappy Dido was alone awake. <br />
Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; <br />
Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind. <br />
Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart; <br />
Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part. <br />
Then thus she said within her secret mind: <br />
&#8220;What shall I do? what succor can I find? <br />
Become a suppliant to Hyarba&#8217;s pride, <br />
And take my turn, to court and be denied? <br />
Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go, <br />
Forsake an empire, and attend a foe? <br />
Himself I refug&#8217;d, and his train reliev&#8217;d&#8211; <br />
&#8216;T is true&#8211;but am I sure to be receiv&#8217;d? <br />
Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place! <br />
Laomedon still lives in all his race! <br />
Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew, <br />
Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue? <br />
What force have I but those whom scarce before <br />
I drew reluctant from their native shore? <br />
Will they again embark at my desire, <br />
Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre? <br />
Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade, <br />
And take the fortune thou thyself hast made. <br />
Your pity, sister, first seduc&#8217;d my mind, <br />
Or seconded too well what I design&#8217;d. <br />
These dear-bought pleasures had I never known, <br />
Had I continued free, and still my own; <br />
Avoiding love, I had not found despair, <br />
But shar&#8217;d with salvage beasts the common air. <br />
Like them, a lonely life I might have led, <br />
Not mourn&#8217;d the living, nor disturb&#8217;d the dead.&#8221; <br />
These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast. <br />
On board, the Trojan found more easy rest. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to sail, in sleep he pass&#8217;d the night; <br />
And order&#8217;d all things for his early flight. <br />
To whom once more the winged god appears; <br />
His former youthful mien and shape he wears, <br />
And with this new alarm invades his ears: <br />
&#8220;Sleep&#8217;st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown <br />
Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town, <br />
Beset with foes; nor hear&#8217;st the western gales <br />
Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? <br />
She harbors in her heart a furious hate, <br />
And thou shalt find the dire effects too late; <br />
Fix&#8217;d on revenge, and obstinate to die. <br />
Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow&#8217;r to fly. <br />
The sea with ships will soon be cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. <br />
Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies, <br />
And sail before the purple morn arise. <br />
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring? <br />
Woman &#8216;s a various and a changeful thing.&#8221; <br />
Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight <br />
Aloft in air unseen, and mix&#8217;d with night. <br />
Twice warn&#8217;d by the celestial messenger, <br />
The pious prince arose with hasty fear; <br />
Then rous&#8217;d his drowsy train without delay: <br />
&#8220;Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, <br />
And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. <br />
A god commands: he stood before my sight, <br />
And urg&#8217;d us once again to speedy flight. <br />
O sacred pow&#8217;r, what pow&#8217;r soe&#8217;er thou art, <br />
To thy blest orders I resign my heart. <br />
Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands, <br />
And prosper the design thy will commands.&#8221; <br />
He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword, <br />
His thund&#8217;ring arm divides the many-twisted cord. <br />
An emulating zeal inspires his train: <br />
They run; they snatch; they rush into the main. <br />
With headlong haste they leave the desert shores, <br />
And brush the liquid seas with lab&#8217;ring oars. <br />
Aurora now had left her saffron bed, <br />
And beams of early light the heav&#8217;ns o&#8217;erspread, <br />
When, from a tow&#8217;r, the queen, with wakeful eyes, <br />
Saw day point upward from the rosy skies. <br />
She look&#8217;d to seaward; but the sea was void, <br />
And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. <br />
Stung with despite, and furious with despair, <br />
She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair. <br />
&#8220;And shall th&#8217; ungrateful traitor go,&#8221; she said, <br />
&#8220;My land forsaken, and my love betray&#8217;d? <br />
Shall we not arm? not rush from ev&#8217;ry street, <br />
To follow, sink, and burn his perjur&#8217;d fleet? <br />
Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe! <br />
Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row! <br />
What have I said? where am I? Fury turns <br />
My brain; and my distemper&#8217;d bosom burns. <br />
Then, when I gave my person and my throne, <br />
This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown. <br />
See now the promis&#8217;d faith, the vaunted name, <br />
The pious man, who, rushing thro&#8217; the flame, <br />
Preserv&#8217;d his gods, and to the Phrygian shore <br />
The burthen of his feeble father bore! <br />
I should have torn him piecemeal; strow&#8217;d in floods <br />
His scatter&#8217;d limbs, or left expos&#8217;d in woods; <br />
Destroy&#8217;d his friends and son; and, from the fire, <br />
Have set the reeking boy before the sire. <br />
Events are doubtful, which on battles wait: <br />
Yet where&#8217;s the doubt, to souls secure of fate? <br />
My Tyrians, at their injur&#8217;d queen&#8217;s command, <br />
Had toss&#8217;d their fires amid the Trojan band; <br />
At once extinguish&#8217;d all the faithless name; <br />
And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, <br />
Had fall&#8217;n upon the pile, to mend the fun&#8217;ral flame. <br />
Thou Sun, who view&#8217;st at once the world below; <br />
Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; <br />
Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes! <br />
Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods, <br />
All pow&#8217;rs invok&#8217;d with Dido&#8217;s dying breath, <br />
Attend her curses and avenge her death! <br />
If so the Fates ordain, and Jove commands, <br />
Th&#8217; ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands, <br />
Yet let a race untam&#8217;d, and haughty foes, <br />
His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose: <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with numbers in th&#8217; unequal field, <br />
His men discourag&#8217;d, and himself expell&#8217;d, <br />
Let him for succor sue from place to place, <br />
Torn from his subjects, and his son&#8217;s embrace. <br />
First, let him see his friends in battle slain, <br />
And their untimely fate lament in vain; <br />
And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease, <br />
On hard conditions may he buy his peace: <br />
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; <br />
But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand, <br />
And lie unburied on the barren sand! <br />
These are my pray&#8217;rs, and this my dying will; <br />
And you, my Tyrians, ev&#8217;ry curse fulfil. <br />
Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim, <br />
Against the prince, the people, and the name. <br />
These grateful off&#8217;rings on my grave bestow; <br />
Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know! <br />
Now, and from hence, in ev&#8217;ry future age, <br />
When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage, <br />
Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood, <br />
With fire and sword pursue the perjur&#8217;d brood; <br />
Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos&#8217;d to theirs; <br />
And the same hate descend on all our heirs!&#8221; <br />
This said, within her anxious mind she weighs <br />
The means of cutting short her odious days. <br />
Then to Sichaeus&#8217; nurse she briefly said <br />
(For, when she left her country, hers was dead): <br />
&#8220;Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care <br />
The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare; <br />
The sheep, and all th&#8217; atoning off&#8217;rings, bring, <br />
Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring <br />
With living drops; then let her come, and thou <br />
With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow. <br />
Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove, <br />
And end the cares of my disastrous love; <br />
Then cast the Trojan image on the fire, <br />
And, as that burns, my passions shall expire.&#8221; <br />
The nurse moves onward, with officious care, <br />
And all the speed her aged limbs can bear. <br />
But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv&#8217;d, <br />
Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv&#8217;d. <br />
With livid spots distinguish&#8217;d was her face; <br />
Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos&#8217;d her pace; <br />
Ghastly she gaz&#8217;d, with pain she drew her breath, <br />
And nature shiver&#8217;d at approaching death. <br />
Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass&#8217;d, <br />
And mounts the fun&#8217;ral pile with furious haste; <br />
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind <br />
(Not for so dire an enterprise design&#8217;d). <br />
But when she view&#8217;d the garments loosely spread, <br />
Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed, <br />
She paus&#8217;d, and with a sigh the robes embrac&#8217;d; <br />
Then on the couch her trembling body cast, <br />
Repress&#8217;d the ready tears, and spoke her last: <br />
&#8220;Dear pledges of my love, while Heav&#8217;n so pleas&#8217;d, <br />
Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas&#8217;d: <br />
My fatal course is finish&#8217;d; and I go, <br />
A glorious name, among the ghosts below. <br />
A lofty city by my hands is rais&#8217;d, <br />
Pygmalion punish&#8217;d, and my lord appeas&#8217;d. <br />
What could my fortune have afforded more, <br />
Had the false Trojan never touch&#8217;d my shore!&#8221; <br />
Then kiss&#8217;d the couch; and, &#8220;Must I die,&#8221; she said, <br />
&#8220;And unreveng&#8217;d? &#8216;T is doubly to be dead! <br />
Yet ev&#8217;n this death with pleasure I receive: <br />
On any terms, &#8216;t is better than to live. <br />
These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view; <br />
These boding omens his base flight pursue!&#8221; <br />
She said, and struck; deep enter&#8217;d in her side <br />
The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: <br />
Clogg&#8217;d in the wound the cruel weapon stands; <br />
The spouting blood came streaming on her hands. <br />
Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke, <br />
And with loud cries the sounding palace shook. <br />
Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled, <br />
And thro&#8217; the town the dismal rumor spread. <br />
First from the frighted court the yell began; <br />
Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran: <br />
The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries <br />
Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies. <br />
Not less the clamor, than if&#8211;ancient Tyre, <br />
Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire&#8211; <br />
The rolling ruin, with their lov&#8217;d abodes, <br />
Involv&#8217;d the blazing temples of their gods. <br />
Her sister hears; and, furious with despair, <br />
She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, <br />
And, calling on Eliza&#8217;s name aloud, <br />
Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. <br />
&#8220;Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar&#8217;d; <br />
These fires, this fun&#8217;ral pile, these altars rear&#8217;d? <br />
Was all this train of plots contriv&#8217;d,&#8221; said she, <br />
&#8220;All only to deceive unhappy me? <br />
Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend <br />
To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? <br />
Thy summon&#8217;d sister, and thy friend, had come; <br />
One sword had serv&#8217;d us both, one common tomb: <br />
Was I to raise the pile, the pow&#8217;rs invoke, <br />
Not to be present at the fatal stroke? <br />
At once thou hast destroy&#8217;d thyself and me, <br />
Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! <br />
Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death <br />
Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.&#8221; <br />
This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, <br />
And in her arms the gasping queen embrac&#8217;d; <br />
Her temples chaf&#8217;d; and her own garments tore, <br />
To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. <br />
Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head, <br />
And, fainting thrice, fell grov&#8217;ling on the bed; <br />
Thrice op&#8217;d her heavy eyes, and sought the light, <br />
But, having found it, sicken&#8217;d at the sight, <br />
And clos&#8217;d her lids at last in endless night. <br />
Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain <br />
A death so ling&#8217;ring, and so full of pain, <br />
Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife <br />
Of lab&#8217;ring nature, and dissolve her life. <br />
For since she died, not doom&#8217;d by Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s decree, <br />
Or her own crime, but human casualty, <br />
And rage of love, that plung&#8217;d her in despair, <br />
The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, <br />
Which Proserpine and they can only know; <br />
Nor made her sacred to the shades below. <br />
Downward the various goddess took her flight, <br />
And drew a thousand colors from the light; <br />
Then stood above the dying lover&#8217;s head, <br />
And said: &#8220;I thus devote thee to the dead. <br />
This off&#8217;ring to th&#8217; infernal gods I bear.&#8221; <br />
Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: <br />
The struggling soul was loos&#8217;d, and life dissolv&#8217;d in air.</p>
