				<p>THE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE AENEIS </p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT.&#8211; Turnus challenges AEneas to a single combat:<br />
articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutili, who wound AEneas.<br />
He is miraculously cur&#8217;d by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and<br />
concludes the poem with his death.</p>
<p>WHEN Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, <br />
Their armies broken, and their courage quell&#8217;d, <br />
Himself become the mark of public spite, <br />
His honor question&#8217;d for the promis&#8217;d fight; <br />
The more he was with vulgar hate oppress&#8217;d, <br />
The more his fury boil&#8217;d within his breast: <br />
He rous&#8217;d his vigor for the last debate, <br />
And rais&#8217;d his haughty soul to meet his fate. <br />
As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, <br />
He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; <br />
But, if the pointed jav&#8217;lin pierce his side, <br />
The lordly beast returns with double pride: <br />
He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; <br />
His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: <br />
So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, <br />
Thro&#8217; his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. <br />
Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, <br />
At length approach&#8217;d the king, and thus began: <br />
&#8220;No more excuses or delays: I stand <br />
In arms prepar&#8217;d to combat, hand to hand, <br />
This base deserter of his native land. <br />
The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take <br />
The same conditions which himself did make. <br />
Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare, <br />
And to my single virtue trust the war. <br />
The Latians unconcern&#8217;d shall see the fight; <br />
This arm unaided shall assert your right: <br />
Then, if my prostrate body press the plain, <br />
To him the crown and beauteous bride remain.&#8221; <br />
To whom the king sedately thus replied: <br />
&#8220;Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried, <br />
The more becomes it us, with due respect, <br />
To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect. <br />
You want not wealth, or a successive throne, <br />
Or cities which your arms have made your own: <br />
My towns and treasures are at your command, <br />
And stor&#8217;d with blooming beauties is my land; <br />
Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees, <br />
Unmarried, fair, of noble families. <br />
Now let me speak, and you with patience hear, <br />
Things which perhaps may grate a lover&#8217;s ear, <br />
But sound advice, proceeding from a heart <br />
Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art. <br />
The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, <br />
No prince Italian born should heir my throne: <br />
Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill&#8217;d, <br />
And oft our priests, a foreign son reveal&#8217;d. <br />
Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood, <br />
Brib&#8217;d by my kindness to my kindred blood, <br />
Urg&#8217;d by my wife, who would not be denied, <br />
I promis&#8217;d my Lavinia for your bride: <br />
Her from her plighted lord by force I took; <br />
All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke: <br />
On your account I wag&#8217;d an impious war&#8211; <br />
With what success, &#8216;t is needless to declare; <br />
I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share. <br />
Twice vanquish&#8217;d while in bloody fields we strive, <br />
Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive: <br />
The rolling flood runs warm with human gore; <br />
The bones of Latians blanch the neighb&#8217;ring shore. <br />
Why put I not an end to this debate, <br />
Still unresolv&#8217;d, and still a slave to fate? <br />
If Turnus&#8217; death a lasting peace can give, <br />
Why should I not procure it whilst you live? <br />
Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray, <br />
What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say? <br />
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav&#8217;n defend!) <br />
How curse the cause which hasten&#8217;d to his end <br />
The daughter&#8217;s lover and the father&#8217;s friend? <br />
Weigh in your mind the various chance of war; <br />
Pity your parent&#8217;s age, and ease his care.&#8221; <br />
Such balmy words he pour&#8217;d, but all in vain: <br />
The proffer&#8217;d med&#8217;cine but provok&#8217;d the pain. <br />
The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, <br />
With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief: <br />
&#8220;The care, O best of fathers, which you take <br />
For my concerns, at my desire forsake. <br />
Permit me not to languish out my days, <br />
But make the best exchange of life for praise. <br />
This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; <br />
And the blood follows, where the weapon flies. <br />
His goddess mother is not near, to shroud <br />
The flying coward with an empty cloud.&#8221; <br />
But now the queen, who fear&#8217;d for Turnus&#8217; life, <br />
And loath&#8217;d the hard conditions of the strife, <br />
Held him by force; and, dying in his death, <br />
In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath: <br />
&#8220;O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears, <br />
And whate&#8217;er price Amata&#8217;s honor bears <br />
Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope, <br />
My sickly mind&#8217;s repose, my sinking age&#8217;s prop; <br />
Since on the safety of thy life alone <br />
Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne: <br />
Refuse me not this one, this only pray&#8217;r, <br />
To waive the combat, and pursue the war. <br />
Whatever chance attends this fatal strife, <br />
Think it includes, in thine, Amata&#8217;s life. <br />
I cannot live a slave, or see my throne <br />
Usurp&#8217;d by strangers or a Trojan son.&#8221; <br />
At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed; <br />
A crimson blush her beauteous face o&#8217;erspread, <br />
Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red. <br />
The driving colors, never at a stay, <br />
Run here and there, and flush, and fade away. <br />
Delightful change! Thus Indian iv&#8217;ry shows, <br />
Which with the bord&#8217;ring paint of purple glows; <br />
Or lilies damask&#8217;d by the neighb&#8217;ring rose. <br />
The lover gaz&#8217;d, and, burning with desire, <br />
The more he look&#8217;d, the more he fed the fire: <br />
Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite, <br />
Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight. <br />
Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes, <br />
Firm to his first intent, he thus replies: <br />
&#8220;O mother, do not by your tears prepare <br />
Such boding omens, and prejudge the war. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d on fight, I am no longer free <br />
To shun my death, if Heav&#8217;n my death decree.&#8221; <br />
Then turning to the herald, thus pursues: <br />
&#8220;Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news; <br />
Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow&#8217;s light <br />
Shall gild the heav&#8217;ns, he need not urge the fight; <br />
The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more <br />
Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore: <br />
Our single swords the quarrel shall decide, <br />
And to the victor be the beauteous bride.&#8221; <br />
He said, and striding on, with speedy pace, <br />
He sought his coursers of the Thracian race. <br />
At his approach they toss their heads on high, <br />
And, proudly neighing, promise victory. <br />
The sires of these Orythia sent from far, <br />
To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war. <br />
The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white, <br />
Nor northern winds in fleetness match&#8217;d their flight. <br />
Officious grooms stand ready by his side; <br />
And some with combs their flowing manes divide, <br />
And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride. <br />
He sheath&#8217;d his limbs in arms; a temper&#8217;d mass <br />
Of golden metal those, and mountain brass. <br />
Then to his head his glitt&#8217;ring helm he tied, <br />
And girt his faithful fauchion to his side. <br />
In his AEtnaean forge, the God of Fire <br />
That fauchion labor&#8217;d for the hero&#8217;s sire; <br />
Immortal keenness on the blade bestow&#8217;d, <br />
And plung&#8217;d it hissing in the Stygian flood. <br />
Propp&#8217;d on a pillar, which the ceiling bore, <br />
Was plac&#8217;d the lance Auruncan Actor wore; <br />
Which with such force he brandish&#8217;d in his hand, <br />
The tough ash trembled like an osier wand: <br />
Then cried: &#8220;O pond&#8217;rous spoil of Actor slain, <br />
And never yet by Turnus toss&#8217;d in vain, <br />
Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go, <br />
Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe! <br />
Give me to tear his corslet from his breast, <br />
And from that eunuch head to rend the crest; <br />
Dragg&#8217;d in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil, <br />
Hot from the vexing ir&#8217;n, and smear&#8217;d with fragrant oil!&#8221; <br />
Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies <br />
A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes. <br />
So fares the bull in his lov&#8217;d female&#8217;s sight: <br />
Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight; <br />
He tries his goring horns against a tree, <br />
And meditates his absent enemy; <br />
He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand <br />
With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. <br />
Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms, <br />
To future fight his manly courage warms: <br />
He whets his fury, and with joy prepares <br />
To terminate at once the ling&#8217;ring wars; <br />
To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates <br />
What Heav&#8217;n had promis&#8217;d, and expounds the fates. <br />
Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease <br />
The rage of arms, and ratify the peace. <br />
The morn ensuing, from the mountain&#8217;s height, <br />
Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light; <br />
Th&#8217; ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, <br />
From out their flaming nostrils breath&#8217;d the day; <br />
When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard, <br />
In friendly labor join&#8217;d, the list prepar&#8217;d. <br />
Beneath the walls they measure out the space; <br />
Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, <br />
Where, with religious rites, their common gods they place. <br />
In purest white the priests their heads attire; <br />
And living waters bear, and holy fire; <br />
And, o&#8217;er their linen hoods and shaded hair, <br />
Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear, <br />
In order issuing from the town appears <br />
The Latin legion, arm&#8217;d with pointed spears; <br />
And from the fields, advancing on a line, <br />
The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join: <br />
Their various arms afford a pleasing sight; <br />
A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar&#8217;d for fight. <br />
Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, <br />
Glitt&#8217;ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; <br />
Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, <br />
And there Messapus, born of seed divine. <br />
The sign is giv&#8217;n; and, round the listed space, <br />
Each man in order fills his proper place. <br />
Reclining on their ample shields, they stand, <br />
And fix their pointed lances in the sand. <br />
Now, studious of the sight, a num&#8217;rous throng <br />
Of either sex promiscuous, old and young, <br />
Swarm from the town: by those who rest behind, <br />
The gates and walls and houses&#8217; tops are lin&#8217;d. <br />
Meantime the Queen of Heav&#8217;n beheld the sight, <br />
With eyes unpleas&#8217;d, from Mount Albano&#8217;s height <br />
(Since call&#8217;d Albano by succeeding fame, <br />
But then an empty hill, without a name). <br />
She thence survey&#8217;d the field, the Trojan pow&#8217;rs, <br />
The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow&#8217;rs. <br />
Then thus the goddess of the skies bespake, <br />
With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake, <br />
King Turnus&#8217; sister, once a lovely maid, <br />
Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray&#8217;d: <br />
Compress&#8217;d by force, but, by the grateful god, <br />
Now made the Nais of the neighb&#8217;ring flood. <br />
&#8220;O nymph, the pride of living lakes,&#8221; said she, <br />
&#8220;O most renown&#8217;d, and most belov&#8217;d by me, <br />
Long hast thou known, nor need I to record, <br />
The wanton sallies of my wand&#8217;ring lord. <br />
Of ev&#8217;ry Latian fair whom Jove misled <br />
To mount by stealth my violated bed, <br />
To thee alone I grudg&#8217;d not his embrace, <br />
But gave a part of heav&#8217;n, and an unenvied place. <br />
Now learn from me thy near approaching grief, <br />
Nor think my wishes want to thy relief. <br />
While fortune favor&#8217;d, nor Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s King denied <br />
To lend my succor to the Latian side, <br />
I sav&#8217;d thy brother, and the sinking state: <br />
But now he struggles with unequal fate, <br />
And goes, with gods averse, o&#8217;ermatch&#8217;d in might, <br />
To meet inevitable death in fight; <br />
Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. <br />
Thou, if thou dar&#8217;st, thy present aid supply; <br />
It well becomes a sister&#8217;s care to try.&#8221; <br />
At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress&#8217;d, <br />
Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast. <br />
To whom Saturnia thus: &#8220;Thy tears are late: <br />
Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch&#8217;d from fate: <br />
New tumults kindle; violate the truce: <br />
Who knows what changeful fortune may produce? <br />
&#8216;T is not a crime t&#8217; attempt what I decree; <br />
Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me.&#8221; <br />
She said, and, sailing on the winged wind, <br />
Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind. <br />
And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear: <br />
Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear; <br />
Twelve golden beams around his temples play, <br />
To mark his lineage from the God of Day. <br />
Two snowy coursers Turnus&#8217; chariot yoke, <br />
And in his hand two massy spears he shook: <br />
Then issued from the camp, in arms divine, <br />
AEneas, author of the Roman line; <br />
And by his side Ascanius took his place, <br />
The second hope of Rome&#8217;s immortal race. <br />
Adorn&#8217;d in white, a rev&#8217;rend priest appears, <br />
And off&#8217;rings to the flaming altars bears; <br />
A porket, and a lamb that never suffer&#8217;d shears. <br />
Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes, <br />
And strews the beasts, design&#8217;d for sacrifice, <br />
With salt and meal: with like officious care <br />
He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. <br />
Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds; <br />
With the same gen&#8217;rous juice the flame he feeds. <br />
AEneas then unsheath&#8217;d his shining sword, <br />
And thus with pious pray&#8217;rs the gods ador&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil, <br />
For which I have sustain&#8217;d so long a toil, <br />
Thou, King of Heav&#8217;n, and thou, the Queen of Air, <br />
Propitious now, and reconcil&#8217;d by pray&#8217;r; <br />
Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway <br />
The labors and events of arms obey; <br />
Ye living fountains, and ye running floods, <br />
All pow&#8217;rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, <br />
Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field, <br />
Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield, <br />
My Trojans shall encrease Evander&#8217;s town; <br />
Ascanius shall renounce th&#8217; Ausonian crown: <br />
All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease; <br />
Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace. <br />
But, if my juster arms prevail in fight, <br />
(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,) <br />
My Trojans shall not o&#8217;er th&#8217; Italians reign: <br />
Both equal, both unconquer&#8217;d shall remain, <br />
Join&#8217;d in their laws, their lands, and their abodes; <br />
I ask but altars for my weary gods. <br />
The care of those religious rites be mine; <br />
The crown to King Latinus I resign: <br />
His be the sov&#8217;reign sway. Nor will I share <br />
His pow&#8217;r in peace, or his command in war. <br />
For me, my friends another town shall frame, <br />
And bless the rising tow&#8217;rs with fair Lavinia&#8217;s name.&#8221; <br />
Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands, <br />
The Latian king before his altar stands. <br />
&#8220;By the same heav&#8217;n,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and earth, and main, <br />
And all the pow&#8217;rs that all the three contain; <br />
By hell below, and by that upper god <br />
Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod; <br />
So let Latona&#8217;s double offspring hear, <br />
And double-fronted Janus, what I swear: <br />
I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, <br />
And all those pow&#8217;rs attest, and all their names; <br />
Whatever chance befall on either side, <br />
No term of time this union shall divide: <br />
No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind, <br />
Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind; <br />
Not tho&#8217; the circling seas should break their bound, <br />
O&#8217;erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground; <br />
Not tho&#8217; the lamps of heav&#8217;n their spheres forsake, <br />
Hurl&#8217;d down, and hissing in the nether lake: <br />
Ev&#8217;n as this royal scepter&#8221; (for he bore <br />
A scepter in his hand) &#8220;shall never more <br />
Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth: <br />
An orphan now, cut from the mother earth <br />
By the keen ax, dishonor&#8217;d of its hair, <br />
And cas&#8217;d in brass, for Latian kings to bear.&#8221; <br />
When thus in public view the peace was tied <br />
With solemn vows, and sworn on either side, <br />
All dues perform&#8217;d which holy rites require; <br />
The victim beasts are slain before the fire, <br />
The trembling entrails from their bodies torn, <br />
And to the fatten&#8217;d flames in chargers borne. <br />
Already the Rutulians deem their man <br />
O&#8217;ermatch&#8217;d in arms, before the fight began. <br />
First rising fears are whisper&#8217;d thro&#8217; the crowd; <br />
Then, gath&#8217;ring sound, they murmur more aloud. <br />
Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes <br />
The champions&#8217; bulk, their sinews, and their size: <br />
The nearer they approach, the more is known <br />
Th&#8217; apparent disadvantage of their own. <br />
Turnus himself appears in public sight <br />
Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight. <br />
Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands <br />
With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands; <br />
And, while he mutters undistinguish&#8217;d pray&#8217;rs, <br />
A livid deadness in his cheeks appears. <br />
With anxious pleasure when Juturna view&#8217;d <br />
Th&#8217; increasing fright of the mad multitude, <br />
When their short sighs and thick&#8217;ning sobs she heard, <br />
And found their ready minds for change prepar&#8217;d; <br />
Dissembling her immortal form, she took <br />
Camertus&#8217; mien, his habit, and his look; <br />
A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known <br />
Was his great sire, and he his greater son. <br />
His shape assum&#8217;d, amid the ranks she ran, <br />
And humoring their first motions, thus began: <br />
&#8220;For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight <br />
Of one expos&#8217;d for all, in single fight? <br />
Can we, before the face of heav&#8217;n, confess <br />
Our courage colder, or our numbers less? <br />
View all the Trojan host, th&#8217; Arcadian band, <br />
And Tuscan army; count &#8216;em as they stand: <br />
Undaunted to the battle if we go, <br />
Scarce ev&#8217;ry second man will share a foe. <br />
Turnus, &#8216;t is true, in this unequal strife, <br />
Shall lose, with honor, his devoted life, <br />
Or change it rather for immortal fame, <br />
Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came: <br />
But you, a servile and inglorious band, <br />
For foreign lords shall sow your native land, <br />
Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain&#8217;d, <br />
Which have so long their lazy sons sustain&#8217;d.&#8221; <br />
With words like these, she carried her design: <br />
A rising murmur runs along the line. <br />
Then ev&#8217;n the city troops, and Latians, tir&#8217;d <br />
With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir&#8217;d: <br />
Their champion&#8217;s fate with pity they lament, <br />
And of the league, so lately sworn, repent. <br />
Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage <br />
With lying wonders, and a false presage; <br />
But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes, <br />
Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise. <br />
For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above, <br />
Appears in pomp th&#8217; imperial bird of Jove: <br />
A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes, <br />
And o&#8217;er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; <br />
Then, stooping on the fairest of the train, <br />
In his strong talons truss&#8217;d a silver swan. <br />
Th&#8217; Italians wonder at th&#8217; unusual sight; <br />
But, while he lags, and labors in his flight, <br />
Behold, the dastard fowl return anew, <br />
And with united force the foe pursue: <br />
Clam&#8217;rous around the royal hawk they fly, <br />
And, thick&#8217;ning in a cloud, o&#8217;ershade the sky. <br />
They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course; <br />
Nor can th&#8217; incumber&#8217;d bird sustain their force; <br />
But vex&#8217;d, not vanquish&#8217;d, drops the pond&#8217;rous prey, <br />
And, lighten&#8217;d of his burthen, wings his way. <br />
Th&#8217; Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight, <br />
Eager of action, and demand the fight. <br />
Then King Tolumnius, vers&#8217;d in augurs&#8217; arts, <br />
Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts: <br />
&#8220;At length &#8216;t is granted, what I long desir&#8217;d! <br />
This, this is what my frequent vows requir&#8217;d. <br />
Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey. <br />
Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way. <br />
These are the foreign foes, whose impious band, <br />
Like that rapacious bird, infest our land: <br />
But soon, like him, they shall be forc&#8217;d to sea <br />
By strength united, and forego the prey. <br />
Your timely succor to your country bring, <br />
Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, pressing onward thro&#8217; the crew, <br />
Pois&#8217;d in his lifted arm, his lance he threw. <br />
The winged weapon, whistling in the wind, <br />
Came driving on, nor miss&#8217;d the mark design&#8217;d. <br />
At once the cornel rattled in the skies; <br />
At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise. <br />
Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood, <br />
Born of Arcadian mix&#8217;d with Tuscan blood, <br />
Gylippus&#8217; sons: the fatal jav&#8217;lin flew, <br />
Aim&#8217;d at the midmost of the friendly crew. <br />
A passage thro&#8217; the jointed arms it found, <br />
Just where the belt was to the body bound, <br />
And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground. <br />
Then, fir&#8217;d with pious rage, the gen&#8217;rous train <br />
Run madly forward to revenge the slain. <br />
And some with eager haste their jav&#8217;lins throw; <br />
And some with sword in hand assault the foe. <br />
The wish&#8217;d insult the Latine troops embrace, <br />
And meet their ardor in the middle space. <br />
The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line, <br />
With equal courage obviate their design. <br />
Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate <br />
Both armies urges to their mutual fate. <br />
With impious haste their altars are o&#8217;erturn&#8217;d, <br />
The sacrifice half-broil&#8217;d, and half-unburn&#8217;d. <br />
Thick storms of steel from either army fly, <br />
And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky; <br />
Brands from the fire are missive weapons made, <br />
With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade. <br />
Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray, <br />
And bears his unregarded gods away. <br />
These on their horses vault; those yoke the car; <br />
The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war. <br />
Messapus, eager to confound the peace, <br />
Spurr&#8217;d his hot courser thro&#8217; the fighting prease, <br />
At King Aulestes, by his purple known <br />
A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown; <br />
And, with a shock encount&#8217;ring, bore him down. <br />
Backward he fell; and, as his fate design&#8217;d, <br />
The ruins of an altar were behind: <br />
There, pitching on his shoulders and his head, <br />
Amid the scatt&#8217;ring fires he lay supinely spread. <br />
The beamy spear, descending from above, <br />
His cuirass pierc&#8217;d, and thro&#8217; his body drove. <br />
Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries: <br />
&#8220;The gods have found a fitter sacrifice.&#8221; <br />
Greedy of spoils, th&#8217; Italians strip the dead <br />
Of his rich armor, and uncrown his head. <br />
Priest Corynaeus, arm&#8217;d his better hand, <br />
From his own altar, with a blazing brand; <br />
And, as Ebusus with a thund&#8217;ring pace <br />
Advanc&#8217;d to battle, dash&#8217;d it on his face: <br />
His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires; <br />
The crackling crop a noisome scent expires. <br />
Following the blow, he seiz&#8217;d his curling crown <br />
With his left hand; his other cast him down. <br />
The prostrate body with his knees he press&#8217;d, <br />
And plung&#8217;d his holy poniard in his breast. <br />
While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued <br />
The shepherd Alsus thro&#8217; the flying crowd, <br />
Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow <br />
Full on the front of his unwary foe. <br />
The broad ax enters with a crashing sound, <br />
And cleaves the chin with one continued wound; <br />
Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around. <br />
An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress&#8217;d, <br />
And seal&#8217;d their heavy lids in endless rest. <br />
But good AEneas rush&#8217;d amid the bands; <br />
Bare was his head, and naked were his hands, <br />
In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: <br />
&#8220;What sudden rage, what new desire of blood, <br />
Inflames your alter&#8217;d minds? O Trojans, cease <br />
From impious arms, nor violate the peace! <br />
By human sanctions, and by laws divine, <br />
The terms are all agreed; the war is mine. <br />
Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue; <br />
This hand alone shall right the gods and you: <br />
Our injur&#8217;d altars, and their broken vow, <br />
To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.&#8221; <br />
Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense, <br />
A winged arrow struck the pious prince. <br />
But, whether from some human hand it came, <br />
Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame: <br />
No human hand or hostile god was found, <br />
To boast the triumph of so base a wound. <br />
When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain, <br />
His chiefs dismay&#8217;d, his troops a fainting train, <br />
Th&#8217; unhop&#8217;d event his heighten&#8217;d soul inspires: <br />
At once his arms and coursers he requires; <br />
Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, <br />
And with a ready hand assumes the reins. <br />
He drives impetuous, and, where&#8217;er he goes, <br />
He leaves behind a lane of slaughter&#8217;d foes. <br />
These his lance reaches; over those he rolls <br />
His rapid car, and crushes out their souls: <br />
In vain the vanquish&#8217;d fly; the victor sends <br />
The dead men&#8217;s weapons at their living friends. <br />
Thus, on the banks of Hebrus&#8217; freezing flood, <br />
The God of Battles, in his angry mood, <br />
Clashing his sword against his brazen shield, <br />
Let loose the reins, and scours along the field: <br />
Before the wind his fiery coursers fly; <br />
Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky. <br />
Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair <br />
(Dire faces, and deform&#8217;d) surround the car; <br />
Friends of the god, and followers of the war. <br />
With fury not unlike, nor less disdain, <br />
Exulting Turnus flies along the plain: <br />
His smoking horses, at their utmost speed, <br />
He lashes on, and urges o&#8217;er the dead. <br />
Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound, <br />
The gore and gath&#8217;ring dust are dash&#8217;d around. <br />
Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war, <br />
He kill&#8217;d at hand, but Sthenelus afar: <br />
From far the sons of Imbracus he slew, <br />
Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew; <br />
Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join&#8217;d, <br />
Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind. <br />
Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field, <br />
New fir&#8217;d the Trojans, and their foes repell&#8217;d. <br />
This son of Dolon bore his grandsire&#8217;s name, <br />
But emulated more his father&#8217;s fame; <br />
His guileful father, sent a nightly spy, <br />
The Grecian camp and order to descry: <br />
Hard enterprise! and well he might require <br />
Achilles&#8217; car and horses, for his hire: <br />
But, met upon the scout, th&#8217; AEtolian prince <br />
In death bestow&#8217;d a juster recompense. <br />
Fierce Turnus view&#8217;d the Trojan from afar, <br />
And launch&#8217;d his jav&#8217;lin from his lofty car; <br />
Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, <br />
And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, <br />
Wrench&#8217;d from his feeble hold the shining sword, <br />
And plung&#8217;d it in the bosom of its lord. <br />
&#8220;Possess,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the fruit of all thy pains, <br />
And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. <br />
Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; <br />
Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!&#8221; <br />
Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew, <br />
Whom o&#8217;er his neck his flound&#8217;ring courser threw. <br />
As when loud Boreas, with his blust&#8217;ring train, <br />
Stoops from above, incumbent on the main; <br />
Where&#8217;er he flies, he drives the rack before, <br />
And rolls the billows on th&#8217; AEgaean shore: <br />
So, where resistless Turnus takes his course, <br />
The scatter&#8217;d squadrons bend before his force; <br />
His crest of horses&#8217; hair is blown behind <br />
By adverse air, and rustles in the wind. <br />
This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain, <br />
And, as the chariot roll&#8217;d along the plain, <br />
Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz&#8217;d the rein. <br />
Thus hung in air, he still retain&#8217;d his hold, <br />
The coursers frighted, and their course controll&#8217;d. <br />
The lance of Turnus reach&#8217;d him as he hung, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d his plated arms, but pass&#8217;d along, <br />
And only raz&#8217;d the skin. He turn&#8217;d, and held <br />
Against his threat&#8217;ning foe his ample shield; <br />
Then call&#8217;d for aid: but, while he cried in vain, <br />
The chariot bore him backward on the plain. <br />
He lies revers&#8217;d; the victor king descends, <br />
And strikes so justly where his helmet ends, <br />
He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk <br />
With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. <br />
While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield, <br />
The wounded prince is forc&#8217;d to leave the field: <br />
Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried, <br />
And young Ascanius, weeping by his side, <br />
Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear <br />
His limbs from earth, supported on his spear. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d in mind, regardless of the smart, <br />
He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart. <br />
The steel remains. No readier way he found <br />
To draw the weapon, than t&#8217; inlarge the wound. <br />
Eager of fight, impatient of delay, <br />
He begs; and his unwilling friends obey. <br />
Iapis was at hand to prove his art, <br />
Whose blooming youth so fir&#8217;d Apollo&#8217;s heart, <br />
That, for his love, he proffer&#8217;d to bestow <br />
His tuneful harp and his unerring bow. <br />
The pious youth, more studious how to save <br />
His aged sire, now sinking to the grave, <br />
Preferr&#8217;d the pow&#8217;r of plants, and silent praise <br />
Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays. <br />
Propp&#8217;d on his lance the pensive hero stood, <br />
And heard and saw, unmov&#8217;d, the mourning crowd. <br />
The fam&#8217;d physician tucks his robes around <br />
With ready hands, and hastens to the wound. <br />
With gentle touches he performs his part, <br />
This way and that, soliciting the dart, <br />
And exercises all his heav&#8217;nly art. <br />
All soft&#8217;ning simples, known of sov&#8217;reign use, <br />
He presses out, and pours their noble juice. <br />
These first infus&#8217;d, to lenify the pain, <br />
He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain. <br />
Then to the patron of his art he pray&#8217;d: <br />
The patron of his art refus&#8217;d his aid. <br />
Meantime the war approaches to the tents; <br />
Th&#8217; alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments: <br />
The driving dust proclaims the danger near; <br />
And first their friends, and then their foes appear: <br />
Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear. <br />
The camp is fill&#8217;d with terror and affright: <br />
The hissing shafts within the trench alight; <br />
An undistinguish&#8217;d noise ascends the sky, <br />
The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die. <br />
But now the goddess mother, mov&#8217;d with grief, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d with pity, hastens her relief. <br />
A branch of healing dittany she brought, <br />
Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought: <br />
Rough is the stem, which woolly leafs surround; <br />
The leafs with flow&#8217;rs, the flow&#8217;rs with purple crown&#8217;d, <br />
Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief <br />
To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief. <br />
This Venus brings, in clouds involv&#8217;d, and brews <br />
Th&#8217; extracted liquor with ambrosian dews, <br />
And od&#8217;rous panacee. Unseen she stands, <br />
Temp&#8217;ring the mixture with her heav&#8217;nly hands, <br />
And pours it in a bowl, already crown&#8217;d <br />
With juice of med&#8217;c&#8217;nal herbs prepar&#8217;d to bathe the wound. <br />
The leech, unknowing of superior art <br />
Which aids the cure, with this foments the part; <br />
And in a moment ceas&#8217;d the raging smart. <br />
Stanch&#8217;d is the blood, and in the bottom stands: <br />
The steel, but scarcely touch&#8217;d with tender hands, <br />
Moves up, and follows of its own accord, <br />
And health and vigor are at once restor&#8217;d. <br />
Iapis first perceiv&#8217;d the closing wound, <br />
And first the footsteps of a god he found. <br />
&#8220;Arms! arms!&#8221; he cries; &#8220;the sword and shield prepare, <br />
And send the willing chief, renew&#8217;d, to war. <br />
This is no mortal work, no cure of mine, <br />
Nor art&#8217;s effect, but done by hands divine. <br />
Some god our general to the battle sends; <br />
Some god preserves his life for greater ends.&#8221; <br />
The hero arms in haste; his hands infold <br />
His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: <br />
Inflam&#8217;d to fight, and rushing to the field, <br />
That hand sustaining the celestial shield, <br />
This gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes, <br />
That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes. <br />
Then with a close embrace he strain&#8217;d his son, <br />
And, kissing thro&#8217; his helmet, thus begun: <br />
&#8220;My son, from my example learn the war, <br />
In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare; <br />
But happier chance than mine attend thy care! <br />
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield, <br />
And crown with honors of the conquer&#8217;d field: <br />
Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth <br />
To toils of war, be mindful of my worth; <br />
Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known, <br />
For Hector&#8217;s nephew, and AEneas&#8217; son.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, striding, issued on the plain. <br />
Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num&#8217;rous train, <br />
Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take, <br />
And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. <br />
A cloud of blinding dust is rais&#8217;d around, <br />
Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground. <br />
Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far <br />
Beheld the progress of the moving war: <br />
With him the Latins view&#8217;d the cover&#8217;d plains, <br />
And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. <br />
Juturna saw th&#8217; advancing troops appear, <br />
And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. <br />
AEneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, <br />
Clos&#8217;d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. <br />
As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore <br />
From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; <br />
The painful hind with heavy heart foresees <br />
The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; <br />
With like impetuous rage the prince appears <br />
Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. <br />
And now both armies shock in open field; <br />
Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill&#8217;d. <br />
Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain <br />
(All fam&#8217;d in arms, and of the Latian train) <br />
By Gyas&#8217;, Mnestheus&#8217;, and Achates&#8217; hand. <br />
The fatal augur falls, by whose command <br />
The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued <br />
With Trojan blood, th&#8217; unhappy fight renew&#8217;d. <br />
Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky, <br />
And o&#8217;er the field the frighted Latins fly. <br />
The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, <br />
Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; <br />
Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, <br />
He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. <br />
Juturna heard, and, seiz&#8217;d with mortal fear, <br />
Forc&#8217;d from the beam her brother&#8217;s charioteer; <br />
Assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien, <br />
And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen. <br />
As the black swallow near the palace plies; <br />
O&#8217;er empty courts, and under arches, flies; <br />
Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood, <br />
To furnish her loquacious nest with food: <br />
So drives the rapid goddess o&#8217;er the plains; <br />
The smoking horses run with loosen&#8217;d reins. <br />
She steers a various course among the foes; <br />
Now here, now there, her conqu&#8217;ring brother shows; <br />
Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight, <br />
She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight. <br />
AEneas, fir&#8217;d with fury, breaks the crowd, <br />
And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud: <br />
He runs within a narrower ring, and tries <br />
To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies. <br />
If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears, <br />
And far away the Daunian hero bears. <br />
What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail; <br />
And various cares in vain his mind assail. <br />
The great Messapus, thund&#8217;ring thro&#8217; the field, <br />
In his left hand two pointed jav&#8217;lins held: <br />
Encount&#8217;ring on the prince, one dart he drew, <br />
And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw. <br />
AEneas saw it come, and, stooping low <br />
Beneath his buckler, shunn&#8217;d the threat&#8217;ning blow. <br />
The weapon hiss&#8217;d above his head, and tore <br />
The waving plume which on his helm he wore. <br />
Forced by this hostile act, and fir&#8217;d with spite, <br />
That flying Turnus still declin&#8217;d the fight, <br />
The Prince, whose piety had long repell&#8217;d <br />
His inborn ardor, now invades the field; <br />
Invokes the pow&#8217;rs of violated peace, <br />
Their rites and injur&#8217;d altars to redress; <br />
Then, to his rage abandoning the rein, <br />
With blood and slaughter&#8217;d bodies fills the plain. <br />
What god can tell, what numbers can display, <br />
The various labors of that fatal day; <br />
What chiefs and champions fell on either side, <br />
In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; <br />
Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill&#8217;d; <br />
Who shar&#8217;d the fame and fortune of the field! <br />
Jove, could&#8217;st thou view, and not avert thy sight, <br />
Two jarring nations join&#8217;d in cruel fight, <br />
Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! <br />
AEneas first Rutulian Sucro found, <br />
Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground; <br />
Betwixt his ribs the jav&#8217;lin drove so just, <br />
It reach&#8217;d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. <br />
Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; <br />
First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: <br />
Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail&#8217;d <br />
Diores, and in equal fight prevail&#8217;d. <br />
Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; <br />
Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. <br />
Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, <br />
Whom without respite at one charge he slew: <br />
Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress&#8217;d, <br />
And sad Onythes, added to the rest, <br />
Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. <br />
Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, <br />
And from Apollo&#8217;s fane to battle sent, <br />
O&#8217;erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. <br />
Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill&#8217;d, <br />
Who long had shunn&#8217;d the dangers of the field: <br />
On Lerna&#8217;s lake a silent life he led, <br />
And with his nets and angle earn&#8217;d his bread; <br />
Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, <br />
But wisely from th&#8217; infectious world withdrew: <br />
Poor was his house; his father&#8217;s painful hand <br />
Discharg&#8217;d his rent, and plow&#8217;d another&#8217;s land. <br />
As flames among the lofty woods are thrown <br />
On diff&#8217;rent sides, and both by winds are blown; <br />
The laurels crackle in the sputt&#8217;ring fire; <br />
The frighted sylvans from their shades retire: <br />
Or as two neighb&#8217;ring torrents fall from high; <br />
Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry; <br />
They roll to sea with unresisted force, <br />
And down the rocks precipitate their course: <br />
Not with less rage the rival heroes take <br />
Their diff&#8217;rent ways, nor less destruction make. <br />
With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike; <br />
And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike. <br />
Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field; <br />
And hearts are pierc&#8217;d, unknowing how to yield: <br />
They blow for blow return, and wound for wound; <br />
And heaps of bodies raise the level ground. <br />
Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs <br />
From a long royal race of Latian kings, <br />
Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown, <br />
Crush&#8217;d with the weight of an unwieldy stone: <br />
Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore <br />
His living load, his dying body tore. <br />
His starting steeds, to shun the glitt&#8217;ring sword, <br />
Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. <br />
Fierce Hyllus threaten&#8217;d high, and, face to face, <br />
Affronted Turnus in the middle space: <br />
The prince encounter&#8217;d him in full career, <br />
And at his temples aim&#8217;d the deadly spear; <br />
So fatally the flying weapon sped, <br />
That thro&#8217; his brazen helm it pierc&#8217;d his head. <br />
Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus&#8217; hand, <br />
In vain the strongest of th&#8217; Arcadian band: <br />
Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford <br />
Availing aid against th&#8217; AEnean sword, <br />
Which to his naked heart pursued the course; <br />
Nor could his plated shield sustain the force. <br />
Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow&#8217;rs, <br />
Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow&#8217;rs, <br />
Were doom&#8217;d to kill, while Heav&#8217;n prolong&#8217;d his date; <br />
But who can pass the bounds prefix&#8217;d by fate? <br />
In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held <br />
Two palaces, and was from each expell&#8217;d: <br />
Of all the mighty man, the last remains <br />
A little spot of foreign earth contains. <br />
And now both hosts their broken troops unite <br />
In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. <br />
Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join <br />
The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: <br />
Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads <br />
The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. <br />
They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d on death, impatient of disgrace; <br />
And, where one falls, another fills his place. <br />
The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son <br />
To leave th&#8217; unfinish&#8217;d fight, and storm the town: <br />
For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain <br />
In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, <br />
He views th&#8217; unguarded city from afar, <br />
In careless quiet, and secure of war. <br />
Occasion offers, and excites his mind <br />
To dare beyond the task he first design&#8217;d. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight: <br />
Attended thus, he takes a neighb&#8217;ring height; <br />
The crowding troops about their gen&#8217;ral stand, <br />
All under arms, and wait his high command. <br />
Then thus the lofty prince: &#8220;Hear and obey, <br />
Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay <br />
Jove is with us; and what I have decreed <br />
Requires our utmost vigor, and our speed. <br />
Your instant arms against the town prepare, <br />
The source of mischief, and the seat of war. <br />
This day the Latian tow&#8217;rs, that mate the sky, <br />
Shall level with the plain in ashes lie: <br />
The people shall be slaves, unless in time <br />
They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. <br />
Twice have our foes been vanquish&#8217;d on the plain: <br />
Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain? <br />
Your force against the perjur&#8217;d city bend. <br />
There it began, and there the war shall end. <br />
The peace profan&#8217;d our rightful arms requires; <br />
Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires.&#8221; <br />
He finish&#8217;d; and, one soul inspiring all, <br />
Form&#8217;d in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. <br />
Without the town, an unprovided train <br />
Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain. <br />
Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear, <br />
And those they toss aloft, and these they rear: <br />
The flames now launch&#8217;d, the feather&#8217;d arrows fly, <br />
And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky. <br />
Advancing to the front, the hero stands, <br />
And, stretching out to heav&#8217;n his pious hands, <br />
Attests the gods, asserts his innocence, <br />
Upbraids with breach of faith th&#8217; Ausonian prince; <br />
Declares the royal honor doubly stain&#8217;d, <br />
And twice the rites of holy peace profan&#8217;d. <br />
Dissenting clamors in the town arise; <br />
Each will be heard, and all at once advise. <br />
One part for peace, and one for war contends; <br />
Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends. <br />
The helpless king is hurried in the throng, <br />
And, whate&#8217;er tide prevails, is borne along. <br />
Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock, <br />
Invades the bees with suffocating smoke, <br />
They run around, or labor on their wings, <br />
Disus&#8217;d to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings; <br />
To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try; <br />
Black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the sky. <br />
But fate and envious fortune now prepare <br />
To plunge the Latins in the last despair. <br />
The queen, who saw the foes invade the town, <br />
And brands on tops of burning houses thrown, <br />
Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear&#8211; <br />
No troops of Turnus in the field appear. <br />
Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain, <br />
And then concludes the royal youth is slain. <br />
Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear <br />
The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air. <br />
She calls herself the cause of all this ill, <br />
And owns the dire effects of her ungovern&#8217;d will; <br />
She raves against the gods; she beats her breast; <br />
She tears with both her hands her purple vest: <br />
Then round a beam a running noose she tied, <br />
And, fasten&#8217;d by the neck, obscenely died. <br />
Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown, <br />
And to her dames and to her daughter known, <br />
The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair <br />
And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share: <br />
With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair. <br />
The spreading rumor fills the public place: <br />
Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace, <br />
And silent shame, are seen in ev&#8217;ry face. <br />
Latinus tears his garments as he goes, <br />
Both for his public and his private woes; <br />
With filth his venerable beard besmears, <br />
And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs. <br />
And much he blames the softness of his mind, <br />
Obnoxious to the charms of womankind, <br />
And soon seduc&#8217;d to change what he so well design&#8217;d; <br />
To break the solemn league so long desir&#8217;d, <br />
Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir&#8217;d. <br />
Now Turnus rolls aloof o&#8217;er empty plains, <br />
And here and there some straggling foes he gleans. <br />
His flying coursers please him less and less, <br />
Asham&#8217;d of easy fight and cheap success. <br />
Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind, <br />
The distant cries come driving in the wind, <br />
Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown&#8217;d; <br />
A jarring mixture, and a boding sound. <br />
&#8220;Alas!&#8221; said he, &#8220;what mean these dismal cries? <br />
What doleful clamors from the town arise?&#8221; <br />
Confus&#8217;d, he stops, and backward pulls the reins. <br />
She who the driver&#8217;s office now sustains, <br />
Replies: &#8220;Neglect, my lord, these new alarms; <br />
Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms: <br />
There want not others to defend the wall. <br />
If by your rival&#8217;s hand th&#8217; Italians fall, <br />
So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress, <br />
In honor equal, equal in success.&#8221; <br />
To this, the prince: &#8220;O sister&#8211;for I knew <br />
The peace infring&#8217;d proceeded first from you; <br />
I knew you, when you mingled first in fight; <br />
And now in vain you would deceive my sight&#8211; <br />
Why, goddess, this unprofitable care? <br />
Who sent you down from heav&#8217;n, involv&#8217;d in air, <br />
Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain, <br />
And see your brother bleeding on the plain? <br />
For to what pow&#8217;r can Turnus have recourse, <br />
Or how resist his fate&#8217;s prevailing force? <br />
These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground: <br />
Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound. <br />
I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, <br />
My name invoking to revenge his death. <br />
Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place, <br />
To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. <br />
On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies; <br />
His vest and armor are the victor&#8217;s prize. <br />
Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame, <br />
Which only wanted, to complete my shame? <br />
How will the Latins hoot their champion&#8217;s flight! <br />
How Drances will insult and point them to the sight! <br />
Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below, <br />
(Since those above so small compassion show,) <br />
Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame, <br />
Which not belies my great forefather&#8217;s name!&#8221; <br />
He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed <br />
Came Sages urging on his foamy steed: <br />
Fix&#8217;d on his wounded face a shaft he bore, <br />
And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before: <br />
&#8220;Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends <br />
Our last relief: compassionate your friends! <br />
Like lightning, fierce AEneas, rolling on, <br />
With arms invests, with flames invades the town: <br />
The brands are toss&#8217;d on high; the winds conspire <br />
To drive along the deluge of the fire. <br />
All eyes are fix&#8217;d on you: your foes rejoice; <br />
Ev&#8217;n the king staggers, and suspends his choice; <br />
Doubts to deliver or defend the town, <br />
Whom to reject, or whom to call his son. <br />
The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac&#8217;d, <br />
Herself suborning death, has breath&#8217;d her last. <br />
&#8216;T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate, <br />
With fierce Atinas&#8217; aid, defends the gate: <br />
On ev&#8217;ry side surrounded by the foe, <br />
The more they kill, the greater numbers grow; <br />
An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow. <br />
You, far aloof from your forsaken bands, <br />
Your rolling chariot drive o&#8217;er empty sands.&#8221; <br />
Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin&#8217;d, <br />
And various cares revolving in his mind: <br />
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast, <br />
And sorrow mix&#8217;d with shame, his soul oppress&#8217;d; <br />
And conscious worth lay lab&#8217;ring in his thought, <br />
And love by jealousy to madness wrought. <br />
By slow degrees his reason drove away <br />
The mists of passion, and resum&#8217;d her sway. <br />
Then, rising on his car, he turn&#8217;d his look, <br />
And saw the town involv&#8217;d in fire and smoke. <br />
A wooden tow&#8217;r with flames already blaz&#8217;d, <br />
Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais&#8217;d; <br />
And bridges laid above to join the space, <br />
And wheels below to roll from place to place. <br />
&#8220;Sister, the Fates have vanquish&#8217;d: let us go <br />
The way which Heav&#8217;n and my hard fortune show. <br />
The fight is fix&#8217;d; nor shall the branded name <br />
Of a base coward blot your brother&#8217;s fame. <br />
Death is my choice; but suffer me to try <br />
My force, and vent my rage before I die.&#8221; <br />
He said; and, leaping down without delay, <br />
Thro&#8217; crowds of scatter&#8217;d foes he freed his way. <br />
Striding he pass&#8217;d, impetuous as the wind, <br />
And left the grieving goddess far behind. <br />
As when a fragment, from a mountain torn <br />
By raging tempests, or by torrents borne, <br />
Or sapp&#8217;d by time, or loosen&#8217;d from the roots&#8211; <br />
Prone thro&#8217; the void the rocky ruin shoots, <br />
Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep; <br />
Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep: <br />
Involv&#8217;d alike, they rush to nether ground; <br />
Stunn&#8217;d with the shock they fall, and stunn&#8217;d from earth rebound: <br />
So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town, <br />
Should&#8217;ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down. <br />
Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, <br />
Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, <br />
And sanguine streams the slipp&#8217;ry ground embrue. <br />
First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, <br />
He cries aloud, to make the combat cease: <br />
&#8220;Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! <br />
The fight is mine; and me the gods require. <br />
&#8216;T is just that I should vindicate alone <br />
The broken truce, or for the breach atone. <br />
This day shall free from wars th&#8217; Ausonian state, <br />
Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.&#8221; <br />
Both armies from their bloody work desist, <br />
And, bearing backward, form a spacious list. <br />
The Trojan hero, who receiv&#8217;d from fame <br />
The welcome sound, and heard the champion&#8217;s name, <br />
Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, <br />
Greedy of war where greater glory calls. <br />
He springs to fight, exulting in his force; <br />
His jointed armor rattles in the course. <br />
Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, <br />
Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows, <br />
His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, <br />
And shakes the sounding forest on his sides. <br />
The nations, overaw&#8217;d, surcease the fight; <br />
Immovable their bodies, fix&#8217;d their sight. <br />
Ev&#8217;n death stands still; nor from above they throw <br />
Their darts, nor drive their batt&#8217;ring-rams below. <br />
In silent order either army stands, <br />
And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands. <br />
Th&#8217; Ausonian king beholds, with wond&#8217;ring sight, <br />
Two mighty champions match&#8217;d in single fight, <br />
Born under climes remote, and brought by fate, <br />
With swords to try their titles to the state. <br />
Now, in clos&#8217;d field, each other from afar <br />
They view; and, rushing on, begin the war. <br />
They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet; <br />
The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet: <br />
Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high, <br />
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly. <br />
Courage conspires with chance, and both ingage <br />
With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage. <br />
As when two bulls for their fair female fight <br />
In Sila&#8217;s shades, or on Taburnus&#8217; height; <br />
With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies; <br />
Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes, <br />
And wait th&#8217; event; which victor they shall bear, <br />
And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year: <br />
With rage of love the jealous rivals burn, <br />
And push for push, and wound for wound return; <br />
Their dewlaps gor&#8217;d, their sides are lav&#8217;d in blood; <br />
Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro&#8217; the wood: <br />
Such was the combat in the listed ground; <br />
So clash their swords, and so their shields resound. <br />
Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays <br />
The champions&#8217; fate, and each exactly weighs. <br />
On this side, life and lucky chance ascends; <br />
Loaded with death, that other scale descends. <br />
Rais&#8217;d on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow <br />
Full on the helm of his unguarded foe: <br />
Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side, <br />
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide. <br />
But all in pieces flies the traitor sword, <br />
And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord. <br />
Now &#8216;t is but death, or flight; disarm&#8217;d he flies, <br />
When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. <br />
Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join&#8217;d, <br />
Hurrying to war, disorder&#8217;d in his mind, <br />
Snatch&#8217;d the first weapon which his haste could find. <br />
&#8216;T was not the fated sword his father bore, <br />
But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. <br />
This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; <br />
But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, <br />
The mortal-temper&#8217;d steel deceiv&#8217;d his hand: <br />
The shiver&#8217;d fragments shone amid the sand. <br />
Surpris&#8217;d with fear, he fled along the field, <br />
And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel&#8217;d; <br />
For here the Trojan troops the list surround, <br />
And there the pass is clos&#8217;d with pools and marshy ground. <br />
AEneas hastens, tho&#8217; with heavier pace&#8211; <br />
His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, <br />
And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse&#8211; <br />
Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. <br />
Thus, when a fearful stag is clos&#8217;d around <br />
With crimson toils, or in a river found, <br />
High on the bank the deep-mouth&#8217;d hound appears, <br />
Still opening, following still, where&#8217;er he steers; <br />
The persecuted creature, to and fro, <br />
Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: <br />
Steep is th&#8217; ascent, and, if he gains the land, <br />
The purple death is pitch&#8217;d along the strand. <br />
His eager foe, determin&#8217;d to the chase, <br />
Stretch&#8217;d at his length, gains ground at ev&#8217;ry pace; <br />
Now to his beamy head he makes his way, <br />
And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: <br />
Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; <br />
He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: <br />
The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; <br />
The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies. <br />
Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames <br />
His tardy troops, and, calling by their names, <br />
Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats <br />
The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats <br />
To lay in ashes, if they dare supply <br />
With arms or aid his vanquish&#8217;d enemy: <br />
Thus menacing, he still pursues the course, <br />
With vigor, tho&#8217; diminish&#8217;d of his force. <br />
Ten times already round the listed place <br />
One chief had fled, and t&#8217;other giv&#8217;n the chase: <br />
No trivial prize is play&#8217;d; for on the life <br />
Or death of Turnus now depends the strife. <br />
Within the space, an olive tree had stood, <br />
A sacred shade, a venerable wood, <br />
For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins&#8217; guardian god. <br />
Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav&#8217;d, <br />
Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav&#8217;d. <br />
With heedless hands the Trojans fell&#8217;d the tree, <br />
To make the ground inclos&#8217;d for combat free. <br />
Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, <br />
Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; <br />
Then stoop&#8217;d, and tugg&#8217;d with force immense, to free <br />
Th&#8217; incumber&#8217;d spear from the tenacious tree; <br />
That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, <br />
His flying weapon might from far attain. <br />
Confus&#8217;d with fear, bereft of human aid, <br />
Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, <br />
Where I thy foster son receiv&#8217;d my birth, <br />
Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand <br />
Your plant has honor&#8217;d, which your foes profan&#8217;d, <br />
Propitious hear my pious pray&#8217;r!&#8221; He said, <br />
Nor with successless vows invok&#8217;d their aid. <br />
Th&#8217; incumbent hero wrench&#8217;d, and pull&#8217;d, and strain&#8217;d; <br />
But still the stubborn earth the steel detain&#8217;d. <br />
Juturna took her time; and, while in vain <br />
He strove, assum&#8217;d Meticus&#8217; form again, <br />
And, in that imitated shape, restor&#8217;d <br />
To the despairing prince his Daunian sword. <br />
The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief, <br />
Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief, <br />
T&#8217; assert her offspring with a greater deed, <br />
From the tough root the ling&#8217;ring weapon freed. <br />
Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance: <br />
One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance; <br />
And both resolv&#8217;d alike to try their fatal chance. <br />
Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke, <br />
Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock: <br />
&#8220;What new arrest, O Queen of Heav&#8217;n, is sent <br />
To stop the Fates now lab&#8217;ring in th&#8217; event? <br />
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue? <br />
Divine AEneas, (and thou know&#8217;st it too,) <br />
Foredoom&#8217;d, to these celestial seats are due. <br />
What more attempts for Turnus can be made, <br />
That thus thou ling&#8217;rest in this lonely shade? <br />
Is it becoming of the due respect <br />
And awful honor of a god elect, <br />
A wound unworthy of our state to feel, <br />
Patient of human hands and earthly steel? <br />
Or seems it just, the sister should restore <br />
A second sword, when one was lost before, <br />
And arm a conquer&#8217;d wretch against his conqueror? <br />
For what, without thy knowledge and avow, <br />
Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do? <br />
At last, in deference to my love, forbear <br />
To lodge within thy soul this anxious care; <br />
Reclin&#8217;d upon my breast, thy grief unload: <br />
Who should relieve the goddess, but the god? <br />
Now all things to their utmost issue tend, <br />
Push&#8217;d by the Fates to their appointed end. <br />
While leave was giv&#8217;n thee, and a lawful hour <br />
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow&#8217;r, <br />
Toss&#8217;d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress, <br />
And, driv&#8217;n ashore, with hostile arms oppress; <br />
Deform the royal house; and, from the side <br />
Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride: <br />
Now cease at my command.&#8221; The Thund&#8217;rer said; <br />
And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made: <br />
&#8220;Because your dread decree too well I knew, <br />
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. <br />
Else should you not behold me here, alone, <br />
Involv&#8217;d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, <br />
But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight <br />
Engag&#8217;d against my foes in mortal fight. <br />
&#8216;T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife <br />
By my command, to save her brother&#8217;s life&#8211; <br />
At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, <br />
(The most religious oath the gods can take,) <br />
With this restriction, not to bend the bow, <br />
Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. <br />
And now, resign&#8217;d to your superior might, <br />
And tir&#8217;d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. <br />
This let me beg (and this no fates withstand) <br />
Both for myself and for your father&#8217;s land, <br />
That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace, <br />
(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,) <br />
The laws of either nation be the same; <br />
But let the Latins still retain their name, <br />
Speak the same language which they spoke before, <br />
Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore. <br />
Call them not Trojans: perish the renown <br />
And name of Troy, with that detested town. <br />
Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign <br />
And Rome&#8217;s immortal majesty remain.&#8221; <br />
Then thus the founder of mankind replies <br />
(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes): <br />
&#8220;Can Saturn&#8217;s issue, and heav&#8217;n&#8217;s other heir, <br />
Such endless anger in her bosom bear? <br />
Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; <br />
But quench the choler you foment in vain. <br />
From ancient blood th&#8217; Ausonian people sprung, <br />
Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. <br />
The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: <br />
I will, myself, their common rites provide; <br />
The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. <br />
All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; <br />
And her lost sons forget from whence they came. <br />
From blood so mix&#8217;d, a pious race shall flow, <br />
Equal to gods, excelling all below. <br />
No nation more respect to you shall pay, <br />
Or greater off&#8217;rings on your altars lay.&#8221; <br />
Juno consents, well pleas&#8217;d that her desires <br />
Had found success, and from the cloud retires. <br />
The peace thus made, the Thund&#8217;rer next prepares <br />
To force the wat&#8217;ry goddess from the wars. <br />
Deep in the dismal regions void of light, <br />
Three daughters at a birth were born to Night: <br />
These their brown mother, brooding on her care, <br />
Indued with windy wings to flit in air, <br />
With serpents girt alike, and crown&#8217;d with hissing hair. <br />
In heav&#8217;n the Dirae call&#8217;d, and still at hand, <br />
Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, <br />
His ministers of wrath, and ready still <br />
The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, <br />
Whene&#8217;er the moody sire, to wreak his hate <br />
On realms or towns deserving of their fate, <br />
Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care, <br />
And terrifies the guilty world with war. <br />
One sister plague if these from heav&#8217;n he sent, <br />
To fright Juturna with a dire portent. <br />
The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow <br />
Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow, <br />
Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies, <br />
And drench&#8217;d in pois&#8217;nous juice, the sure destruction flies. <br />
With such a sudden and unseen a flight <br />
Shot thro&#8217; the clouds the daughter of the night. <br />
Soon as the field inclos&#8217;d she had in view, <br />
And from afar her destin&#8217;d quarry knew, <br />
Contracted, to the boding bird she turns, <br />
Which haunts the ruin&#8217;d piles and hallow&#8217;d urns, <br />
And beats about the tombs with nightly wings, <br />
Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings. <br />
Thus lessen&#8217;d in her form, with frightful cries <br />
The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies, <br />
Flaps on his shield, and flutters o&#8217;er his eyes. <br />
A lazy chillness crept along his blood; <br />
Chok&#8217;d was his voice; his hair with horror stood. <br />
Juturna from afar beheld her fly, <br />
And knew th&#8217; ill omen, by her screaming cry <br />
And stridor of her wings. Amaz&#8217;d with fear, <br />
Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair. <br />
&#8220;Ah me!&#8221; she cries, &#8220;in this unequal strife <br />
What can thy sister more to save thy life? <br />
Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend <br />
In arms with that inexorable fiend? <br />
Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright <br />
My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night; <br />
The lashing of your wings I know too well, <br />
The sounding flight, and fun&#8217;ral screams of hell! <br />
These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove, <br />
The worthy recompense of ravish&#8217;d love! <br />
Did he for this exempt my life from fate? <br />
O hard conditions of immortal state, <br />
Tho&#8217; born to death, not privileg&#8217;d to die, <br />
But forc&#8217;d to bear impos&#8217;d eternity! <br />
Take back your envious bribes, and let me go <br />
Companion to my brother&#8217;s ghost below! <br />
The joys are vanish&#8217;d: nothing now remains, <br />
Of life immortal, but immortal pains. <br />
What earth will open her devouring womb, <br />
To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!&#8221; <br />
She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said, <br />
But in her azure mantle wrapp&#8217;d her head, <br />
Then plung&#8217;d into her stream, with deep despair, <br />
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air. <br />
Now stern AEneas waves his weighty spear <br />
Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear: <br />
&#8220;What farther subterfuge can Turnus find? <br />
What empty hopes are harbor&#8217;d in his mind? <br />
&#8216;T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight; <br />
Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight. <br />
Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare <br />
What skill and courage can attempt in war; <br />
Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky; <br />
Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!&#8221; <br />
The champion shook his head, and made this short reply: <br />
&#8220;No threats of thine my manly mind can move; <br />
&#8216;T is hostile heav&#8217;n I dread, and partial Jove.&#8221; <br />
He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress&#8217;d <br />
The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast. <br />
Then, as he roll&#8217;d his troubled eyes around, <br />
An antique stone he saw, the common bound <br />
Of neighb&#8217;ring fields, and barrier of the ground; <br />
So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days <br />
Th&#8217; enormous weight from earth could hardly raise. <br />
He heav&#8217;d it at a lift, and, pois&#8217;d on high, <br />
Ran stagg&#8217;ring on against his enemy, <br />
But so disorder&#8217;d, that he scarcely knew <br />
His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. <br />
His knocking knees are bent beneath the load, <br />
And shiv&#8217;ring cold congeals his vital blood. <br />
The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short <br />
For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort. <br />
And as, when heavy sleep has clos&#8217;d the sight, <br />
The sickly fancy labors in the night; <br />
We seem to run; and, destitute of force, <br />
Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course: <br />
In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; <br />
The nerves, unbrac&#8217;d, their usual strength deny; <br />
And on the tongue the falt&#8217;ring accents die: <br />
So Turnus far&#8217;d; whatever means he tried, <br />
All force of arms and points of art employ&#8217;d, <br />
The Fury flew athwart, and made th&#8217; endeavor void. <br />
A thousand various thoughts his soul confound; <br />
He star&#8217;d about, nor aid nor issue found; <br />
His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround. <br />
Once more he pauses, and looks out again, <br />
And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain. <br />
Trembling he views the thund&#8217;ring chief advance, <br />
And brandishing aloft the deadly lance: <br />
Amaz&#8217;d he cow&#8217;rs beneath his conqu&#8217;ring foe, <br />
Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow. <br />
Astonish&#8217;d while he stands, and fix&#8217;d with fear, <br />
Aim&#8217;d at his shield he sees th&#8217; impending spear. <br />
The hero measur&#8217;d first, with narrow view, <br />
The destin&#8217;d mark; and, rising as he threw, <br />
With its full swing the fatal weapon flew. <br />
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls, <br />
Or stones from batt&#8217;ring-engines break the walls: <br />
Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong, <br />
The lance drove on, and bore the death along. <br />
Naught could his sev&#8217;nfold shield the prince avail, <br />
Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail: <br />
It pierc&#8217;d thro&#8217; all, and with a grisly wound <br />
Transfix&#8217;d his thigh, and doubled him to ground. <br />
With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky: <br />
Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply. <br />
Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid, <br />
With eyes cast upward, and with arms display&#8217;d, <br />
And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;I know my death deserv&#8217;d, nor hope to live: <br />
Use what the gods and thy good fortune give. <br />
Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown&#8211; <br />
Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son&#8211; <br />
Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave; <br />
And for Anchises&#8217; sake old Daunus save! <br />
Or, if thy vow&#8217;d revenge pursue my death, <br />
Give to my friends my body void of breath! <br />
The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life; <br />
Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife: <br />
Against a yielded man, &#8216;t is mean ignoble strife.&#8221; <br />
In deep suspense the Trojan seem&#8217;d to stand, <br />
And, just prepar&#8217;d to strike, repress&#8217;d his hand. <br />
He roll&#8217;d his eyes, and ev&#8217;ry moment felt <br />
His manly soul with more compassion melt; <br />
When, casting down a casual glance, he spied <br />
The golden belt that glitter&#8217;d on his side, <br />
The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore <br />
From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore. <br />
Then, rous&#8217;d anew to wrath, he loudly cries <br />
(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes): <br />
&#8220;Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend, <br />
Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend? <br />
To his sad soul a grateful off&#8217;ring go! <br />
&#8216;T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow.&#8221; <br />
He rais&#8217;d his arm aloft, and, at the word, <br />
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword. <br />
The streaming blood distain&#8217;d his arms around, <br />
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro&#8217; the wound.</p>
