				<p>BOOK XI </p>
<p>AND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of<br />
light alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with<br />
the ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She<br />
took her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses&#8217; ship which was<br />
middlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either<br />
side, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on<br />
the other towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes,<br />
well-assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up their<br />
ships at the two ends of the line. There she took her stand, and<br />
raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with<br />
courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all their<br />
might, so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go home<br />
in their ships.<br />
The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves<br />
for battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly<br />
greaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of<br />
silver; and about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had<br />
once given him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as<br />
Cyprus that the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he<br />
gave it to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of<br />
gold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared<br />
themselves up towards the neck, three upon either side, like the<br />
rainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal<br />
men. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of<br />
gold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to<br />
hang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his<br />
body when he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze<br />
running all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were<br />
twenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle:<br />
this last was made to show a Gorgon&#8217;s head, fierce and grim, with Rout<br />
and Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of<br />
silver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads<br />
that sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.<br />
On his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, and<br />
four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then he<br />
grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his<br />
armour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno and<br />
Minerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene.<br />
Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold<br />
them in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot<br />
clad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the<br />
dawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got<br />
there, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent<br />
of evil sound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for<br />
he was about to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.<br />
The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,<br />
were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was<br />
honoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of<br />
Antenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god.<br />
Hector&#8217;s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful<br />
star that shines for a moment through a rent in the clouds and is<br />
again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now seen in the front<br />
ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed<br />
like the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.<br />
And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a<br />
rich man&#8217;s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did<br />
the Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood<br />
for yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better<br />
of the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the<br />
only god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed<br />
quietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.<br />
All of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to<br />
the Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from<br />
all, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon<br />
the city of the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of<br />
bronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the slain.<br />
Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts<br />
rained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour<br />
drew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get<br />
his midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is<br />
tired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that<br />
rang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy.<br />
Agamemnon led them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his<br />
people, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang<br />
from his chariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck<br />
him on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail<br />
against the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his<br />
brains were battered in and he was killed in full fight.<br />
Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with<br />
their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on<br />
to kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the<br />
other born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard<br />
driving, while noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once<br />
taken both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound<br />
them with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a<br />
ransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in<br />
the chest above the nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus<br />
hard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he<br />
stripped their goodly armour from off them and recognized them, for he<br />
had already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida.<br />
As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great<br />
jaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back to<br />
his lair- the hind can do nothing for them even though she be close<br />
by, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick<br />
forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty monster-<br />
so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they<br />
were themselves flying panic before the Argives.<br />
Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and<br />
brave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in<br />
preventing Helen&#8217;s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely<br />
bribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the<br />
same chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand- for they had<br />
lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son of<br />
Atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from<br />
their chariot. &#8220;Take us alive,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;son of Atreus, and you<br />
shall receive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great<br />
store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy<br />
you with a very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at<br />
the ships of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but<br />
they heard no pitiful answer in return. &#8220;If,&#8221; said Agamemnon, &#8220;you are<br />
sons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that<br />
Menelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be<br />
killed and not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul<br />
iniquity of your father.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,<br />
smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost<br />
upon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he<br />
cut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the<br />
crowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and<br />
wherever the ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other<br />
Achaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in<br />
rout before them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen,<br />
and the thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off<br />
the plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and<br />
cheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze-<br />
the eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets<br />
shrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame- even so fell<br />
the heads of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and<br />
many a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways<br />
of war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful<br />
now to vultures than to their wives.<br />
Jove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage<br />
and din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out<br />
lustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of<br />
Dardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild<br />
fig-tree making always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting,<br />
and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the<br />
Scaean gates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for the<br />
others to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the<br />
middle of the plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when a<br />
lion has attacked them in the dead of night- he springs on one of<br />
them, seizes her neck in the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up<br />
her blood and gorges himself upon her entrails- even so did King<br />
Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost<br />
as they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong<br />
from his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded<br />
his spear with fury.<br />
But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,<br />
the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,<br />
thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then<br />
told Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said<br />
he, &#8220;fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector- say that so long as he<br />
sees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,<br />
he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,<br />
but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to<br />
his chariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he<br />
reach the ships and night falls at the going down of the sun.&#8221;<br />
Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the<br />
crests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot<br />
and horses. Then she said, &#8220;Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in<br />
counsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long<br />
as you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan<br />
ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of<br />
the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow,<br />
and takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to<br />
slay till you reach the ships, and till night falls at the going<br />
down of the sun.&#8221;<br />
When she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed<br />
from his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about<br />
everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and<br />
stirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round,<br />
and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part<br />
strengthened their battalions. The battle was now in array and they<br />
stood face to face with one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward<br />
in his eagerness to be ahead of all others.<br />
Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,<br />
whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face<br />
Agamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of<br />
great stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of<br />
sheep. Cisses, his mother&#8217;s father, brought him up in his own house<br />
when he was a child- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached<br />
manhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and was for giving him<br />
his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married he set out<br />
to fight the Achaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these he<br />
had left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that<br />
naw met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with one<br />
another, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on<br />
the girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting<br />
to his strength of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor<br />
nearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver and<br />
was turned aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught<br />
it from his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion;<br />
he then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the<br />
neck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of<br />
bronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his<br />
wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given much for<br />
her: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised<br />
later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from the<br />
countless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus<br />
then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of the<br />
Achaeans.<br />
When noble Coon, Antenor&#8217;s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were<br />
his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he<br />
got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his<br />
arm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the<br />
arm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this<br />
did he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that<br />
flew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to drag<br />
off the body of his brother- his father&#8217;s son- by the foot, and was<br />
crying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon<br />
struck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was<br />
dragging the dead body through the press of men under cover of his<br />
shield: he then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas.<br />
Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son<br />
of Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades.<br />
As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went<br />
about attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with<br />
great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the<br />
wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the<br />
Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and<br />
dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour-<br />
even so sharp were the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his<br />
chariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in<br />
great agony. With a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, &#8220;My<br />
friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships<br />
yourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight the whole day<br />
through against the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and<br />
they flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam<br />
and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of<br />
the battle.<br />
When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the<br />
Trojans and Lycians saying, &#8220;Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors,<br />
be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their<br />
best man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph;<br />
charge the foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater<br />
glory.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a<br />
huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did<br />
Hector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans.<br />
Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight<br />
like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its<br />
deep blue waters into fury.<br />
What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed<br />
in the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,<br />
Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;<br />
Aesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains<br />
of the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and<br />
file. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south<br />
and beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves of<br />
the sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the<br />
wandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell by<br />
the hand of Hector.<br />
All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would<br />
have fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to<br />
Diomed, &#8220;Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget<br />
our prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we<br />
shall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.&#8221;<br />
And Diomed answered, &#8220;Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall<br />
have scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the<br />
Trojans rather than to us.&#8221;<br />
With these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the<br />
ground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses<br />
killed Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they<br />
had stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing<br />
havoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the<br />
hounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay<br />
them, and the Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their<br />
flight from Hector.<br />
They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of<br />
Merops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of<br />
divination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would<br />
not obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of<br />
Tydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses<br />
killed Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.<br />
And now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that<br />
neither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one<br />
another. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the<br />
hip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly<br />
with, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of it<br />
at some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost<br />
until he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and<br />
Ulysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed<br />
by the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and<br />
said to Ulysses who was beside him, &#8220;Great Hector is bearing down upon<br />
us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his<br />
mark. He had aimed at Hector&#8217;s head near the top of his helmet, but<br />
bronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear<br />
was stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal,<br />
which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great<br />
bound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped<br />
himself with his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had<br />
fallen on his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed<br />
in among the foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen it<br />
strike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing<br />
back into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he<br />
saved his life. But Diomed made at him with his spear and said,<br />
&#8220;Dog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels.<br />
Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has<br />
again saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end of<br />
you hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be<br />
my helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but<br />
Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning<br />
against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of<br />
Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from<br />
off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield<br />
from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow<br />
that sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of<br />
Diomed&#8217;s right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in the<br />
ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from his<br />
hiding-place, and taunted him saying, &#8220;You are wounded- my arrow has<br />
not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly and<br />
killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion,<br />
would have had a truce from evil.&#8221;<br />
Diomed all undaunted answered, &#8220;Archer, you who without your bow are<br />
nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single<br />
combat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve<br />
you in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the<br />
sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had<br />
hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound<br />
a man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my<br />
weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and<br />
his children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the<br />
earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this<br />
cover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the<br />
pain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and<br />
bade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.<br />
Ulysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they<br />
were all panic-stricken. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he to himself in his dismay,<br />
&#8220;what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these<br />
odds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,<br />
for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.<br />
But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards<br />
quit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand<br />
firm and hold his own.&#8221;<br />
While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced<br />
and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds<br />
and lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair<br />
whetting his white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear<br />
the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold<br />
their ground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses.<br />
First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the<br />
shoulder with a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After<br />
these he struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had<br />
just sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched<br />
the earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on<br />
to wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,<br />
hero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close to<br />
Ulysses he said, &#8220;Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,<br />
this day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of<br />
Hippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before<br />
my spear.&#8221;<br />
With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went<br />
through the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,<br />
tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer<br />
it to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour<br />
was not yet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, &#8220;Wretch, you<br />
shall now surely die. You have stayed me from fighting further with<br />
the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to<br />
myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.&#8221;<br />
Socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him<br />
in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his<br />
chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him<br />
saying, &#8220;O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been<br />
too quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not<br />
even in death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the<br />
ravening vultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark<br />
wings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will<br />
give me my due rites of burial.&#8221;<br />
So saying he drew Socus&#8217;s heavy spear out of his flesh and from<br />
his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so<br />
that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was<br />
bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towards<br />
him; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and<br />
help him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did<br />
brave Menelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close<br />
beside him and said, &#8220;Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your<br />
people, the cry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had<br />
cut him off and were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us<br />
make our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I<br />
fear he may come to harm for all his valour if he be left without<br />
support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.&#8221;<br />
He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had<br />
gathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the<br />
carcase of some homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag<br />
has fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his<br />
strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savage<br />
jackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven<br />
sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and the<br />
lion robs them of their prey- even so did Trojans many and brave<br />
gather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept them<br />
off with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before him<br />
like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all<br />
directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out of<br />
the press while his squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed<br />
furiously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus, a bastard son of<br />
Priam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes;<br />
as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from the mountains<br />
on to the plain, big with the rain of heaven- many a dry oak and<br />
many a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast<br />
into the sea- even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over<br />
the plain, slaying both men and horses.<br />
Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting<br />
on the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,<br />
where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor<br />
and brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter<br />
with his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks<br />
that were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no<br />
ground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed the<br />
prowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, by wounding him in the<br />
right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in<br />
great fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans might<br />
take him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, &#8220;Nestor son of<br />
Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; take<br />
Machaon with you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as you<br />
can. A physician is worth more than several other men put together,<br />
for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.&#8221;<br />
Nestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at<br />
once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician<br />
Aesculapius went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward<br />
nothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.<br />
Then Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from<br />
his place beside him, &#8220;Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme<br />
wing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,<br />
they and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him;<br />
I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and<br />
horses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,<br />
and where the cry of battle is loudest.&#8221;<br />
With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip<br />
they drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans,<br />
over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was<br />
bespattered with blood, and the rail round the car was covered with<br />
splashes both from the horses&#8217; hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels.<br />
Hector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of the<br />
fight, and his presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his<br />
spear was not long idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks<br />
with sword and spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son<br />
of Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a<br />
better man than himself.<br />
Then father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart<br />
of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-<br />
looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some<br />
wild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly<br />
backwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their<br />
stockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick<br />
of their herd- he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the<br />
darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning<br />
brands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he<br />
slinks foiled and angry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against his<br />
will, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the<br />
Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken<br />
about his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn- boys beat<br />
him but he is too many for them, and though they lay about with<br />
their sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill they<br />
at last drive him from the field- even so did the Trojans and their<br />
allies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield with<br />
their darts. Now and again he would turn and show fight, keeping<br />
back the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat;<br />
but he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships.<br />
Single-handed he stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: the<br />
spears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty<br />
shield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground<br />
ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.<br />
Now when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was<br />
being overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and<br />
hurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below<br />
the midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped<br />
the armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed<br />
an arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow<br />
broke, but the point that was left in the wound dragged on the<br />
thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save<br />
his life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans, &#8220;My friends, princes<br />
and counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is<br />
being overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fight<br />
alive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.&#8221;<br />
Even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came<br />
near, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their<br />
shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and<br />
turned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.<br />
Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the<br />
mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out<br />
of the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles<br />
saw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship<br />
watching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the<br />
ship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came<br />
out looking like Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of the<br />
ill that presently befell him. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Achilles do you call<br />
me? what do you what do you want with me?&#8221; And Achilles answered,<br />
&#8220;Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that I<br />
shall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in great<br />
straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearing<br />
away wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaon<br />
son of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses went<br />
by me at full speed.&#8221;<br />
Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off<br />
running by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.<br />
When Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of<br />
Neleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses<br />
from the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside<br />
to dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they<br />
came inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had<br />
awarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a<br />
mess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given<br />
her to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First she<br />
set for them a fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it<br />
there was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink,<br />
with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare<br />
workmanship which the old man had brought with him from home,<br />
studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which<br />
there were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand<br />
on. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the table<br />
when it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the<br />
woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she<br />
grated goat&#8217;s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a<br />
handful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she<br />
bade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus quenched<br />
their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this moment<br />
Patroclus appeared at the door.<br />
When the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,<br />
led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but<br />
Patroclus stood where he was and said, &#8220;Noble sir, I may not stay, you<br />
cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be<br />
trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were<br />
bearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he is<br />
Machaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You,<br />
sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where<br />
no blame should lie.&#8221;<br />
And Nestor answered, &#8220;Why should Achilles care to know how many of<br />
the Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns in<br />
our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed son<br />
of Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been<br />
hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man<br />
from the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless<br />
Achilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will<br />
he wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we<br />
perish one upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in<br />
me any longer; would that I Were still young and strong as in the days<br />
when there was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some<br />
cattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus<br />
a dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart<br />
thrown my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his<br />
cows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great fear.<br />
We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of<br />
cattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and<br />
as many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a<br />
hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running<br />
with them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of<br />
Neleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus was<br />
glad in that I had taken so much, though it was the first time I had<br />
ever been in the field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that<br />
all in Elis to whom there was a debt owing should come; and the<br />
leading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many to<br />
whom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had<br />
been oppressed with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and<br />
had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had<br />
perished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the others<br />
had all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had looked<br />
down upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of<br />
cattle and a great flock of sheep- three hundred in all- and he took<br />
their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him in<br />
Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots<br />
with them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King<br />
Augeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss<br />
of his horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done,<br />
and took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man<br />
might have less than his full share.<br />
&#8220;Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods<br />
throughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a<br />
body, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with<br />
them the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and<br />
unused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched<br />
upon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they<br />
would destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had<br />
crossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus<br />
and bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers<br />
in Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and<br />
hid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;<br />
nevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I<br />
was, I fought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of<br />
them. There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene,<br />
and there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited till<br />
morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force.<br />
Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the<br />
sacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty<br />
Jove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to<br />
Minerva. After this we took supper in our companies, and laid us<br />
down to rest each in his armour by the river.<br />
&#8220;The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take<br />
it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for<br />
them. When the sun&#8217;s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined<br />
battle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had<br />
begun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses- to wit<br />
the warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his<br />
eldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues of<br />
every herb which grows upon the face of the earth. I speared him as he<br />
was coming towards me, and when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang<br />
upon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled<br />
in all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen (the<br />
best man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like a<br />
whirlwind, taking fifty chariots- and in each of them two men bit<br />
the dust, slain by my spear. I should have even killed the two<br />
Moliones sons of Actor, unless their real father, Neptune lord of<br />
the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out<br />
of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, for<br />
we chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in<br />
their armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium rich in<br />
wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called Alision,<br />
at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I slew the last<br />
man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back from<br />
Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and among<br />
mortal men to Nestor.<br />
&#8220;Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is<br />
for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it<br />
hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did<br />
not Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia<br />
to Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all<br />
that he said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while<br />
beating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when we got there we<br />
found Menoetius and yourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight<br />
Peleus was in the outer court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a<br />
heifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in<br />
his hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning<br />
sacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment<br />
we stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us<br />
by the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such<br />
hospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied<br />
ourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you<br />
to join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old men<br />
charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles<br />
fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers, while Menoetius<br />
the son of Actor spoke thus to you: &#8216;My son,&#8217; said he, &#8216;Achilles is of<br />
nobler birth than you are, but you are older than he, though he is far<br />
the better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the<br />
right way, and he will follow you to his own profit.&#8217; Thus did your<br />
father charge you, but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say<br />
all this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with<br />
heaven&#8217;s help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend&#8217;s<br />
advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother<br />
has told him something from Jove, then let him send you, and let the<br />
rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance you may bring<br />
light and saving to the Danaans. And let him send you into battle clad<br />
in his own armour, that the Trojans may mistake you for him and<br />
leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get<br />
their breath, for they are hard pressed and there is little<br />
breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive a<br />
tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships.&#8221;<br />
With these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off<br />
running by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus.<br />
When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their<br />
place of assembly and court of justice, with their altars dedicated to<br />
the gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh<br />
with an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from his<br />
head and shoulders, and black blood welled from his cruel wound, but<br />
his mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him had<br />
compassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, &#8220;O unhappy princes and<br />
counsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds<br />
of Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native land?<br />
say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector<br />
in check, or will they fall now before his spear?&#8221;<br />
Wounded Eurypylus made answer, &#8220;Noble Patroclus, there is no hope<br />
left for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they<br />
that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the<br />
hands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save<br />
me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the<br />
black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those<br />
gracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,<br />
who was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the<br />
centaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that<br />
the one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of<br />
healing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hero Eurypylus,&#8221; replied the brave son of Menoetius, &#8220;how may these<br />
things be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble<br />
Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I<br />
will not be unmindful your distress.&#8221;<br />
With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,<br />
and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground for<br />
him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp<br />
arrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with<br />
warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his<br />
hands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which<br />
killed all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off<br />
flowing.</p>
<p>
BOOK XII</p>
<p>SO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus<br />
within the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately,<br />
nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in<br />
check longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug<br />
the trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and the<br />
rich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs<br />
to the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,<br />
and therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles<br />
nursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,<br />
the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of the<br />
Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were<br />
yet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth<br />
year, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own<br />
country- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, and<br />
they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida into<br />
the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus,<br />
and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm had<br />
fallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust.<br />
Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together and made<br />
them flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained the<br />
whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself,<br />
trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the<br />
foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with so<br />
much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,<br />
and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach of<br />
sand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the<br />
rivers back into their old courses.<br />
This was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as<br />
yet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its<br />
timbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed<br />
by the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of<br />
Hector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with<br />
the force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns<br />
fiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while these form solid<br />
wall and shower their javelins as they face him- his courage is all<br />
undaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of him; many a time<br />
does he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back<br />
as often as he does so- even so did Hector go about among the host<br />
exhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench.<br />
But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,<br />
for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross<br />
it, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above<br />
which there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had<br />
planted so close and strong as a defence against all who would<br />
assail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his<br />
chariot after him, but those who were on foot kept trying their very<br />
utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector and said, &#8220;Hector, and you<br />
other captains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us to<br />
try and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to<br />
cross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the<br />
wall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no<br />
use if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to<br />
harm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his<br />
anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see<br />
them perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally<br />
and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench<br />
there will be not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the<br />
tale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our<br />
horses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad<br />
in full armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans<br />
will not be able to withstand us.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in<br />
full armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw<br />
him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses<br />
over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the<br />
trench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves<br />
ready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went with<br />
Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the most<br />
determined to break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebriones<br />
was also joined with them as third in command, for Hector had left his<br />
chariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next company was<br />
led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and<br />
Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-<br />
Asius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed<br />
that comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe.<br />
Aeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons<br />
of Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of<br />
war. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus<br />
and Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he<br />
was far the best man of them all. These helped to array one another in<br />
their ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, for<br />
they felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that they<br />
should themselves now fall upon the ships.<br />
The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel of<br />
Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses and his<br />
esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with him<br />
towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in<br />
consequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting<br />
in his chariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened<br />
name had overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear of<br />
Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the left<br />
wing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with their<br />
chariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found the<br />
gates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar down- for the<br />
gatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades enter<br />
who might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he<br />
direct his horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for<br />
they felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that<br />
they should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at<br />
the gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons<br />
of the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of<br />
Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These stood<br />
before the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, that<br />
tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle with<br />
wind and rain- even so did these two men await the onset of great<br />
Asius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and by<br />
Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus,<br />
raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holding<br />
their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the two<br />
defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in<br />
the defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans<br />
were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help<br />
and being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates<br />
like two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men<br />
and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all round<br />
them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering of<br />
their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them- even so<br />
did the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weapons<br />
fell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their own<br />
prowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threw<br />
great stones at their assailants in defence of themselves their<br />
tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow<br />
which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down<br />
in sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons from the hands<br />
alike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great<br />
stones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismay<br />
cried aloud and smote his two thighs. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;of a<br />
truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argive<br />
heroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or<br />
bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside- they leave not<br />
the holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight for their<br />
little ones against all who would take them- even so these men, though<br />
they be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firm<br />
either to slay or be slain.&#8221;<br />
He spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then<br />
was to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were<br />
fighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to<br />
tell about all these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the<br />
stone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though<br />
they were, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who<br />
were defending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae<br />
kept on fighting with might and main.<br />
Thereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a<br />
spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him,<br />
for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so<br />
that the brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He<br />
then slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed<br />
Hippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear<br />
upon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang first upon<br />
Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face upwards on<br />
the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid<br />
them low one after the other.<br />
While they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the<br />
youths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the<br />
greater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to break<br />
through the wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the<br />
trench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from<br />
heaven when they had essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew<br />
skirting the left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake<br />
in its talons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake was<br />
still bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it<br />
struck the bird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird<br />
being in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host,<br />
and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were<br />
struck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing<br />
Jove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector<br />
and said, &#8220;Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke<br />
me, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,<br />
that one of the people should cross your will either in the field or<br />
at the council board; you would have them support you always:<br />
nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now go<br />
on to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if<br />
this soaring eagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous<br />
blood-red snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really<br />
sent as an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the<br />
trench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it<br />
home to her little ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; even<br />
though by a mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the<br />
Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return in<br />
good order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind us<br />
whom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thus<br />
would any seer who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by the<br />
people, read the portent.&#8221;<br />
Hector looked fiercely at him and said, &#8220;Polydamas, I like not of<br />
your reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.<br />
If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven<br />
robbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the<br />
counsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his<br />
head in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of<br />
wild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and<br />
whether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust<br />
rather in the counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals.<br />
There is one omen, and one only- that a man should fight for his<br />
country. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the<br />
ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you<br />
are not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would<br />
talk others over from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my<br />
spear.&#8221;<br />
With these words he led the way, and the others followed after<br />
with a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the<br />
blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust<br />
down towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and<br />
gave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their<br />
own might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through<br />
the great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from<br />
the walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the<br />
buttresses, which the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order<br />
to support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure of<br />
breaking through the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of<br />
giving ground; they still fenced the battlements with their shields of<br />
ox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any<br />
came below the wall.<br />
The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the<br />
Achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any<br />
one whom they saw to be remiss. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;Argives one<br />
and all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in<br />
which all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you very<br />
well know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight<br />
towards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press<br />
forward and keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian<br />
Jove the lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and<br />
drive them back towards the city.&#8221;<br />
Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.<br />
As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter&#8217;s day, when Jove is minded<br />
to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the<br />
wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of<br />
the high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy<br />
plains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the<br />
forelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come<br />
rolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is<br />
wrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even thus<br />
thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some<br />
thrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and<br />
the whole wall was in an uproar.<br />
Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down<br />
the gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon<br />
against the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.<br />
Before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had<br />
beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had<br />
made fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in<br />
front of him, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of<br />
the wilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will<br />
dare break even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the<br />
sheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks<br />
with dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the<br />
fold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep<br />
and carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was<br />
Sarpedon fain to attack the wall and break down its battlements.<br />
Then he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus, &#8220;Glaucus, why in Lycia<br />
do we receive especial honour as regards our place at table? Why are<br />
the choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why do<br />
men look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large<br />
estate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawns<br />
and wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at<br />
the head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that<br />
one may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land<br />
and drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well and<br />
are ever at the front in battle.&#8217; My good friend, if, when we were<br />
once out of this fight, we could escape old age and death<br />
thenceforward and for ever, I should neither press forward myself<br />
nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over<br />
our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward and<br />
either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.&#8221;<br />
Glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host of<br />
Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for<br />
it was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing<br />
destruction with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain<br />
to support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the<br />
fray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them;<br />
but he could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an<br />
uproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering<br />
of gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had<br />
been closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break<br />
their way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a<br />
message to Ajax. &#8220;Run, good Thootes,&#8221; said and call Ajax, or better<br />
still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;<br />
the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought<br />
desperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let<br />
them come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer<br />
the famous bowman come with him.&#8221;<br />
The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall<br />
of the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, &#8220;Sirs,<br />
princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him<br />
for a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or it<br />
will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are<br />
upon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have<br />
too much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax son of<br />
Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him.&#8221;<br />
Great Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke to<br />
the son of Oileus. &#8220;Ajax,&#8221; said he, &#8220;do you two, yourself and brave<br />
Lycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their<br />
hardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but I<br />
will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help they<br />
need.&#8221;<br />
With this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by<br />
the same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer&#8217;s bow. They<br />
went along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where<br />
Menestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave<br />
captains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements as<br />
it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising<br />
the battle-cry aloud.<br />
First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of<br />
Sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the<br />
battlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one<br />
who is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two<br />
hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing<br />
Epicles&#8217; four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head were<br />
crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he were<br />
diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the<br />
brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack the wall. He<br />
saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus<br />
leave off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some of<br />
the Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was<br />
stung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave<br />
off fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and<br />
hit him. He drew his spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong after<br />
it with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized<br />
the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it an gave<br />
way together, and a breach was made through which many might pass.<br />
Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him<br />
with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,<br />
but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by<br />
the ships&#8217; sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his<br />
shield, but the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled<br />
him back that he could come on no further. He therefore retired a<br />
little space from the battlement, yet without losing all his ground,<br />
for he still thought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round<br />
and shouted to the brave Lycians saying, &#8220;Lycians, why do you thus<br />
fail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a<br />
way to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the<br />
more there are of us the better.&#8221;<br />
The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who<br />
was their counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their<br />
men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle<br />
between them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force<br />
their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from<br />
the wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods<br />
in hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in<br />
common, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere<br />
strip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of<br />
contention, and they beat one another&#8217;s round shields for their<br />
possession. Many a man&#8217;s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as<br />
he turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struck<br />
clean through their shields; the wall and battlements were<br />
everywhere deluged with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans.<br />
But even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held<br />
on; and as some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance<br />
and sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitiful<br />
earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenly<br />
between them till the time came when Jove gave the greater glory to<br />
Hector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the wall of the<br />
Achaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, &#8220;Up, Trojans,<br />
break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their ships.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at<br />
the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with<br />
sharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just<br />
outside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;<br />
two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it<br />
from the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it<br />
quite easily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it<br />
light for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram&#8217;s fleece with one hand and<br />
finds it no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and<br />
drive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and so<br />
firmly set. These doors were double and high, and were kept closed<br />
by two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had got<br />
close up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow might<br />
gain in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his whole<br />
weight against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside<br />
by reason of its great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound,<br />
the bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the<br />
other the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hector<br />
leaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. The<br />
gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had tow<br />
spears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as he<br />
flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. Then he<br />
turned round towards the Trojans and called on them to scale the wall,<br />
and they did as he bade them- some of them at once climbing over the<br />
wall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fled<br />
panic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.</p>
<p>
BOOK XIII</p>
<p>NOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the<br />
ships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen<br />
eyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace,<br />
the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who<br />
live on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer<br />
turned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any<br />
of the immortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans.<br />
But King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking<br />
admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded<br />
Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and<br />
the ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken<br />
his place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome<br />
by the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.<br />
Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as<br />
he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath<br />
the tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the<br />
fourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden<br />
palace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,<br />
he yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all<br />
flying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his<br />
gold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way<br />
over the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew<br />
their lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the<br />
deep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before his<br />
chariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car<br />
was not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him<br />
to the ships of the Achaeans.<br />
Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway<br />
between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the<br />
earthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them<br />
their ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold<br />
which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay<br />
there in that place until their lord should return. This done he<br />
went his way to the host of the Achaeans.<br />
Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a<br />
storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising<br />
the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the<br />
Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there.<br />
Meanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on<br />
the Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the<br />
form and voice of Calchas.<br />
First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,<br />
and said, &#8220;Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you<br />
will put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am<br />
not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will<br />
be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them<br />
in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where<br />
furious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is<br />
leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it<br />
into your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do<br />
the like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though<br />
he be inspired by Jove himself.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck<br />
both of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring.<br />
He made their legs light and active, as also their hands and their<br />
feet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some<br />
sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the<br />
plain, even so did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into<br />
the air and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the<br />
first to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to<br />
Ajax son of Telamon, &#8220;Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on<br />
Olympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard<br />
by our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew<br />
him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods<br />
are soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more<br />
fiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eager<br />
for the fray.&#8221;<br />
And Ajax son of Telamon answered, &#8220;I too feel my hands grasp my<br />
spear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble;<br />
I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in<br />
single combat.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with<br />
which the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused<br />
the Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at<br />
once by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had<br />
got over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as<br />
they beheld them, for they made sure that they should not escape<br />
destruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among<br />
them and urged their battalions to the front.<br />
First he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and<br />
Thoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors;<br />
all did he exhort. &#8220;Shame on you young Argives,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;it was<br />
on your prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not<br />
with might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the<br />
Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent<br />
which I had never thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they,<br />
who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and<br />
wolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannot<br />
defend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment<br />
face the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far from<br />
their city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice of<br />
our leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in their<br />
discontent care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being<br />
slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause<br />
of our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no<br />
reason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal,<br />
for the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus<br />
remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our whole army. I blame no<br />
man for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am<br />
indignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soon<br />
become even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of<br />
his own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight is extreme.<br />
Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through the<br />
gates and the strong bolt that held them.&#8221;<br />
Thus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them<br />
on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men,<br />
of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make<br />
light if they went among them, for they were the picked men of all<br />
those who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans.<br />
They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to<br />
buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on<br />
their gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward,<br />
so closely seffied were they; the spears they brandished in their<br />
strong hands were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.<br />
The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head<br />
pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of<br />
some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the<br />
foundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain,<br />
and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an<br />
uproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level<br />
ground, but then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easily<br />
did Hector for a while seem as though he would career through the<br />
tents and ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his<br />
murderous course; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when<br />
he reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with<br />
swords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them so<br />
that he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to the<br />
Trojans, &#8220;Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close<br />
combat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall against<br />
me, but they will not check me for long; they will give ground<br />
before me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno,<br />
has indeed inspired my onset.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus<br />
son of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with<br />
his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly<br />
forward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit<br />
the broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the<br />
spear broke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover<br />
Deiphobus had seen it coming and had held his shield well away from<br />
him. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at<br />
having failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. He<br />
turned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he<br />
had left behind in his tent.<br />
The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into<br />
the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, to<br />
wit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the<br />
Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste a<br />
bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he<br />
had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,<br />
dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his own<br />
sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear<br />
which he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an<br />
ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountain<br />
beacon, and its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to the<br />
ground. Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing<br />
harshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to strip<br />
him of his armour; but as he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with<br />
a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit<br />
Amphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was<br />
coming into battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as he<br />
fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to take<br />
Amphimachus&#8217;s helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax<br />
threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all<br />
over in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of<br />
his shield with such force as to drive him back from the two<br />
corpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,<br />
captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of the<br />
Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by<br />
Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in<br />
their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the ground<br />
in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, and<br />
strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from<br />
the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling<br />
over the crowd as though it had been a ball, till fell in the dust<br />
at Hector&#8217;s feet.<br />
Neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should<br />
have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the<br />
Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the<br />
Trojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who<br />
had just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His<br />
fellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given<br />
orders to the physicians went on to his tent, for he was still<br />
thirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice<br />
of Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and<br />
high Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though he were a<br />
god. &#8220;Idomeneus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now<br />
become of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used to<br />
threaten the Trojans?&#8221;<br />
And Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, &#8220;Thoas, no one, so<br />
far as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back<br />
neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jove<br />
that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you,<br />
Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if you<br />
see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do<br />
their utmost.&#8221;<br />
To this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, &#8220;Idomeneus,<br />
may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten<br />
upon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour<br />
and go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,<br />
though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage from<br />
companionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest.&#8221;<br />
Therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and<br />
Idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped<br />
his two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of<br />
Saturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a sign to<br />
mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armour<br />
gleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he<br />
was still near his tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) and<br />
Idomeneus said<br />
&#8220;Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left<br />
the field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting<br />
you? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had<br />
far rather fight than stay in my tent.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Idomeneus,&#8221; answered Meriones, &#8220;I come for a spear, if I can find<br />
one in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the<br />
shield of Deiphobus.&#8221;<br />
And Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, &#8220;You will find one<br />
spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of<br />
my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am<br />
not one to keep my enemy at arm&#8217;s length; therefore I have spears,<br />
bossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.&#8221;<br />
Then Meriones said, &#8220;I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils<br />
taken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all<br />
times valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my<br />
own among the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do<br />
not know how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.&#8221;<br />
Idomeneus answered, &#8220;I know you for a brave man: you need not tell<br />
me. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-<br />
and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it<br />
comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change<br />
colour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps<br />
shifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart<br />
beats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of<br />
his teeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on<br />
finding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into<br />
action- if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one<br />
could make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck<br />
by a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind,<br />
in your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or<br />
belly as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks.<br />
But let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill<br />
spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.&#8221;<br />
On this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a<br />
spear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great<br />
deeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his<br />
son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even<br />
into the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm<br />
themselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will<br />
not listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory to<br />
one side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains<br />
of men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was<br />
first to speak. &#8220;Son of Deucalion,&#8221; said he, &#8220;where would you have<br />
us begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on<br />
the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?&#8221;<br />
Idomeneus answered, &#8220;There are others to defend the centre- the<br />
two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans,<br />
and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son<br />
of Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to<br />
vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of<br />
Saturn fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son<br />
of Telamon will yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the<br />
grain of Ceres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would<br />
not yield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness<br />
of foot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the<br />
left wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory<br />
to some other, or he to us.&#8221;<br />
Meriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the<br />
part of the host which Idomeneus had named.<br />
Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,<br />
him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted<br />
and made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight<br />
raged under the ships&#8217; sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle<br />
upon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it<br />
into a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might<br />
and main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout<br />
the host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which<br />
they bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their<br />
fresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined<br />
battle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could<br />
take pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it without<br />
being dismayed.<br />
Thus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal<br />
heroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to<br />
Hector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did<br />
not mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and<br />
only wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the<br />
other hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having come up<br />
from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing them<br />
vanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with Jove. Both<br />
were of the same race and country, but Jove was elder born and knew<br />
more, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but in<br />
the likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout their<br />
host. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle,<br />
that none could unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, to<br />
the failing of men&#8217;s knees beneath them.<br />
And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,<br />
called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he<br />
leaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,<br />
who had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra<br />
the fairest of Priam&#8217;s daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts<br />
of wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would<br />
drive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam<br />
had given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on<br />
the strength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a<br />
spear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did<br />
not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell<br />
heavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying,<br />
&#8220;Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire more<br />
than I do you, if you indeed perform what you have promised Priam<br />
son of Dardanus in return for his daughter. We too will make you an<br />
offer; we will give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus,<br />
and will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the<br />
goodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me,<br />
that we may make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we<br />
will not be hard upon you about gifts of wooing.&#8221;<br />
With this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick<br />
of the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front<br />
of his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he<br />
could feel their &#8216;breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike<br />
down Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his<br />
spear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean<br />
through it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights<br />
have felled for ship&#8217;s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-<br />
even thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,<br />
grinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His<br />
charioteer was struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses<br />
round and escape: thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his<br />
body with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and<br />
the spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and<br />
Antilochus great Nestor&#8217;s son, drove his horses from the Trojans to<br />
the Achaeans.<br />
Deiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and<br />
took aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and<br />
avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a<br />
shield of oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He<br />
crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the<br />
shield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in<br />
vain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son<br />
of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff,<br />
and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried<br />
with a loud voice saying, &#8220;Of a truth Asius has not fallen<br />
unavenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades,<br />
strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble<br />
Antilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him<br />
forget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and<br />
covered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,<br />
Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away<br />
groaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He<br />
kept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the<br />
darkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day<br />
from the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was<br />
son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia<br />
who was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her<br />
generation in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore<br />
the bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune lay<br />
low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his<br />
strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one<br />
side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus<br />
struck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail<br />
that had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang<br />
harshly as the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground,<br />
and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the<br />
butt-end of the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.<br />
Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,<br />
&#8220;Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now<br />
that we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight<br />
with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten<br />
man am I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler<br />
in Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion;<br />
Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and my<br />
ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, your<br />
father, and the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go<br />
back and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the<br />
challenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch<br />
Aeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been<br />
aggrieved with Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not<br />
give him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said,<br />
&#8220;Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship,<br />
help me now to defend the body of your sister&#8217;s husband; come with<br />
me to the rescue of Alcathous, who being husband to your sister<br />
brought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus<br />
has slain him.&#8221;<br />
With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in<br />
pursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus<br />
was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his<br />
ground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming<br />
of a great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand<br />
upright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in<br />
his eagerness to defend himself against hounds and men- even so did<br />
famed Idomeneus hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas.<br />
He cried aloud to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus,<br />
Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers-<br />
&#8220;Hither my friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and leave me not single-handed- I go<br />
in great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a<br />
redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of<br />
youth when a man&#8217;s strength is greatest; if I was of the same age as<br />
he is and in my present mind, either he or I should soon bear away the<br />
prize of victory<br />
On this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on<br />
shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking<br />
towards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the<br />
Trojans along with himself, and the people followed them as sheep<br />
follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been<br />
feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad- even so was the<br />
heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.<br />
Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of<br />
Alcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about<br />
their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the<br />
press of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers<br />
of Mars, outxied every one in their desire to hack at each other<br />
with sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on<br />
the lookout and avoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas&#8217; strong<br />
hand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile<br />
smote Oenomaus in the middle of his belly, and broke the plate of<br />
his corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched the<br />
earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.<br />
Idomeneus drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him of<br />
the rest of his armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon<br />
him: moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he<br />
could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recover<br />
his own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him;<br />
therefore, though he still defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his<br />
heavy feet could not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus<br />
aimed a spear at him as he was retreating slowly from the field, for<br />
his bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again he<br />
missed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear went<br />
through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of his<br />
hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.<br />
Grim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,<br />
for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden<br />
clouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting,<br />
forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously<br />
about the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but<br />
Meriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so<br />
that the visored helmet fell from his hand and came ringing down<br />
upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew<br />
the spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men.<br />
Then Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around his<br />
waist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horses<br />
that were standing in the rear of the fight with the chariot and their<br />
driver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain,<br />
with the blood flowing from his arm.<br />
The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven<br />
without ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and<br />
struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him;<br />
his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along<br />
with him, and death, life&#8217;s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied<br />
his chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was<br />
turning round. He laid open the vein that runs all the way up the back<br />
to the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout its whole<br />
course, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his<br />
hands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and<br />
stripped the armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as<br />
he did so. The Trojans came about him on every side and struck his<br />
broad and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune<br />
stood guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly<br />
round him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the<br />
thick of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it<br />
in every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a distance or<br />
to fight him hand to hand.<br />
As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son<br />
of Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the<br />
middle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for<br />
he grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the<br />
spear stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus&#8217;s shield, while<br />
the other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of<br />
his men, but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway<br />
between the private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly<br />
painful to wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he<br />
writhed convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain<br />
herdsmen have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.<br />
Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long,<br />
till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes<br />
were veiled in darkness.<br />
Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting<br />
him on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his<br />
head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were<br />
fighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his<br />
feet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.<br />
On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,<br />
brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two<br />
attacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with his<br />
spear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit<br />
the breastplate of Menelaus&#8217;s corslet, but the arrow glanced from<br />
off it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a<br />
threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds<br />
and shaken by the shovel- even so did the arrow glance off and<br />
recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded the hand<br />
with which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through his<br />
hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreated<br />
under cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side- for the<br />
spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the hand<br />
carefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had with him.<br />
Pisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring him<br />
on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. When<br />
the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned<br />
aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of<br />
brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the<br />
spear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of<br />
victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and<br />
sprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with<br />
its long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under<br />
his shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the<br />
peak of Menelaus&#8217;s crested helmet just under the crest itself, and<br />
Menelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead,<br />
just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two<br />
gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards<br />
to the ground, and Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his<br />
armour, and vaunted over him saying, &#8220;Even thus shall you Trojans<br />
leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle<br />
though you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame<br />
which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are,<br />
you feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated<br />
hospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my wedded<br />
wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,<br />
and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A<br />
day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O father<br />
Jove, you, who they say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, and<br />
from whom all things that befall us do proceed, how can you thus<br />
favour the Trojans- men so proud and overweening, that they are<br />
never tired of fighting? All things pall after a while- sleep, love,<br />
sweet song, and stately dance- still these are things of which a man<br />
would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of<br />
battle that the Trojans are insatiate.&#8221;<br />
So saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body<br />
of Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged<br />
himself among those who were in the front of the fight.<br />
Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come<br />
to fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home<br />
again. He struck the middle of Menelaus&#8217;s shield with his spear but<br />
could not pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his<br />
men, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But<br />
Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the<br />
field, and hit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone<br />
through and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down<br />
where he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades,<br />
stretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth with<br />
the blood that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended<br />
him with all due care; they raised him into his chariot, and bore<br />
him sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also with him<br />
weeping bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his dead<br />
son to life again.<br />
Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host<br />
when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in<br />
order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son<br />
of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in<br />
Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it<br />
would be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had<br />
often told him that he must either stay at home and die of a<br />
terrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of<br />
the Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine<br />
the Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time to<br />
escape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the<br />
jaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was<br />
enshrouded in the darkness of death.<br />
Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had<br />
not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc<br />
of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long<br />
would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them<br />
on and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first<br />
forced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking<br />
through the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the<br />
ships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the<br />
wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most<br />
fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the<br />
Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans<br />
could hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor<br />
could they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The<br />
chosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son<br />
of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias:<br />
Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while<br />
Medon and staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon<br />
was bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace<br />
away from his own country, for he had killed the brother of his<br />
stepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the<br />
son of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the<br />
Phthians, and defended the ships along with the Boeotians.<br />
Ajax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of<br />
Telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the<br />
plough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat<br />
steams upwards from about the roots of their horns- nothing but the<br />
yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the<br />
end of the field- even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to<br />
shoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son of<br />
Telamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome with<br />
sweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close after the son<br />
of Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-hand<br />
fight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, neither<br />
had they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armed<br />
with bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showered<br />
their missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans. The others,<br />
therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight with<br />
the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot from behind,<br />
under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for the<br />
arrows threw them into confusion.<br />
The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the<br />
ships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently<br />
said to Hector, &#8220;Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice.<br />
Because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you<br />
think that you must therefore excel others in counsel; but you<br />
cannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man<br />
an excellent soldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singer<br />
and player on the lyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wise<br />
understanding of which men reap fruit to the saving of many, and he<br />
himself knows more about it than any one; therefore I will say what<br />
I think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circle<br />
of fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some of<br />
them stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scattered<br />
and outnumbered near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call your<br />
chieftains round you, that we may advise together whether to fall<br />
now upon the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory,<br />
or to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear<br />
that the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for<br />
there is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,<br />
and who will not hold aloof much longer.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang<br />
in full armour from his chariot and said, &#8220;Polydamas, gather the<br />
chieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at<br />
once when I have given them their orders.&#8221;<br />
He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud<br />
cry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When<br />
they heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the<br />
excellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,<br />
looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of<br />
Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he<br />
could no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns<br />
of the Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others had<br />
been also stricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing of<br />
the dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen,<br />
cheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him and<br />
upbraided him. &#8220;Paris,&#8221; said he, &#8220;evil-hearted Paris, fair to see<br />
but woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King<br />
Helenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus?<br />
Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!&#8221;<br />
Alexandrus answered, &#8220;Hector, why find fault when there is no one to<br />
find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather<br />
than this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about<br />
me. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we<br />
have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades<br />
about whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone<br />
have left the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son<br />
of Saturn saved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would<br />
have us go, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find<br />
us fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can do<br />
more than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.&#8221;<br />
With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went<br />
towards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about<br />
Cebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes,<br />
Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from<br />
fertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. Then<br />
Jove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like the blasts of some<br />
fierce wind that strike earth in the van of a thunderstorm- they<br />
buffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty are the great<br />
waves that come crashing in one after the other upon the shore with<br />
their arching heads all crested with foam- even so did rank behind<br />
rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armour follow their leaders<br />
onward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderous<br />
Mars, with his round shield before him- his shield of ox-hides covered<br />
with plates of bronze- and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He<br />
kept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction,<br />
making trial of the ranks to see if they would give way be him, but he<br />
could not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to<br />
stride out and challenge him. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;draw near; why do<br />
you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent<br />
soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your<br />
heart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have bands<br />
that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken<br />
and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and<br />
all the gods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than<br />
hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your<br />
city.&#8221;<br />
As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and<br />
the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But<br />
Hector answered, &#8220;Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I<br />
were as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with<br />
Queen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with<br />
Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the<br />
destruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare<br />
abide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our<br />
hounds and birds of prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall<br />
by the ships of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With these words he led the way and the others followed after with a<br />
cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives<br />
on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their<br />
prowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan<br />
chieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to<br />
the brightness of Jove&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>
BOOK XIV</p>
<p>NESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not<br />
escape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, &#8220;What, noble<br />
Machaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our<br />
ships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over<br />
your wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted<br />
blood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and<br />
see what it is all about.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was<br />
lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken<br />
his father&#8217;s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and<br />
as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who,<br />
now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the<br />
Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves<br />
are dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the<br />
fierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and<br />
set neither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down<br />
from heaven to determine them- even so did the old man ponder<br />
whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of<br />
Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;<br />
but meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and the<br />
hard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another<br />
with their swords and spears.<br />
The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son<br />
of Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for<br />
theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,<br />
being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,<br />
while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of<br />
the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the<br />
ships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed<br />
the ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole<br />
opening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,<br />
leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in<br />
great anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with<br />
dismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, &#8220;Nestor son of Neleus, honour<br />
to the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I<br />
fear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among<br />
the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired<br />
our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all<br />
coming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in anger<br />
with me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.&#8221;<br />
Then Nestor knight of Gerene answered, &#8220;It is indeed as you say;<br />
it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders<br />
from on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we<br />
relied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The<br />
Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look<br />
where you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the<br />
Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass and the<br />
battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any<br />
use, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going into<br />
battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded.&#8221;<br />
And King Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed<br />
fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench<br />
has served us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they<br />
deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I<br />
see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish<br />
ingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to<br />
defend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like<br />
honour with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand<br />
and foot. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down<br />
the ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us<br />
make them fast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the<br />
fall of night- if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting;<br />
we may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in<br />
flying ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly<br />
and be saved than be caught and killed.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, &#8220;Son of Atreus, what are<br />
you talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and<br />
baser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a<br />
life of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us<br />
perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win<br />
which we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some<br />
other of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give<br />
good counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives<br />
should ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgement<br />
utterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw<br />
down our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus<br />
play further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be<br />
ruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships<br />
being drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep<br />
turning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain,<br />
would be our destruction.&#8221;<br />
Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.<br />
I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into<br />
the sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,<br />
can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.&#8221;<br />
Then said Diomed, &#8220;Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if<br />
you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger<br />
than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies<br />
buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,<br />
Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was<br />
the knight Oeneus, my father&#8217;s father, and he was the most valiant<br />
of them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as<br />
Jove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married<br />
into the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,<br />
for he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with much<br />
orchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled<br />
all the Argives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves have<br />
heard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say well<br />
despise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth.<br />
I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though<br />
we be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the<br />
range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we<br />
have already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their<br />
spleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,<br />
King Agamemnon leading the way.<br />
Meanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in<br />
the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon&#8217;s right hand in his own<br />
and said, &#8220;Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he<br />
sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-<br />
may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the<br />
blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the<br />
princes and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon<br />
the plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents<br />
towards their city.&#8221;<br />
With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to<br />
the plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine<br />
or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,<br />
and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war<br />
and do battle without ceasing.<br />
Juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of<br />
Olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at<br />
once her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither<br />
amid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the<br />
topmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set<br />
herself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed<br />
that it would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich<br />
attire, in the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and<br />
wish to embrace her. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless<br />
sleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses.<br />
She went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made<br />
her, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a<br />
secret key so that no other god could open them. Here she entered<br />
and closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her<br />
fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil,<br />
ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were so<br />
much as shaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded<br />
the universe of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her<br />
delicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks that<br />
flowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put<br />
on the wondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with<br />
consummate art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; she<br />
fastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself<br />
with a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her<br />
earrings, three brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully,<br />
through the pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veil<br />
over her head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she<br />
had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room<br />
and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. &#8220;My dear child,&#8221; said<br />
she, &#8220;will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse me<br />
because you are angry at my being on the Danaan side, while you are on<br />
the Trojan?&#8221;<br />
Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus answered, &#8220;Juno, august queen of goddesses,<br />
daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for<br />
at once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.&#8221;<br />
Then Juno told her a lying tale and said, &#8220;I want you to endow me<br />
with some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all<br />
things mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world&#8217;s end<br />
to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:<br />
they received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,<br />
having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in<br />
the depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I<br />
may make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so<br />
angry that they have not slept with one another this long while; if<br />
I can bring them round and restore them to one another&#8217;s embraces,<br />
they will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.&#8221;<br />
Thereon laughter-loving Venus said, &#8220;I cannot and must not refuse<br />
you, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered<br />
girdle into which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and<br />
that sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most<br />
prudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, &#8220;Take this girdle<br />
wherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will<br />
wear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not be<br />
bootless.&#8221;<br />
When she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the<br />
girdle in her bosom.<br />
Venus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down<br />
from the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair<br />
Emathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the<br />
Thracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever<br />
setting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the,<br />
waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas.<br />
There she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand,<br />
saying, &#8220;Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if<br />
you ever did me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I<br />
shall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove&#8217;s keen eyes for me<br />
in slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you<br />
a beautiful golden seat, that can never fall to pieces; my<br />
clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it a<br />
footstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table.&#8221;<br />
Then Sleep answered, &#8220;Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of<br />
mighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without<br />
compunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of<br />
them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep<br />
unless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what<br />
you asked me, on the day when Jove&#8217;s mighty son Hercules set sail from<br />
Ilius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I<br />
suffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid<br />
him to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set<br />
the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took<br />
him to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was<br />
furious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the<br />
house; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have<br />
flung me down through space into the sea where I should never have<br />
been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods<br />
protected me. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in<br />
spite of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything to<br />
displease Night. And now you are again asking me to do something on<br />
which I cannot venture.&#8221;<br />
And Juno said, &#8220;Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into<br />
your head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,<br />
as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the<br />
youngest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom<br />
you have always wanted to marry.&#8221;<br />
Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, &#8220;Then swear it<br />
to me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the<br />
bounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all<br />
the gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and<br />
see that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces-<br />
Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry.&#8221;<br />
Juno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of<br />
the nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had<br />
completed her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist<br />
and sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them.<br />
Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and<br />
Lectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the<br />
trees of the forest soughed under the going of their feet. Here<br />
Sleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty<br />
pine-tree- the tallest that reared its head towards heaven on all Ida.<br />
He hid himself behind the branches and sat there in the semblance of<br />
the sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis<br />
by the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the<br />
topmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon<br />
her. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the same<br />
passionate desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyed<br />
each other&#8217;s embraces, and slept with one another without their dear<br />
parents knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, &#8220;What<br />
do you want that you have come hither from Olympus- and that too<br />
with neither chariot nor horses to convey you?&#8221;<br />
Then Juno told him a lying tale and said, &#8220;I am going to the world&#8217;s<br />
end, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother<br />
Tethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and<br />
brought me up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between<br />
them: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have<br />
not slept with one another this long time. The horses that will take<br />
me over land and sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of<br />
many-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on purpose to<br />
consult you. I was afraid you might be angry with me later on, if I<br />
went to the house of Oceanus without letting you know.&#8221;<br />
And Jove said, &#8220;Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your<br />
visit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love<br />
and to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so<br />
overpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at<br />
this moment for yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of<br />
Ixion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with<br />
Danae the daintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the<br />
famed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore<br />
me Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes<br />
by whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele became<br />
mother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres<br />
again, and lovely Leto, and yourself- but with none of these was I<br />
ever so much enamoured as I now am with you.&#8221;<br />
Juno again answered him with a lying tale. &#8220;Most dread son of<br />
Saturn,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;what are you talking about? Would you have us<br />
enjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can<br />
be seen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping<br />
together, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when<br />
I had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside your<br />
house again; but if you are so minded, there is a room which your<br />
son Vulcan has made me, and he has given it good strong doors; if<br />
you would so have it, let us go thither and lie down.&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;Juno, you need not be afraid that either god<br />
or man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense<br />
golden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams<br />
shall not see through it.&#8221;<br />
With this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;<br />
whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with<br />
dew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that<br />
it raised them well above the ground. Here they laid themselves down<br />
and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which<br />
there fell glittering dew-drops.<br />
Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the<br />
crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his<br />
spouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the<br />
Achaeans, to tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake.<br />
When he had found him he said, &#8220;Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans<br />
with a will, and give them victory though it be only for a short<br />
time while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet<br />
slumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to bed with her.&#8221;<br />
Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,<br />
leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted<br />
forward among the first ranks and shouted saying, &#8220;Argives, shall we<br />
let Hector son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and<br />
covering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall now<br />
do, seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get<br />
on very well without him if we keep each other in heart and stand by<br />
one another. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each<br />
take the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our<br />
helmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; will<br />
lead you on, and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to<br />
hold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a small<br />
shield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger one for<br />
himself.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of<br />
Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the<br />
others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges<br />
of armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse<br />
to the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armour they<br />
marched on with Neptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped<br />
his terrible sword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe to<br />
him who comes across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear<br />
and keep away from it.<br />
Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune<br />
and Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and<br />
Neptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces<br />
met; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the<br />
Achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when<br />
driven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest<br />
fire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor<br />
does the wind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the<br />
tops of when it is blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout<br />
which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.<br />
Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards<br />
him, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands<br />
passed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his<br />
silver-studded sword- and these protected his body. Hector was angry<br />
that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under<br />
cover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon<br />
struck him with a stone, of which there were many lying about under<br />
the men&#8217;s feet as they fought- brought there to give support to the<br />
ships&#8217; sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them<br />
and struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; the<br />
blow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. As<br />
an oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of father<br />
Jove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone- no man can help<br />
being dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a<br />
very awful thing- even so did Hector fall to earth and bite the<br />
dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield and helmet were<br />
made fast about his body, and his bronze armour rang about him.<br />
The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,<br />
hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,<br />
but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and<br />
covered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain<br />
of the Lycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not<br />
one who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over<br />
him to cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore<br />
him away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting<br />
for him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;<br />
these then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain.<br />
When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of<br />
Immortal Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on<br />
the ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed<br />
again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited<br />
blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again<br />
closed in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.<br />
When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and<br />
set upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus<br />
began by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his<br />
spear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding<br />
cattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came<br />
up to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce<br />
fight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas<br />
son of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of<br />
Areilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right through<br />
his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.<br />
Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, &#8220;Again I take it that the<br />
spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of<br />
Panthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him<br />
for a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.&#8221;<br />
The Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon<br />
was more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he<br />
aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself<br />
by swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for<br />
heaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head<br />
springs from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed<br />
both the tendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and<br />
nostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could do<br />
so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, &#8220;Think, Polydamas, and<br />
tell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing as<br />
Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may<br />
be, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like him.&#8221;<br />
But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.<br />
Acamas then bestrode his brother&#8217;s body and wounded Promachus the<br />
Boeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother&#8217;s<br />
body away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, &#8220;Argive archers,<br />
braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only,<br />
but some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how<br />
Promachus now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother&#8217;s<br />
blood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful<br />
if he leaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.&#8221;<br />
His taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged<br />
than any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand<br />
his ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master<br />
Phorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth<br />
than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos<br />
now wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball<br />
from its socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of<br />
the neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him.<br />
Peneleos then drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both<br />
head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear<br />
still sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though it<br />
had been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over<br />
them as he did so. &#8220;Trojans,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;bid the father and mother<br />
of noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife<br />
also of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the<br />
coming of her dear husband- when we Argives return with our ships from<br />
Troy.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to<br />
see whither he might fly for safety.<br />
Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the<br />
Argives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the<br />
earthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was<br />
first to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.<br />
Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys<br />
and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son<br />
of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,<br />
and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among<br />
them; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where<br />
he had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of<br />
Oileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he<br />
to pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.</p>
<p>
BOOK XV</p>
<p>BUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set<br />
stakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans<br />
made a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.<br />
Jove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with<br />
golden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the<br />
Trojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others<br />
driving them pell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst.<br />
He saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered round<br />
him, gasping for breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for<br />
it was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.<br />
The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on<br />
Juno. &#8220;I see, Juno,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you mischief- making trickster, that<br />
your cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout<br />
of his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will<br />
be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not<br />
remember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two<br />
anvils on to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold<br />
which none might break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds.<br />
All the gods in Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach you<br />
to set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and<br />
hurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to<br />
earth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessant<br />
anxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had<br />
spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning the<br />
tempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mighty<br />
labours I brought him back again to Argos. I would remind you of<br />
this that you may learn to leave off being so deceitful, and<br />
discover how much you are likely to gain by the embraces out of<br />
which you have come here to trick me.&#8221;<br />
Juno trembled as he spoke, and said, &#8220;May heaven above and earth<br />
below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this<br />
is the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also<br />
by your own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I<br />
could never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing<br />
Hector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing of<br />
mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see the<br />
Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I should<br />
tell him to do as you bid him.&#8221;<br />
The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, &#8220;If you, Juno, were<br />
always to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, like<br />
it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,<br />
then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the<br />
rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,<br />
that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell<br />
Neptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may<br />
send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will<br />
thus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in<br />
confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.<br />
Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and<br />
Hector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many<br />
warriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill<br />
Hector to avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about<br />
that the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till<br />
they fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not<br />
stay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have<br />
accomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise<br />
I made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and<br />
besought me to give him honour.&#8221;<br />
Juno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great<br />
Olympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast<br />
continents, and he says to himself, &#8220;Now I will be here, or there,&#8221;<br />
and he would have all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno<br />
wing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in among the<br />
gods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her they<br />
all of them came up to her, and held out their cups to her by way of<br />
greeting. She let the others be, but took the cup offered her by<br />
lovely Themis, who was first to come running up to her. &#8220;Juno,&#8221; said<br />
she, &#8220;why are you here? And you seem troubled- has your husband the<br />
son of Saturn been frightening you?&#8221;<br />
And Juno answered, &#8220;Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what<br />
a proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to<br />
table, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs<br />
which he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be<br />
angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting now.&#8221;<br />
On this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the<br />
house of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with<br />
care, and she spoke up in a rage. &#8220;Fools that we are,&#8221; she cried,<br />
&#8220;to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to<br />
him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and<br />
cares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other<br />
of the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may<br />
choose to send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of<br />
them already, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the man<br />
whom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns<br />
himself to be.&#8221;<br />
When he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of<br />
his hands, and said in anger, &#8220;Do not blame me, you gods that dwell in<br />
heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of<br />
my son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove&#8217;s lightning<br />
and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,<br />
while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to<br />
still more fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals,<br />
had not Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her<br />
seat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the<br />
shield from his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his<br />
strong hand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, &#8220;Madman,<br />
you are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all<br />
judgement and understanding; have you not heard what Juno has said<br />
on coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish<br />
to go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back<br />
sick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to<br />
all us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans<br />
to themselves; he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip<br />
us up one after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside<br />
your anger for the death of your son; better men than he have either<br />
been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect<br />
every one&#8217;s whole family.&#8221;<br />
With these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno<br />
called Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. &#8220;Jove,&#8221;<br />
she said to them, &#8220;desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when<br />
you have seen him you are to do as he may then bid you.&#8221;<br />
Thereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and<br />
Apollo made all haste on their way. When they reached<br />
many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated<br />
on topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his head as<br />
with a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was pleased with<br />
them for having been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had given<br />
them.<br />
He spoke to Iris first. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;fleet Iris, tell King<br />
Neptune what I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off<br />
fighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down into the<br />
sea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well<br />
whether he is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack<br />
him. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid<br />
to set himself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other<br />
gods stand in awe.&#8221;<br />
Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or<br />
snowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas,<br />
even so did she wing her way till she came close up to the great<br />
shaker of the earth. Then she said, &#8220;I have come, O dark-haired king<br />
that holds the world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove.<br />
He bids you leave off fighting, and either join the company of the<br />
gods or go down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and<br />
disobey him, he says he will come down here and fight you. He would<br />
have you keep out of his reach, for he is older and much stronger than<br />
you are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level<br />
with himself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.&#8221;<br />
Neptune was very angry and said, &#8220;Great heavens! strong as Jove<br />
may be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened<br />
violence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three<br />
brothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules<br />
the world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and<br />
each of us was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to<br />
me to have my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the<br />
darkness of the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds<br />
were the portion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are<br />
the common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would<br />
have me. For all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and<br />
be contented without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were<br />
nobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,<br />
who must perforce obey him.<br />
Iris fleet as the wind then answered, &#8220;Am I really, Neptune, to take<br />
this daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider<br />
your answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that<br />
the Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.&#8221;<br />
Neptune answered, &#8220;Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in<br />
season. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.<br />
Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke<br />
so angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire with<br />
himself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure;<br />
furthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to the<br />
desire of myself, Minerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King<br />
Vulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have<br />
the great triumph of sacking it, let him understand that he will incur<br />
our implacable resentment.&#8221;<br />
Neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely<br />
did the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, &#8220;Go, dear<br />
Phoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has<br />
now gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure.<br />
Had he not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have<br />
come to hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that<br />
he should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should<br />
have had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,<br />
and shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;<br />
take, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and<br />
rouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back<br />
to their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think<br />
it well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their<br />
troubles.&#8221;<br />
Apollo obeyed his father&#8217;s saying, and left the crests of Ida,<br />
flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He<br />
found Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he<br />
had just come to himself again. He knew those who were about him,<br />
and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when the<br />
will of aegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him<br />
and said, &#8220;Hector, son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you<br />
here away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?&#8221;<br />
Hector in a weak voice answered, &#8220;And which, kind sir, of the gods<br />
are you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on<br />
the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of<br />
the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that<br />
this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house of<br />
Hades.&#8221;<br />
Then King Apollo said to him, &#8220;Take heart; the son of Saturn has<br />
sent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even<br />
me, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian<br />
hitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore,<br />
order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great<br />
multitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them,<br />
and will turn the Achaeans in flight.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his<br />
people. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops<br />
gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his<br />
bath in the river- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his<br />
shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to<br />
the pastures where the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he<br />
heard what the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as<br />
fast as his limbs could take him. As country peasants set their hounds<br />
on to a homed stag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock or<br />
thicket, and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom<br />
their shouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in no<br />
further humour for the chase- even so the Achaeans were still charging<br />
on in a body, using their swords and spears pointed at both ends,<br />
but when they saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid,<br />
and their hearts fell down into their feet.<br />
Then spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man<br />
who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,<br />
while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He<br />
then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: &#8220;What, in<br />
heaven&#8217;s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?<br />
Every one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but<br />
it seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed<br />
many of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand<br />
of Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself so<br />
masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us all<br />
do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back<br />
upon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower of<br />
the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the<br />
point of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he<br />
will then think better of it before he tries to charge into the<br />
press of the Danaans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who<br />
were about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of<br />
Teucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men<br />
about them and sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, but<br />
the main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.<br />
The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on<br />
at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud<br />
about his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its<br />
shaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike<br />
terror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the<br />
Trojans.<br />
The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of<br />
battle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the<br />
bowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the<br />
bodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway,<br />
before they could taste of man&#8217;s fair flesh and glut themselves with<br />
blood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without<br />
shaking it, the weapons on either side took effect and the people<br />
fell, but when he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and<br />
raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they<br />
forgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the<br />
dead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the<br />
herdsman is not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for<br />
Apollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the<br />
Trojans.<br />
The fight then became more scattered and they killed one another<br />
where they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one,<br />
leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of<br />
Menestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son<br />
to Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from<br />
his own country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman of his<br />
stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus had become a<br />
leader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos.<br />
Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius, in the front of the<br />
battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind<br />
in the lower part of the shoulder, as he was flying among the<br />
foremost, and the point of the spear went clean through him.<br />
While they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the<br />
Achaeans were flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and<br />
were forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to the<br />
Trojans, &#8220;Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any<br />
man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I will<br />
have him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues<br />
of fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses&#8217; shoulders and<br />
called to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with<br />
a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with<br />
his own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of<br />
the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as<br />
broad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The<br />
Trojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with his<br />
redoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans<br />
as easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house of<br />
sand and then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you,<br />
O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with<br />
panic and confusion.<br />
Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to<br />
one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to<br />
heaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up<br />
his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently<br />
than any of them. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if ever any one in<br />
wheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer<br />
and prayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your<br />
head to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans<br />
to triumph thus over the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
All counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the<br />
aged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung<br />
themselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking<br />
over the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a gale-<br />
for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great- even so<br />
did the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout, and drive their<br />
chariots onwards. The two sides fought with their double-pointed<br />
spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from their chariots,<br />
and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the long<br />
pikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight,<br />
jointed and shod with bronze.<br />
Now Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting<br />
about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,<br />
remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him<br />
with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease his<br />
pain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in<br />
the wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he<br />
cried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands.<br />
&#8220;Eurypylus,&#8221; said he in his dismay, &#8220;I know you want me badly, but I<br />
cannot stay with you any longer, for there is hard fighting going<br />
on; a servant shall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to<br />
Achilles, and induce him to fight if I can; who knows but with<br />
heaven&#8217;s help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the<br />
advice of a friend.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and<br />
resisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in<br />
number, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could<br />
the Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the<br />
tents and ships. As a carpenter&#8217;s line gives a true edge to a piece of<br />
ship&#8217;s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has<br />
instructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the issue of<br />
the fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and<br />
some round another.<br />
Hector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the<br />
same ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yet<br />
could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.<br />
Then Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear as<br />
he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground<br />
and the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen<br />
in front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,<br />
&#8220;Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,<br />
but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his<br />
armour now that he has fallen.&#8221;<br />
He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit<br />
Lycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living<br />
with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans.<br />
Hector&#8217;s spear struck him on the head below the ear, and he fell<br />
headlong from the ship&#8217;s prow on to the ground with no life left in<br />
him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his brother, &#8220;Teucer, my good<br />
fellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to<br />
live with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as much as our own<br />
parents. Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at<br />
once and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you.&#8221;<br />
Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in<br />
his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hit<br />
Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of<br />
Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his<br />
horses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,<br />
doing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come<br />
upon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert<br />
it, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his<br />
chariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King<br />
Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to the<br />
horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and<br />
ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then<br />
went back and took his place in the front ranks.<br />
Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been<br />
no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then<br />
and there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes<br />
on Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his<br />
bowstring for him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim;<br />
on this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands.<br />
Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother, &#8220;Alas, see how heaven<br />
thwarts us in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the<br />
bow from my hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that it<br />
might serve me for many an arrow.&#8221;<br />
Ajax son of Telamon answered, &#8220;My good fellow, let your bow and your<br />
arrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the<br />
Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both<br />
fight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be<br />
successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find<br />
it a hard matter to take the ships.&#8221;<br />
Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield<br />
four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set<br />
his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded<br />
menacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and<br />
forthwith he was by the side of Ajax.<br />
When Hector saw that Teucer&#8217;s bow was of no more use to him, he<br />
shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, &#8220;Trojans, Lycians, and<br />
Dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your<br />
mettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their<br />
chieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when<br />
Jove is helping people and means to help them still further, or<br />
again when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for them; he<br />
is now on our side, and is going against the Argives. Therefore<br />
swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck by spear or<br />
sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour who dies<br />
fighting for his country; and he will leave his wife and children safe<br />
behind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only the<br />
Achaeans can be driven back to their own land, they and their ships.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the<br />
other side exhorted his comrades saying, &#8220;Shame on you Argives, we are<br />
now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the<br />
enemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you<br />
will be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his<br />
whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they<br />
are not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight them<br />
with might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once<br />
for all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships by<br />
worse men than ourselves.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then<br />
killed Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax<br />
killed Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas<br />
killed Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of<br />
the proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but<br />
Polydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not<br />
suffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the spear hit<br />
Croesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the<br />
ground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At that moment the<br />
valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus was son of<br />
Laomedon and for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed in all<br />
the ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus&#8217;<br />
shield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his<br />
good corslet made with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus had<br />
brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his host, King<br />
Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It now<br />
served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmost<br />
crest of Dolops&#8217;s bronze helmet with his spear and tore away its plume<br />
of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it<br />
tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and<br />
confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the<br />
side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,<br />
from behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his<br />
chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to<br />
strip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for<br />
help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,<br />
who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the<br />
war broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to<br />
Ilius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam<br />
who treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and<br />
said, &#8220;Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the<br />
death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to<br />
take Dolops&#8217;s armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives<br />
from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either<br />
we kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.&#8221;<br />
He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.<br />
Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. &#8220;My<br />
friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in<br />
battle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect each<br />
other&#8217;s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who do<br />
not, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the<br />
Trojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with a<br />
wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the<br />
loud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. &#8220;Antilochus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are<br />
young and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more<br />
valiant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and<br />
kill him.&#8221;<br />
He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once<br />
darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking<br />
carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart<br />
did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus<br />
the proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming<br />
forward, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily<br />
to the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn<br />
which a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and<br />
killed it. Even so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring<br />
upon you to strip you of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and<br />
came running up to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus,<br />
brave soldier though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like<br />
some savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it<br />
has killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body<br />
of men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor<br />
fly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air<br />
showered their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his<br />
flight till he had reached his comrades.<br />
The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the<br />
ships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on<br />
to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives<br />
and defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving<br />
glory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the<br />
ships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had<br />
made him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare<br />
of a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the<br />
Trojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory to<br />
the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, who<br />
was cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that of<br />
Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest<br />
upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under<br />
his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by<br />
reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with<br />
him, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory<br />
and glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas<br />
Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of<br />
the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranks<br />
of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest<br />
armour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for they<br />
stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from the<br />
grey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that<br />
thunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire from<br />
every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,<br />
breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar<br />
against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and<br />
they are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were the<br />
hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion<br />
attacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the<br />
low-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his<br />
wit&#8217;s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the van<br />
and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into the<br />
thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble for<br />
fear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and<br />
father Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he<br />
was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King<br />
Eurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than<br />
the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior,<br />
and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it<br />
was who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was turning back<br />
he stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached his feet,<br />
and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against this and<br />
fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did<br />
so. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear into<br />
his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These, for all<br />
their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves terribly<br />
afraid of Hector.<br />
They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had<br />
been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came<br />
pouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of<br />
ships, but they made a stand by their tents without being broken up<br />
and scattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting<br />
incessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to<br />
the Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and<br />
beseeching him to stand firm.<br />
&#8220;Be men, my friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and respect one another&#8217;s good<br />
opinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your<br />
property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their<br />
behalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and<br />
not to turn in flight.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted<br />
the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon<br />
them, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was<br />
raging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the<br />
rear who were taking no part in the battle, and those who were<br />
fighting by the ships.<br />
Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but<br />
strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve<br />
cubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of<br />
horsemanship couples four horses together and comes tearing full speed<br />
along the public way from the country into some large town- many<br />
both men and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time<br />
changing his horse, springing from one to another without ever missing<br />
his feet while the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax go<br />
striding from one ship&#8217;s deck to another, and his voice went up into<br />
the heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and<br />
exhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither did Hector<br />
remain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle<br />
swoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it<br />
may be, or cranes, or long-necked swans- even so did Hector make<br />
straight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove<br />
with his mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to<br />
follow him.<br />
And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would<br />
have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely<br />
did they fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans<br />
did not believe they should escape destruction but thought<br />
themselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat<br />
high with the hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean<br />
heroes to the sword.<br />
Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of<br />
the good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him<br />
back to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close<br />
hand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight<br />
at a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at<br />
one another in close combat with their mighty swords and spears<br />
pointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen battle-axes and<br />
with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with<br />
iron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red<br />
with blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose his<br />
hold but held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans,<br />
&#8220;Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a single<br />
voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all the<br />
rest; this day we shall take the ships which came hither against<br />
heaven&#8217;s will, and which have caused us such infinite suffering<br />
through the cowardice of our councillors, who when I would have done<br />
battle at the ships held me back and forbade the host to follow me; if<br />
Jove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands me<br />
and cheers me on.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the<br />
Achaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by<br />
the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed.<br />
Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to<br />
the seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out,<br />
and with his spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the<br />
ships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and<br />
exhorting the Danaans. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Danaan heroes,<br />
servants of Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and with<br />
main. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us<br />
more surely than the one we have? There is no strong city within<br />
reach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the scales in our<br />
favour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind<br />
us, and far from our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is in<br />
the might of our hands and in hard fighting.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when<br />
any Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector&#8217;s bidding, he<br />
would be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long<br />
spear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the<br />
ships.</p>
