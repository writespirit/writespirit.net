				<p>BOOK XXI </p>
<p>NOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,<br />
begotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one<br />
half he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that<br />
the Achaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day<br />
with Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Juno<br />
sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other half<br />
were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into it<br />
with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,<br />
as they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling<br />
eddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-<br />
the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they<br />
huddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus<br />
filled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in<br />
confusion before Achilles.<br />
Forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it<br />
against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,<br />
armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the<br />
Trojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the<br />
sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly<br />
scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some<br />
fair haven- for he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did the<br />
Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and when<br />
Achilles&#8217; arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youths<br />
alive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of<br />
Menoetius. He drew them out like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind<br />
them with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over to his<br />
men to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river,<br />
thirsting for still further blood.<br />
There he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was<br />
escaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner<br />
when he was in his father&#8217;s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as<br />
he was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker<br />
sides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,<br />
and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him.<br />
But a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum,<br />
and sent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his<br />
father&#8217;s house. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends<br />
after he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again<br />
delivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the<br />
house of Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles<br />
caught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he<br />
any spear, for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank,<br />
and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that<br />
his strength was now failing him.<br />
Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise, &#8220;What marvel do I see<br />
here? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over into<br />
Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from<br />
the world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison<br />
him, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let<br />
him taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth<br />
who can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or<br />
whether thence too he will return.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and<br />
trying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.<br />
Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon<br />
ran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed<br />
over his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for<br />
blood. With one hand he caught Achilles&#8217; knees as he besought him, and<br />
with the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then<br />
he said, &#8220;Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your<br />
suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the day<br />
when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold away<br />
to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the<br />
price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain my<br />
freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after much<br />
suffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.<br />
Surely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you a<br />
second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,<br />
daughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae<br />
and holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his<br />
daughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,<br />
both of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus as<br />
he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall<br />
me, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered<br />
me over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,<br />
spare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your<br />
brave and noble comrade.&#8221;<br />
With such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles;<br />
but Achilles answered him sternly. &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said he, &#8220;talk not to me<br />
of ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans<br />
quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive;<br />
but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my<br />
hands before the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare<br />
hardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall<br />
die. Why should you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a<br />
better man than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly?<br />
I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but<br />
the hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day<br />
will come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one<br />
shall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an<br />
arrow sped from his bow.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and Lycaon&#8217;s heart sank within him. He loosed his<br />
hold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles<br />
drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he<br />
plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he<br />
lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him<br />
till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and<br />
flung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the<br />
while, and saying, &#8220;Lie there among the fishes, who will lick the<br />
blood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you<br />
on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear you<br />
into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the<br />
fat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters- so<br />
perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you in<br />
flight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its broad<br />
silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you<br />
offered him and all the horses that you flung living into his<br />
waters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not a<br />
man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the<br />
havoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I<br />
held aloof from battle.&#8221;<br />
So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and<br />
pondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and<br />
save the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear<br />
in hand, sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was<br />
son to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of<br />
Acessamenus; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out<br />
of the water to face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus<br />
filled him with courage, being angry for the death of the youths<br />
whom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were<br />
close up with one another Achilles was first to speak. &#8220;Who and whence<br />
are you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose<br />
son stands up against me.&#8221; And the son of Pelegon answered, &#8220;Great son<br />
of Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land<br />
of far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days<br />
that I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axius<br />
that is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior<br />
Pelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.<br />
Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands<br />
alike; with the one spear he struck Achilles&#8217; shield, but did not<br />
pierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;<br />
with the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm<br />
drawing dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed<br />
itself in the ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles,<br />
fain to kill him, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit<br />
him and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the spear half its<br />
length into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and<br />
sprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw<br />
Achilles&#8217; spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug at<br />
it, trying with all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had to<br />
leave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and break it, but<br />
ere he could do so Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him.<br />
He struck him in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels came<br />
gushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over<br />
him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles set his foot on his chest and<br />
spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, &#8220;Lie there-<br />
begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to strive with<br />
the offspring of Saturn&#8217;s son. You declare yourself sprung from the<br />
blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father<br />
is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was<br />
the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any river that<br />
flows into the sea, so are his children stronger than those of any<br />
river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can be<br />
of any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son of<br />
Saturn, with whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty<br />
stream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all<br />
springs and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of<br />
great Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven.&#8221;<br />
With this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that<br />
he had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand,<br />
with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy<br />
nibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he<br />
went in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of<br />
the river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands of<br />
the son of Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus,<br />
Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain<br />
yet others, had not the river in anger taken human form, and spoken to<br />
him from out the deep waters saying, &#8220;Achilles, if you excel all in<br />
strength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you<br />
to protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you<br />
to destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,<br />
and do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with<br />
corpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself into<br />
the sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly<br />
slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble<br />
me no further.&#8221;<br />
Achilles answered, &#8220;So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I<br />
will never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent<br />
them up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I<br />
may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the<br />
gods. But the river said to Apollo, &#8220;Surely, son of Jove, lord of<br />
the silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged<br />
you straitly that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them,<br />
till twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth.&#8221;<br />
Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the<br />
river raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream<br />
into a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain<br />
and left within his waters. These he cast out on to the land,<br />
bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding<br />
them in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered<br />
about Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he<br />
could not keep his feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it<br />
came up by the roots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream<br />
with its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles<br />
struggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for<br />
he was afraid.<br />
But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him<br />
with a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans<br />
from destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear&#8217;s throw from<br />
him; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest<br />
and fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the<br />
armour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the<br />
river with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would water<br />
his garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and<br />
all his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the<br />
channels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with the<br />
water as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow-<br />
even so did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a<br />
fleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would<br />
strive to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in<br />
heaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come<br />
beating down upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on<br />
and on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it<br />
flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.<br />
Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, &#8220;Father<br />
Jove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save<br />
me from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I<br />
blame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my<br />
dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to<br />
fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would<br />
that Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; then<br />
should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems<br />
that I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as<br />
though I were some swineherd&#8217;s boy, who gets carried down a torrent<br />
while trying to cross it during a storm.&#8221;<br />
As soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him in<br />
the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.<br />
Neptune spoke first. &#8220;Son of Peleus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;be not so exceeding<br />
fearful; we are two gods, come with Jove&#8217;s sanction to assist you,<br />
I, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he<br />
will abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,<br />
if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting<br />
till you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius- as<br />
many of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships,<br />
for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.&#8221;<br />
When they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but<br />
Achilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the<br />
gods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of<br />
waters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was<br />
rifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the<br />
stream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him,<br />
for Minerva had endowed him with great strength. Nevertheless<br />
Scamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious<br />
with the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest and<br />
cried aloud to Simois saying, &#8220;Dear brother, let the two of us unite<br />
to save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and<br />
the Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; fill<br />
your streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents to<br />
a fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones come<br />
thundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creature<br />
who is now lording it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve him<br />
longer, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, which<br />
forsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over<br />
with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round him,<br />
so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for the<br />
silt in which I shall have hidden him, and when they celebrate his<br />
funeral they need build no barrow.&#8221;<br />
On this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,<br />
seething as it was with foam and blood and the bo&amp;ies of the dead. The<br />
dark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed<br />
the son of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept<br />
away in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to<br />
Vulcan her son. &#8220;Crook-foot,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;my child, be up and doing,<br />
for I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at<br />
once, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the<br />
white south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear<br />
the flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume<br />
them, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and<br />
wrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by<br />
fair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then<br />
you may stay your flames.&#8221;<br />
On this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the<br />
plain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose<br />
bodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain<br />
was dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an<br />
orchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and<br />
the heart of the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried and<br />
the dead bodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to<br />
the river. He burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus<br />
also, with the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the<br />
banks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about<br />
everywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the<br />
flames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was<br />
scalded, so that he spoke saying, &#8220;Vulcan, there is no god can hold<br />
his own against you. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames<br />
in this way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the<br />
Trojans out of city immediately. What have I to do with quarrelling<br />
and helping people?&#8221;<br />
He was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a<br />
cauldron upon &#8216;a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of<br />
some fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the<br />
dry faggots blaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of<br />
Xanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow<br />
no longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts<br />
of fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and<br />
besought her saying, &#8220;Juno, why should your son vex my stream with<br />
such especial fury? I am not so much to blame as all the others are<br />
who have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so<br />
desire it, and let son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never again<br />
will I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even when<br />
all Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.&#8221;<br />
As soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, &#8220;Son<br />
Vulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence<br />
against a god for the sake of mortals.&#8221;<br />
When she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river<br />
went back once more into his own fair bed.<br />
Xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno<br />
stayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke<br />
out among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell<br />
on one another with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious<br />
firmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was<br />
sitting on Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to<br />
blows among themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars<br />
piercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at<br />
once upon Minerva and reviled her. &#8220;Why, vixen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;have you<br />
again set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your<br />
heart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound<br />
me, and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt<br />
of my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so<br />
terrible that not even can Jove&#8217;s lightning pierce it. Here did<br />
murderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and with<br />
her strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- great<br />
and rugged and black- which men of old had set for the boundary of a<br />
field. With this she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down.<br />
Nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in<br />
the dust, while his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva<br />
laughed and vaunted over him saying, &#8220;Idiot, have you not learned<br />
how far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourself<br />
against me? Thus do your mother&#8217;s curses now roost upon you, for she<br />
is angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted the<br />
Achaeans and are helping the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
She then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove&#8217;s<br />
daughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the<br />
time, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to<br />
himself again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, &#8220;Look,<br />
daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again<br />
taking Mars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at<br />
once.&#8221;<br />
Thus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at<br />
her, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell<br />
fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full<br />
length. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, &#8220;May all who help the<br />
Trojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart<br />
as Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had<br />
this been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the<br />
strong city of Ilius.&#8221;<br />
Juno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo<br />
saying, &#8220;Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm&#8217;s length? it is<br />
not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be<br />
disgraceful to us if we return to Jove&#8217;s bronze-floored mansion on<br />
Olympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you are<br />
the younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am<br />
older and have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and<br />
forget how we two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius<br />
when we came from Jove&#8217;s house and worked for Laomedon a whole year at<br />
a stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the<br />
wall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be<br />
impregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of<br />
many valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round the<br />
time of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us<br />
off with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and<br />
sell us over into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut<br />
off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious about<br />
the payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all<br />
this, you are now showing favour to his people, and will not join us<br />
in compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and<br />
children.&#8221;<br />
And King Apollo answered, &#8220;Lord of the earthquake, you would have no<br />
respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable<br />
mortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the<br />
field, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this<br />
fighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.&#8221;<br />
He turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the<br />
brother of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana,<br />
patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, &#8220;So you<br />
would fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap<br />
vaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again<br />
hear you bragging in my father&#8217;s house, as you have often done in<br />
the presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fight<br />
with Neptune.&#8221;<br />
Apollo made her no answer, but Jove&#8217;s august queen was angry and<br />
upbraided her bitterly. &#8220;Bold vixen,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;how dare you cross<br />
me thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own<br />
against me. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill<br />
them whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wild<br />
beasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight those who are<br />
stronger than you are. If you would try war, do so, and find out by<br />
pitting yourself against me, how far stronger I am than you are.&#8221;<br />
She caught both Diana&#8217;s wrists with her left hand as she spoke,<br />
and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as<br />
she beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed<br />
under her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she<br />
fled weeping from under Juno&#8217;s hand as a dove that flies before a<br />
falcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune<br />
to escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and<br />
arrows behind her.<br />
Then the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, &#8220;Leto, I<br />
shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove&#8217;s<br />
wives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you<br />
worsted me in fair fight.&#8221;<br />
Leto then gathered up Diana&#8217;s bow and arrows that had fallen about<br />
amid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste<br />
after her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove&#8217;s bronze-floored<br />
mansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the<br />
knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all<br />
about her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing<br />
pleasantly the while began to question her saying, &#8220;Which of the<br />
heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruel<br />
manner, as though you had been misconducting yourself in the face of<br />
everybody?&#8221; and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, &#8220;It<br />
was your wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is always<br />
her doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the<br />
strong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not<br />
hold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there, before<br />
its hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back,<br />
some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats<br />
beside Jove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on<br />
dealing out death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the<br />
smoke from some burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the<br />
gods has kindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not<br />
a few- even so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.<br />
Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on<br />
huge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there<br />
was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and<br />
with many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave<br />
warders of the gate. &#8220;Keep the gates,&#8221; said he, &#8220;wide open till the<br />
people come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is<br />
driving them in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. As<br />
soon as our people are inside and in safety, close the strong gates<br />
for I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding inside along<br />
with the others.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and<br />
when these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans.<br />
Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect<br />
them. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and<br />
grimy with dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his<br />
spear furiously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was<br />
thirsting after glory.<br />
Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if<br />
Apollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. He<br />
put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,<br />
leaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When<br />
Agenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with<br />
care. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he to himself in his dismay, &#8220;if I fly before<br />
mighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout,<br />
he will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would<br />
it be were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then fly<br />
from the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs<br />
of Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could then<br />
wash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return to<br />
Ilius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he would<br />
see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would<br />
speed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against<br />
him, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and<br />
meet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be<br />
pierced by pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men<br />
say that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son of<br />
Saturn vouchsafes him.&#8221;<br />
So saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now<br />
fain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert<br />
to attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the<br />
baying of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and<br />
wound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has<br />
pierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her<br />
grip or been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son of<br />
Antenor refuse to fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim<br />
at him with his spear, holding his round shield before him and<br />
crying with a loud voice. &#8220;Of a truth,&#8221; said he, &#8220;noble Achilles,<br />
you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.<br />
Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is many<br />
a brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear<br />
parents with our wives and children, to defend Ilius. Here<br />
therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.<br />
As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the<br />
spear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly<br />
wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him<br />
whom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed<br />
it. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not<br />
vouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a<br />
thick mist, sending him out of the battle unmolested Then he<br />
craftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he<br />
put on the semblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran<br />
towards him to give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of<br />
the plain, turning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander.<br />
Apollo ran but a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making<br />
him think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.<br />
Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within<br />
the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare<br />
wait for one another outside the city walls, to learn who had<br />
escaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees<br />
could still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXII</p>
<p>THUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat<br />
from off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the<br />
goodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon<br />
their shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector<br />
stay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus<br />
Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, &#8220;Why, son of Peleus, do you,<br />
who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet<br />
found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not<br />
harass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within<br />
their walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you<br />
cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.&#8221;<br />
Achilles was greatly angered and said, &#8220;You have baulked me,<br />
Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from<br />
the wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got<br />
within Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the<br />
Trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I<br />
would indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.&#8221;<br />
On this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the<br />
winning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is<br />
flying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of<br />
Achilles bear him onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he<br />
scoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion&#8217;s<br />
Hound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly<br />
than those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them all<br />
though he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and<br />
fever in his train- even so did Achilles&#8217; armour gleam on his breast<br />
as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his head with his<br />
hands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,<br />
imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, for<br />
his heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached<br />
out his arms towards him and bade him for pity&#8217;s sake come within<br />
the walls. &#8220;Hector,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;my son, stay not to face this man<br />
alone and unsupported, or you will meet death at the hands of the<br />
son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is;<br />
would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogs<br />
and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and a<br />
load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son<br />
has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away in<br />
the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from<br />
among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and<br />
Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be<br />
still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with<br />
gold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed<br />
his daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house<br />
of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit<br />
the grief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish<br />
at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be<br />
the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose<br />
your own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have<br />
pity also on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him- on me,<br />
whom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the<br />
threshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters<br />
haled away as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children<br />
dashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons&#8217; wives dragged<br />
away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will<br />
tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life<br />
out of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed<br />
at my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and<br />
then lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the<br />
sword in battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly;<br />
let what will be seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man<br />
is slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs<br />
should defile his grey hair and beard and all that men hide for<br />
shame.&#8221;<br />
The old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the<br />
heart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared<br />
her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. &#8220;Hector,&#8221;<br />
she cried, weeping bitterly the while, &#8220;Hector, my son, spurn not this<br />
breast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort<br />
from my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall<br />
to protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the<br />
wretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever<br />
weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs<br />
will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved<br />
not the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge<br />
Achilles as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the<br />
mountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of<br />
man- he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes<br />
writhing round his den- even so Hector leaned his shield against a<br />
tower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.<br />
&#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, &#8220;if I go<br />
within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon<br />
me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city<br />
on that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would<br />
not listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now<br />
that my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and<br />
Trojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, &#8216;Hector has<br />
ruined us by his self-confidence.&#8217; Surely it would be better for me to<br />
return after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die<br />
gloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down my<br />
shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up<br />
to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was<br />
the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus<br />
brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans<br />
divide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?<br />
I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a<br />
solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two<br />
shares all that is within the city- but why argue with myself in<br />
this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he<br />
would kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,<br />
when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from some<br />
rock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another.<br />
Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe<br />
victory.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were<br />
Mars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he<br />
brandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed<br />
around him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell<br />
upon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he<br />
was but fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted<br />
after him at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all<br />
birds, swoops down upon some cowering dove- the dove flies before<br />
him but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after,<br />
resolved to have her- even so did Achilles make straight for Hector<br />
with all his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as<br />
his limbs could take him.<br />
On they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the<br />
wall, past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild<br />
fig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river<br />
Scamander. One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it<br />
as smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as<br />
cold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by<br />
the springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the<br />
time of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair<br />
daughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these did<br />
they fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good<br />
was the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after,<br />
and swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for<br />
sacrifice or bullock&#8217;s hide, as it might be for a common foot-race,<br />
but they ran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed<br />
round the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize-<br />
a tripod or woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did<br />
these two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. All<br />
the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to<br />
speak.<br />
&#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being<br />
pursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for<br />
Hector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my<br />
honour, at one while on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the<br />
citadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him<br />
round the city of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and<br />
decide whether we shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though<br />
he be, before Achilles, son of Peleus.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva said, &#8220;Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of<br />
cloud and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom<br />
has long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we<br />
others shall not be of a mind with you.&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not<br />
speak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without<br />
let or hindrance as you are minded.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she<br />
darted from the topmost summits of Olympus.<br />
Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a<br />
fawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and<br />
hunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by<br />
crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and<br />
follow her up until he gets her- even so there was no escape for<br />
Hector from the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get<br />
near the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people might<br />
help him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles would gain<br />
on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself always<br />
on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon<br />
another whom he is pursuing- the one cannot escape nor the other<br />
overtake- even so neither could Achilles come up with Hector, nor<br />
Hector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have<br />
escaped death had not the time come when Apollo, who thus far had<br />
sustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer to<br />
stay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook his<br />
head to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hector, lest another<br />
might win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in<br />
second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for the<br />
fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a<br />
doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As he<br />
held the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deep<br />
into the house of Hades- and then Phoebus Apollo left him. Thereon<br />
Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said, &#8220;Noble<br />
Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the<br />
ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust<br />
of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father,<br />
aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and take<br />
breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand and<br />
fight you.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,<br />
leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him<br />
and went after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She<br />
came close up to him and said, &#8220;Dear brother, I see you are hard<br />
pressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of<br />
Priam, let us await his onset and stand on our defence.&#8221;<br />
And Hector answered, &#8220;Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to<br />
me of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth<br />
I shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured<br />
outside the wall for my sake when all the others remain inside.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva said, &#8220;Dear brother, my father and mother went down<br />
on their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain<br />
inside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an<br />
agony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a<br />
stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve,<br />
that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our<br />
spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you.&#8221;<br />
Thus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two<br />
were now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. &#8220;I<br />
will-no longer fly you, son of Peleus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;as I have been doing<br />
hitherto. Three times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam,<br />
without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be<br />
slain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to<br />
one another by our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians<br />
of all covenants; let it be agreed between us that if Jove<br />
vouchsafes me the longer stay and I take your life, I am not to<br />
treat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, but when I have stripped<br />
you of your armour, I am to give up your body to the Achaeans. And<br />
do you likewise.&#8221;<br />
Achilles glared at him and answered, &#8220;Fool, prate not to me about<br />
covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and<br />
lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out an<br />
through. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,<br />
nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall<br />
fall and glut grim Mars with his life&#8217;s blood. Put forth all your<br />
strength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier<br />
and man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will<br />
forthwith vanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for<br />
the grief you have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have<br />
killed in battle.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it<br />
coming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew<br />
over his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it<br />
up and gave it back to Achilles without Hector&#8217;s seeing her; Hector<br />
thereon said to the son of Peleus, &#8220;You have missed your aim,<br />
Achilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the<br />
hour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were<br />
a false-tongued liar when you deemed that I should forget my valour<br />
and quail before you. You shall not drive spear into the back of a<br />
runaway- drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it into<br />
me as I make straight towards you; and now for your own part avoid<br />
my spear if you can- would that you might receive the whole of it into<br />
your body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the war an<br />
easier matter, for it is you who have harmed them most.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true<br />
for he hit the middle of Achilles&#8217; shield, but the spear rebounded<br />
from it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that<br />
the weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay<br />
for he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and<br />
asked him for one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and<br />
said to himself, &#8220;Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I<br />
deemed that the hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the<br />
wall, and Minerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly<br />
near at hand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his son<br />
Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been<br />
ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then<br />
die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some<br />
great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong<br />
by his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like<br />
a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or<br />
timid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon<br />
Achilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous<br />
shield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four<br />
layers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold<br />
wi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the<br />
evening star that shines brighter than all others through the<br />
stillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear which<br />
Achilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of noble<br />
Hector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he could<br />
best wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of which<br />
Hector had spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only the<br />
throat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders,<br />
and this is a most deadly place: here then did Achilles strike him<br />
as he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went right<br />
through the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe<br />
so that he could still speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles<br />
vaunted over him saying, &#8220;Hector, you deemed that you should come<br />
off scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of<br />
myself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade,<br />
mightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, and<br />
now I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him all due funeral<br />
rites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon yourself.&#8221;<br />
Then Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, &#8220;I pray you by<br />
your life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at<br />
the ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and<br />
bronze which my father and mother will offer you, and send my body<br />
home, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire<br />
when I am dead.&#8221;<br />
Achilles glared at him and answered, &#8220;Dog, talk not to me neither of<br />
knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to<br />
cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me,<br />
as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not be,<br />
though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on<br />
the spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of<br />
Dardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your<br />
mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she<br />
bore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up.&#8221;<br />
Hector with his dying breath then said, &#8220;I know you what you are,<br />
and was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as<br />
iron; look to it that I bring not heaven&#8217;s anger upon you on the day<br />
when Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you<br />
at the Scaean gates.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his<br />
soul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting<br />
its sad fate that it should en&#8217; youth and strength no longer. But<br />
Achilles said, speaking to the dead body, &#8220;Die; for my part I will<br />
accept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one<br />
side; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector&#8217;s<br />
shoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view his<br />
wondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him without<br />
giving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour and<br />
say, &#8220;It is easier to handle Hector now than when he was flinging fire<br />
on to our ships&#8221; and as he spoke he would thrust his spear into him<br />
anew.<br />
When Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among<br />
the Argives and said, &#8220;My friends, princes and counsellors of the<br />
Argives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who<br />
has done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether<br />
we should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind<br />
the Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert<br />
their city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even<br />
though he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this<br />
way, while Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and<br />
unmourned- he Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my<br />
strength fails not? Though men forget their dead when once they are<br />
within the house of Hades, yet not even there will I forget the<br />
comrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise<br />
the song of victory and go back to the ships taking this man along<br />
with us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble<br />
Hector to whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he<br />
were a god.&#8221;<br />
On this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the<br />
sinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed<br />
thongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body<br />
fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when<br />
he had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted,<br />
he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust<br />
rose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all<br />
abroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove<br />
had now delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage<br />
in his own land.<br />
Thus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His<br />
mother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as<br />
she looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and<br />
throughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was<br />
as though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire.<br />
Hardly could the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush<br />
without the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and besought<br />
them, calling each one of them by his name. &#8220;Let be, my friends,&#8221; he<br />
cried, &#8220;and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to<br />
the ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man,<br />
if maybe he will respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have<br />
compassion on my old age. His own father is even such another as<br />
myself- Peleus, who bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us<br />
Trojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has<br />
he slain in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I<br />
may, I do so for one- Hector- more than for them all, and the<br />
bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades.<br />
Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred<br />
mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort of<br />
weeping and mourning over him.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city<br />
joined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among<br />
the Trojans. &#8220;Alas, my son,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what have I left to live<br />
for now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you<br />
throughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all in<br />
Troy, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you<br />
lived you were their pride, but now death and destruction have<br />
fallen upon you.&#8221;<br />
Hector&#8217;s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to<br />
tell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at<br />
her loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web,<br />
and embroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a<br />
large tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector<br />
when he came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now<br />
beyond the reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the<br />
hands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and<br />
trembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she<br />
spoke to her waiting-women. &#8220;Two of you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;come with me that<br />
I may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my<br />
husband&#8217;s honoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would<br />
come into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great<br />
misfortune for Priam&#8217;s children must be at hand. May I never live to<br />
hear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of<br />
brave Hector and has chased him on to the plain where he was<br />
singlehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless daring<br />
which possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body of<br />
his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in<br />
valour.&#8221;<br />
Her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a<br />
maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the<br />
battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the<br />
wall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the horses<br />
dragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of<br />
the Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of<br />
night and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from her<br />
head and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited<br />
band, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when<br />
Hector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after having<br />
given countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband&#8217;s sisters<br />
and the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for<br />
she was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently<br />
breathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the<br />
Trojans saying, &#8216;Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a<br />
common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at<br />
Thebes under the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion<br />
who brought me up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of an<br />
ill-starred daughter- would that he had never begotten me. You are now<br />
going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth,<br />
and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom<br />
you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that<br />
you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.<br />
Even though he escape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans,<br />
yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for<br />
others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of his<br />
parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks<br />
are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the friends<br />
of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the shirt.<br />
Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the cup<br />
for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must not<br />
drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents<br />
are alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.<br />
&#8216;Out with you,&#8217; he will say, &#8216;you have no father here,&#8217; and the<br />
child will go crying back to his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, who<br />
erewhile would sit upon his father&#8217;s knees, and have none but the<br />
daintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played till<br />
he was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms<br />
of his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care,<br />
whereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be full of<br />
hardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hector,<br />
were the only defence of their gates and battlements. The wriggling<br />
writhing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from your parents,<br />
when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You will lie naked,<br />
although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment made by<br />
hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you, for<br />
you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown<br />
you by the Trojans both men and women.&#8221;<br />
In such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women<br />
joined in her lament.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXIII</p>
<p>THUS did they make their moan throughout the city, while the<br />
Achaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his<br />
own ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to<br />
his brave comrades saying, &#8220;Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own<br />
trusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse<br />
and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour<br />
to the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we will<br />
unyoke our horses and take supper all of us here.&#8221;<br />
On this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in<br />
their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round<br />
the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.<br />
The sands of the seashore and the men&#8217;s armour were wet with their<br />
weeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost.<br />
Chief in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his<br />
bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend. &#8220;Fare well,&#8221; he<br />
cried, &#8220;Patroclus, even in the house of Hades. I will now do all<br />
that I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs<br />
devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before<br />
your pyre to avenge you.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,<br />
laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The<br />
others then put off every man his armour, took the horses from their<br />
chariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of<br />
the fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an<br />
abundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and<br />
bleating goat did they butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar<br />
moreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in the<br />
flames of Vulcan; and rivulets of blood flowed all round the place<br />
where the body was lying.<br />
Then the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to<br />
Agamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so<br />
wroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached<br />
Agamemnon&#8217;s tent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod<br />
over the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus &#8216;to wash<br />
the clotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore<br />
it with a solemn oath, saying, &#8220;Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest<br />
of all gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I<br />
have laid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved<br />
my head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw<br />
nigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,<br />
but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and<br />
provide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of<br />
darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner,<br />
and the people shall turn again to their own labours.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste<br />
to prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so<br />
that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and<br />
drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son<br />
of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the<br />
sounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one<br />
after another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased<br />
the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing<br />
Hector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew<br />
near him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of<br />
his beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit<br />
hovered over his head and said-<br />
&#8220;You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,<br />
but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all<br />
speed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows<br />
of men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not<br />
yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander<br />
all desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your<br />
hand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,<br />
never shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore<br />
shall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the<br />
cruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around<br />
me- nay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the<br />
wall of the noble Trojans.<br />
&#8220;One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my<br />
bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we<br />
were brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought<br />
me to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed<br />
the son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel<br />
over the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated<br />
me kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie<br />
in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by<br />
your mother.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;Why, true heart, are you come hither to<br />
lay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have<br />
bidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around<br />
one another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.&#8221;<br />
He opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped<br />
him in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a<br />
vapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his<br />
feet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, &#8220;Of a truth<br />
even in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have<br />
no life in them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has<br />
hovered over head making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do<br />
for him, and looking wondrously like himself.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning<br />
about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then<br />
King Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring<br />
wood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They<br />
went out with woodmen&#8217;s axes and strong ropes in their hands, and<br />
before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by<br />
straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of<br />
many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a<br />
tall branching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They<br />
split the trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended<br />
their way as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the<br />
plain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire<br />
to Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line<br />
upon the seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty<br />
monument for Patroclus and for himself.<br />
When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole<br />
ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles<br />
ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke<br />
each man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and<br />
mounted each his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. The<br />
chariots went before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud<br />
in their tens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades<br />
bore Patroclus and covered him with the locks of their hair which they<br />
cut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head<br />
bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of<br />
Hades.<br />
When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they<br />
laid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought<br />
him of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off<br />
the yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He<br />
looked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, &#8220;Spercheius,<br />
in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to<br />
my loved native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy<br />
hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your<br />
springs, where is your grove and your altar fragrant with<br />
burnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilled<br />
his prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I give<br />
this lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and<br />
all who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun<br />
would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently<br />
said to Agamemnon, &#8220;Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people<br />
will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from<br />
mourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting<br />
their dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is<br />
wanted here, and let the other princes also stay by me.&#8221;<br />
When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their<br />
ships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a<br />
pyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all<br />
sorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep<br />
and oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and<br />
wrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed<br />
carcases all round it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars<br />
of honey and unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the<br />
pyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead hero had had<br />
house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre;<br />
he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid<br />
them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then he<br />
committed all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; he<br />
groaned aloud and callid on his dead comrade by name. &#8220;Fare well,&#8221;<br />
he cried, &#8220;Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now doing all<br />
that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the<br />
flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour<br />
the flesh of Hector son of Priam.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,<br />
for Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and<br />
anointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be<br />
torn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover<br />
sent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the<br />
whole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch<br />
his body.<br />
Now the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles<br />
therefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to<br />
the two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He<br />
made them many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them<br />
to come and help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and<br />
the dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and<br />
started off to fetch the winds. They were holding high feast in the<br />
house of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone<br />
threshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as they set eyes<br />
on her they all came towards her and each of them called her to him,<br />
but Iris would not sit down. &#8220;I cannot stay,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must go<br />
back to the streams of Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who<br />
are offering hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share;<br />
but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him,<br />
and he vows them goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon the<br />
pyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting.&#8221;<br />
With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent<br />
the air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until<br />
they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when<br />
they reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames<br />
roared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow<br />
hard and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his<br />
double cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling<br />
upon the spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground<br />
until the earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning<br />
the bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of<br />
his parents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of<br />
his comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and<br />
lamentation.<br />
At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light<br />
which saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the<br />
flames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond<br />
the Thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The<br />
son of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome<br />
with toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who<br />
were about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him<br />
with the noise and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said,<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour<br />
red wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then gather<br />
the bones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out with<br />
care; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the pyre,<br />
while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and<br />
burned at the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in<br />
two layers of fat, against the time when I shall myself go down into<br />
the house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one<br />
now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who may<br />
be left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and high.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First<br />
they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the<br />
fire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their<br />
loved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of<br />
fat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside<br />
the tent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be,<br />
made a foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the<br />
earth. When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but<br />
Achilles stayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought<br />
prizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble<br />
oxen, women with fair girdles, and swart iron.<br />
The first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman<br />
skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had<br />
ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the<br />
man who came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare,<br />
unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly<br />
cauldron that had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as<br />
when it left the maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize<br />
was two talents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet<br />
unsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argives<br />
saying-<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that<br />
lie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I<br />
should carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you<br />
know how far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal;<br />
Neptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to<br />
myself; but I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their<br />
brave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear<br />
water and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping<br />
here, with their manes trailing on the ground in the extremity of<br />
their sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in order throughout the<br />
host, whosoever has confidence in his horses and in the strength of<br />
his chariot.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred<br />
themselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of<br />
Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty<br />
Diomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken<br />
from Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,<br />
yellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet<br />
horses, Agamemnon&#8217;s mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare<br />
had been given to Agamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he<br />
might not have to follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take<br />
his ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in<br />
spacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put<br />
under the yoke.<br />
Fourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus,<br />
made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came<br />
up to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but<br />
little need. &#8220;Antilochus,&#8221; said Nestor, &#8220;you are young, but Jove and<br />
Neptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent<br />
horseman. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are<br />
skilful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the horses<br />
themselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your<br />
chances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are<br />
fleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some<br />
artifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not slip<br />
through your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by brute<br />
force; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea,<br />
and so by skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide in<br />
rounding this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing<br />
may have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he sees<br />
the doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to pull the<br />
rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will give<br />
you this certain token which cannot escape your notice. There is a<br />
stump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above the<br />
ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of<br />
the road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is a<br />
clear course all round it. It may have been a monument to some one<br />
long since dead, or it may have been used as a doubling-post in days<br />
gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark<br />
round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but<br />
as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on<br />
your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose<br />
rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of<br />
your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you<br />
will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces, which would<br />
be sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear<br />
son, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to round<br />
the post there is no chance of any one giving you the goby later,<br />
not even though you had Adrestus&#8217;s horse Arion behind you horse<br />
which is of divine race- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest<br />
in this country.&#8221;<br />
When Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in<br />
his place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then<br />
all mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the<br />
helmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next<br />
came that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of<br />
Atreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son<br />
of Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places in<br />
line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were<br />
to turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father&#8217;s<br />
follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.<br />
At the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck<br />
them with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They<br />
flew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from<br />
under them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all<br />
flying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the<br />
ground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood<br />
erect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of<br />
victory. Each kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the<br />
plain amid the clouds of dust that they raised.<br />
It was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way<br />
back towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and it<br />
was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres<br />
now took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions<br />
of Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus&#8217;s chariot, and<br />
he could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad<br />
shoulders, for their heads were close to him as they flew over the<br />
course. Diomed would have now passed him, or there would have been a<br />
dead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip.<br />
Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on<br />
faster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through his<br />
having no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo had played the<br />
son of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into his<br />
horses; moreover she went after the son of Admetus in a rage and broke<br />
his yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and the<br />
other to the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.<br />
Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,<br />
mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised<br />
above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no<br />
utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shot<br />
far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered Diomed<br />
himself with glory.<br />
Menelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called<br />
to his father&#8217;s horses. &#8220;On with you both,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and do your<br />
very utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of<br />
Tydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has covered<br />
Diomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of<br />
Atreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt<br />
you. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall<br />
surely be- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you<br />
to the sword, if we win any the worse a prize through your<br />
carelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a<br />
plan for passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not<br />
fail me.&#8221;<br />
They feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went<br />
quicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had<br />
sunk. The ground was broken, for the winter&#8217;s rain had gathered and<br />
had worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was<br />
making towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but<br />
Antilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little<br />
on one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out,<br />
&#8220;Antilochus, you are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road<br />
is too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then;<br />
if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.&#8221;<br />
But Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had<br />
not heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young<br />
man can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his<br />
strength, and then Menelaus&#8217;s mares drew behind, for he left off<br />
driving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the<br />
chariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might both<br />
come headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and<br />
said, &#8220;There is no greater trickster living than you are; go, and<br />
bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well that you have<br />
understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prize<br />
without sworn protest on my part.&#8221;<br />
Then he called on his horses and said to them, &#8220;Keep your pace,<br />
and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner<br />
than yours, for they are neither of them young.&#8221;<br />
The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so<br />
that they were soon nearly up with the others.<br />
Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses<br />
went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.<br />
Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running,<br />
for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most<br />
commanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but<br />
Idomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse<br />
quite plainly- a chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on<br />
its forehead. He stood up and said among the Argives, &#8220;My friends,<br />
princes and counsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as<br />
well as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now, and<br />
another driver; those that led off at the start must have been<br />
disabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their way<br />
round the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, I<br />
cannot find them. Perhaps the reins fell from the driver&#8217;s hand so<br />
that he lost command of his horses at the doubling-post, and could not<br />
turn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out there, and broken<br />
his chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone off<br />
wildly in a panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make out<br />
for certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler over<br />
the Argives, brave Diomed the son of Tydeus.&#8221;<br />
Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, &#8220;Idomeneus,<br />
why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the<br />
mares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the<br />
youngest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always<br />
laying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there are<br />
better men here than you are. Eumelus&#8217;s horses are in front now, as<br />
they always have been, and he is on the chariot holding the reins.&#8221;<br />
The captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, &#8220;Ajax you are an<br />
excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much<br />
else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or<br />
cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are<br />
first. You will then know to your cost.&#8221;<br />
Ajax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there<br />
would have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles<br />
risen in his place and said, &#8220;Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus;<br />
it is not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the<br />
like: sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding<br />
towards the winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both<br />
of you know whose horses are first, and whose come after.&#8221;<br />
As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his<br />
whip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they<br />
flew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,<br />
and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet<br />
horses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and<br />
the horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in<br />
the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests<br />
fell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his<br />
goodly chariot, and leaned his whip against his horses&#8217; yoke; brave<br />
Sthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave<br />
the woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.<br />
Then he unyoked the horses.<br />
Next after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had<br />
passed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but<br />
even so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the<br />
horse that draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a<br />
horse&#8217;s tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much<br />
space between wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus<br />
was no further than this behind Antilochus, though at first he had<br />
been a full disc&#8217;s throw behind him. He had soon caught him up<br />
again, for Agamemnon&#8217;s mare Aethe kept pulling stronger and<br />
stronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passed<br />
him, and there would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus&#8217;s brave<br />
squire Meriones was about a spear&#8217;s cast behind Menelaus. His horses<br />
were slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them all<br />
came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horses<br />
on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among<br />
the Argives saying, &#8220;The best man is coming in last. Let us give him a<br />
prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the first<br />
must go to the son of Tydeus.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,<br />
and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor&#8217;s son Antilochus stood<br />
up and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. &#8220;Achilles,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me<br />
of my prize, because you think Eumelus&#8217;s chariot and horses were<br />
thrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have<br />
prayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he had<br />
done so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in<br />
your tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from<br />
this store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and<br />
give him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; but<br />
I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her, let<br />
him come on.&#8221;<br />
Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,<br />
who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said-<br />
&#8220;Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will<br />
give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it<br />
which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.&#8221;<br />
He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,<br />
and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received<br />
it gladly.<br />
But Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An<br />
attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep<br />
silence: the hero then addressed them. &#8220;Antilochus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what is<br />
this from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a<br />
poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of<br />
them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O<br />
princes and counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no<br />
favour, lest one of the Achaeans say, &#8216;Menelaus has got the mare<br />
through lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior to<br />
Antilochus&#8217;s, but he has greater weight and influence.&#8217; Nay, I will<br />
determine the matter myself, and no man will blame me, for I shall<br />
do what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is,<br />
whip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on your<br />
steeds, and swear by earth-encircling Neptune that you did not<br />
purposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses.&#8221;<br />
And Antilochus answered, &#8220;Forgive me; I am much younger, King<br />
Menelaus, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the<br />
better man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into<br />
indiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have less<br />
judgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me; I will<br />
of my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claim<br />
any further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield it<br />
to you, at once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and do<br />
wrong in the sight of heaven.&#8221;<br />
The son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to<br />
Menelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a<br />
field of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the<br />
harvest- even so, O Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you.<br />
He turned to Antilochus and said, &#8220;Now, Antilochus, angry though I<br />
have been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have never<br />
been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth<br />
has got the better of your judgement; be careful how you outwit your<br />
betters in future; no one else could have brought me round so<br />
easily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have all of<br />
you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield to your<br />
entreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeed<br />
be; the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive.&#8221;<br />
With this he gave the mare over to Antilochus&#8217;s comrade Noemon,<br />
and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,<br />
carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the<br />
two-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up<br />
to him among the assembled Argives and saying, &#8220;Take this, my good old<br />
friend, as an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for<br />
you shall see him no more among the Argives. I give you this prize<br />
though you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight,<br />
and cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of<br />
age has been laid heavily upon you.&#8221;<br />
So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and<br />
answered, &#8220;My son, all that you have said is true; there is no<br />
strength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from<br />
either shoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when<br />
the Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons<br />
offered prizes in his honour. There was then none that could vie<br />
with me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the<br />
Aetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in<br />
wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against me.<br />
Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther with<br />
my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone did<br />
the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in front<br />
of me, for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at the<br />
greater part of the prizes remaining in the place in which they had<br />
been offered. They were twins, and the one kept on holding the<br />
reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such was<br />
I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I must<br />
bow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminent<br />
among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests in<br />
honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart<br />
rejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill<br />
towards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all<br />
which may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.&#8221;<br />
Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of<br />
Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and<br />
presently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He<br />
brought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the<br />
crowd- a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old- when it is<br />
hardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for the<br />
vanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among<br />
the Argives, &#8220;Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our<br />
two champion boxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these<br />
prizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom<br />
the Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with<br />
him to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double<br />
cup.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great<br />
stature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand<br />
on the mule and said, &#8220;Let the man who is to have the cup come hither,<br />
for none but myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all<br />
here present, and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should<br />
fall short of you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at<br />
everything. I tell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man<br />
will box with me I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore<br />
let his friends stay here in a body and be at hand to take him away<br />
when I have done with him.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of<br />
Mecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes<br />
after the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all<br />
the people of Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus&#8217;s second,<br />
cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he put<br />
a waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs of<br />
ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of the<br />
ring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they punish one<br />
another and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could hear the<br />
horrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore of<br />
their skin. Presently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on the<br />
jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep his legs; they<br />
gave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a<br />
fish leaps into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn with<br />
sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls<br />
back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raised<br />
him up; his comrades also came round him and led him from the ring,<br />
unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting great<br />
clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to fetch the<br />
double cup.<br />
The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest<br />
and showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of<br />
wrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting<br />
upon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve<br />
oxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of<br />
arts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the<br />
Argives, &#8220;Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.&#8221;<br />
Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty<br />
Ulysses, full of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went<br />
into the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong<br />
hands like the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof<br />
of a high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as<br />
they tugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rained<br />
from them in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and<br />
shoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory<br />
and to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;<br />
Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of<br />
watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, &#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,<br />
you shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between<br />
us.&#8221;<br />
He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not<br />
forget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee,<br />
so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with<br />
Ulysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then<br />
Ulysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground<br />
but could not lift him right off it, his knee sank under him, and<br />
the two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed with<br />
dust. They now sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet a<br />
third time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. &#8220;Put not each other<br />
further,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to such cruel suffering; the victory is with<br />
both alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the other<br />
Achaeans now compete.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their<br />
shirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.<br />
The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a<br />
mixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six<br />
measures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty;<br />
it was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought<br />
into port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present<br />
of it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in<br />
ransom of Priam&#8217;s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize<br />
in honour of his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For<br />
the second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the<br />
last there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said<br />
among the Argives, &#8220;Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.&#8221;<br />
Forthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and<br />
Nestor&#8217;s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of his<br />
time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The<br />
course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of<br />
Oileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as<br />
the shuttle is to a woman&#8217;s bosom when she throws the woof across<br />
the warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was<br />
Ulysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settle<br />
there, and Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he<br />
ran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him<br />
straining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when<br />
they were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to<br />
Minerva. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and help my feet, O goddess.&#8221; Thus<br />
did he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands<br />
and his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point of<br />
pouncing upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva&#8217;s spite slipped upon<br />
some offal that was lying there from the cattle which Achilles had<br />
slaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were<br />
all filled with cow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off the<br />
mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took<br />
the ox and stood with his hand on one of its horns, spitting the<br />
dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, &#8220;Alas, the goddess<br />
has spoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and stands by him<br />
as though she were his own mother.&#8221; Thus did he speak and they all<br />
of them laughed heartily.<br />
Antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the<br />
bystanders, &#8220;You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown<br />
their respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and<br />
as for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in<br />
spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him<br />
save only Achilles.&#8221;<br />
He said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and<br />
Achilles answered, &#8220;Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no<br />
purpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold.&#8221; He<br />
then gave the half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.<br />
Then the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that<br />
had been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He<br />
stood up and said among the Argives, &#8220;We bid two champions put on<br />
their armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in<br />
the presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the<br />
flesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him<br />
will I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I<br />
took from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,<br />
and I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.&#8221;<br />
Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty<br />
Diomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his<br />
own side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to<br />
engage, and with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled<br />
as they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with one<br />
another, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try to strike<br />
each other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed&#8217;s round shield, but<br />
did not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the shield protected<br />
him; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aiming<br />
continually at Ajax&#8217;s neck with the point of his spear, and the<br />
Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting and<br />
divide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword to<br />
the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with which<br />
to hang it.<br />
Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had<br />
erewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried<br />
it off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said<br />
among the Argives, &#8220;Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.<br />
He who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years<br />
as they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town<br />
his shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,<br />
for he will have a stock of it on his own premises.&#8221;<br />
Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax<br />
son of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other<br />
and Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set<br />
all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of<br />
Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any<br />
mark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit<br />
he hurled it as though it had been a stockman&#8217;s stick which he sends<br />
flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far did<br />
his throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared<br />
applause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set it on<br />
board his ship.<br />
Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten<br />
double-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship&#8217;s mast,<br />
some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to<br />
it by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. &#8220;Whoever,&#8221; he said,<br />
&#8220;can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with<br />
him; he who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a<br />
worse aim and shall have the single-edged axes.&#8221;<br />
Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of<br />
Idomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot<br />
of Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he<br />
did not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and<br />
missed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with<br />
which the bird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean<br />
through so that it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew<br />
up into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who<br />
had his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of<br />
his hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of<br />
firstling lambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon<br />
high up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as<br />
she was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and<br />
fixed itself in the ground at Meriones&#8217; feet, but the bird perched<br />
on the ship&#8217;s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers<br />
drooping; the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from the<br />
mast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, while<br />
Teucer bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.<br />
Then the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had<br />
never been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a<br />
pattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to<br />
wit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart<br />
squire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, &#8220;Son of Atreus, we<br />
know how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the<br />
javelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so<br />
please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I<br />
should myself wish.&#8221;<br />
King Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,<br />
and handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXIV</p>
<p>THE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his<br />
own ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought<br />
them of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for<br />
thinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow,<br />
could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he<br />
yearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all<br />
they had done together, and all they had gone through both on the<br />
field of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on<br />
these things he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his<br />
back, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one<br />
distraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn<br />
breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and<br />
bound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice<br />
did he drag it round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went<br />
back into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and<br />
with its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be<br />
disfigured, for he pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore<br />
he shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he might<br />
take no hurt while Achilles was dragging him.<br />
Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the<br />
blessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury,<br />
slayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only<br />
Juno, Neptune, and Jove&#8217;s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the<br />
hate which they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his<br />
people; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in<br />
disdaining the goddesses who came to him when he was in his<br />
sheepyards, and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to his<br />
ruin.<br />
When, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come,<br />
Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, &#8220;You gods ought to be<br />
ashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not<br />
Hector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And<br />
now dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon,<br />
with his mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would<br />
forthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral<br />
rites? So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who<br />
knows neither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in<br />
the pride of his great strength and daring springs upon men&#8217;s flocks<br />
and gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all<br />
that conscience which at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him<br />
that will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost-<br />
a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother&#8217;s womb; yet<br />
when he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it<br />
takes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has<br />
slain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his<br />
comrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so,<br />
for brave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his<br />
fury upon dead clay.&#8221;<br />
Juno spoke up in a rage. &#8220;This were well,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;O lord of the<br />
silver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;<br />
but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman&#8217;s breast, whereas<br />
Achilles is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and<br />
brought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to<br />
the immortals; you gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted<br />
along with them yourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of low<br />
company, that you have ever been.&#8221;<br />
Then said Jove, &#8220;Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be<br />
equal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,<br />
as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my<br />
altar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of<br />
sacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body<br />
of mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without<br />
Achilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day<br />
beside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I<br />
will impart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a<br />
ransom from Priam, and give up the body.&#8221;<br />
On this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down<br />
she plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;<br />
the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the<br />
bottom as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry<br />
death to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the<br />
other sea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst<br />
of them weeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own<br />
land, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said,<br />
&#8220;Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.&#8221;<br />
And Thetis answered, &#8220;Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great<br />
grief, and shrink from going in and out among the immortals. Still,<br />
I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be spoken in<br />
vain.&#8221;<br />
The goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more<br />
sombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. The<br />
waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore<br />
they flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son<br />
of Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.<br />
Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of<br />
father Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke<br />
to her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the<br />
cup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.<br />
&#8220;So, goddess,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for all your sorrow, and the grief that I<br />
well know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to<br />
Olympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days<br />
past the immortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of<br />
cities and the body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of<br />
Argus steal the body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity<br />
henceforward, I will concede such honour to your son as I will now<br />
tell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say<br />
that the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself more angry than<br />
them all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him<br />
up. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will<br />
send Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans,<br />
and ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may<br />
give him satisfaction.<br />
Silver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down<br />
she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her<br />
son&#8217;s tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty<br />
comrades round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which<br />
they had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him<br />
and caressed him with her hand saying, &#8220;My son, how long will you keep<br />
on thus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart,<br />
and think neither of food nor of woman&#8217;s embraces; and yet these too<br />
were well, for you have no long time to live, and death with the<br />
strong hand of fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed<br />
what I say, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods<br />
are angry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that<br />
you keep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let<br />
him go, and accept a ransom for his body.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion<br />
thus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.&#8221;<br />
Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse<br />
with one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the<br />
strong city of Ilius. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;fleet Iris, from the mansions of<br />
Olympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships<br />
of the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take<br />
such gifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he<br />
is to go alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured<br />
servant who may drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of<br />
him whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of<br />
death in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escort<br />
him, and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill<br />
him nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin<br />
not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.&#8221;<br />
On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her<br />
message. She went to Priam&#8217;s house, and found weeping and<br />
lamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in the<br />
outer courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat<br />
in the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and<br />
his head and neck all covered with the filth which he had clutched<br />
as he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters and his sons&#8217; wives<br />
went wailing about the house, as they thought of the many and brave<br />
men who lay dead, slain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by<br />
Priam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so.<br />
&#8220;Take heart,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and<br />
fear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I<br />
come as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes<br />
thought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and<br />
ransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give<br />
satisfaction to Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save<br />
only some honoured servant who may drive your mules and waggon, and<br />
bring back to the city the body of him whom noble Achilles has<br />
slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of death, for Jove will<br />
send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he has brought you within<br />
Achilles&#8217; tent, Achilles will not kill you nor let another do so,<br />
for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will entreat a<br />
suppliant with all honourable courtesy.&#8221;<br />
Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his<br />
sons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon<br />
fast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant<br />
store-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many<br />
treasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. &#8220;Wife,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;a messenger has come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the<br />
ships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts<br />
as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter?<br />
for my own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans<br />
and go to their ships.&#8221;<br />
His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, &#8220;Alas, what has<br />
become of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both<br />
among strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to<br />
the ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain<br />
so many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the<br />
cruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither<br />
respect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector from afar here in our own<br />
house, for when I gave him birth the threads of overruling fate were<br />
spun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in<br />
the house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten<br />
and devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice<br />
when Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right nor of avoiding<br />
battle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan women.&#8221;<br />
Then Priam said, &#8220;I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a<br />
bird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been<br />
some mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines<br />
from sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him no<br />
heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,<br />
therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be my<br />
fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;<br />
let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my<br />
arms and mourned him to my heart&#8217;s comforting.&#8221;<br />
So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve<br />
goodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve<br />
rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed<br />
out ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods,<br />
four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given<br />
him when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,<br />
but he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of<br />
his son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked<br />
them with words of anger. &#8220;Out,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;shame and disgrace to me<br />
that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to<br />
plague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn<br />
has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you<br />
shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have<br />
easier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the house<br />
of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city.&#8221;<br />
He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old<br />
man sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus,<br />
Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud<br />
battle-cry, Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old<br />
man call near him. &#8220;Come to me at once,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;worthless sons who<br />
do me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships rather<br />
than Hector. Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in<br />
all Troy- noble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector<br />
who was a god among men, so that one would have thought he was son<br />
to an immortal- yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them<br />
and those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light<br />
of foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your<br />
own people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and<br />
put all these things upon it that I may set out on my way?&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father.<br />
They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of<br />
the waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on<br />
which it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and<br />
rings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band<br />
eleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on<br />
at the far end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin<br />
making it fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob,<br />
and bending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, they<br />
brought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase<br />
the body of Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then<br />
they yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time<br />
given as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked<br />
horses which the old king had bred, and kept for own use.<br />
Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their<br />
cars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a<br />
golden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a<br />
drink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horses<br />
and said, &#8220;Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and<br />
since you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that<br />
you may come safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to the<br />
son of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down<br />
over all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right<br />
hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of<br />
all birds, that you may see it with your own eyes and trust it as<br />
you go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will<br />
not send you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I would<br />
not have you go to the ships of the Argives.&#8221;<br />
And Priam answered, &#8220;Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to<br />
lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.&#8221;<br />
With this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over<br />
his hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He<br />
washed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the<br />
drink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and<br />
turning his eyes to heaven. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that rulest<br />
from Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I may be received<br />
kindly and compassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send your<br />
swift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which is<br />
strongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with my<br />
own eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans.&#8221;<br />
So did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.<br />
Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds<br />
that fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His<br />
wings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and<br />
well-bolted door of a rich man&#8217;s chamber. He came to them flying<br />
over the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they<br />
were glad and their hearts took comfort within them. The old man<br />
made haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through the inner<br />
gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before him<br />
went the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise<br />
Idaeus; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed with<br />
his whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friends<br />
followed after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on his<br />
road to death. As soon as they had come down from the city and had<br />
reached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law who had followed him<br />
went back to Ilius.<br />
But Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not<br />
escape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man<br />
and pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, &#8220;Mercury,<br />
for it is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way,<br />
and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to<br />
the ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him<br />
nor take note of him until he reach the son of Peleus.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus,<br />
did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden<br />
sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he<br />
took the wand with which he seals men&#8217;s eyes in sleep, or wakes them<br />
just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to<br />
Troy and to the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of<br />
noble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down<br />
just coming upon his face.<br />
Now when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,<br />
they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,<br />
for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw<br />
Mercury standing near them he said to Priam, &#8220;Take heed, descendant of<br />
Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man<br />
who I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,<br />
or at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion<br />
upon us?<br />
When he heard this the old man&#8217;s heart failed him, and he was in<br />
great fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on<br />
end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him<br />
and took him by the hand, saying, &#8220;Whither, father, are you thus<br />
driving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other men<br />
are asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard<br />
by you, so cruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you<br />
bearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night,<br />
what would not your state then be? You are no longer young, and he who<br />
is with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack you.<br />
For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any<br />
one else, for you remind me of my own father.&#8221;<br />
And Priam answered, &#8220;It is indeed as you say, my dear son;<br />
nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent<br />
such a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so<br />
comely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so excellent that you<br />
must come of blessed parents.&#8221;<br />
Then said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, &#8220;Sir, all that<br />
you have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking<br />
this rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be<br />
safe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your<br />
son has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking<br />
in battle with the Achaeans?&#8221;<br />
And Priam said, &#8220;Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,<br />
that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?&#8221;<br />
The slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, &#8220;Sir, you<br />
would prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time<br />
have I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives<br />
to their ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and<br />
marvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered<br />
us not to fight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same<br />
ship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father&#8217;s name is Polyctor: he is a<br />
rich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons besides<br />
myself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and it fell upon me to<br />
sail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to the<br />
plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in array about<br />
the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that their<br />
princes cannot hold them back.&#8221;<br />
Then answered Priam, &#8220;If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son<br />
of Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the<br />
ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his<br />
hounds?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, &#8220;neither<br />
hounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at<br />
the tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days<br />
that he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms<br />
eaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags<br />
him cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him<br />
no hurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew,<br />
with the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them<br />
closed though many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the<br />
blessed gods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond<br />
all measure.&#8221;<br />
The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, &#8220;My son, see<br />
what a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals;<br />
for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold<br />
Olympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept<br />
therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with<br />
heaven&#8217;s help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.&#8221;<br />
Then answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, &#8220;Sir, you are<br />
tempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,<br />
for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles<br />
whom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil<br />
presently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to<br />
Argos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,<br />
that no one should attack you through making light of him who was with<br />
you.&#8221;<br />
The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and<br />
seizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and<br />
horses. When they reached the trench and the wall that was before<br />
the ships, those who were on guard had just been getting their<br />
suppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep.<br />
Then he drew back the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside<br />
with the treasure he had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to the<br />
lofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut<br />
pine and which they had built for their king; when they had built it<br />
they thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out<br />
on the plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, which<br />
was fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred with<br />
a single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place,<br />
and three to draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw<br />
it by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in<br />
the treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then<br />
he sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, &#8220;Sir, it is I,<br />
immortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to<br />
escort you. I will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence<br />
of Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriend<br />
mortal men thus openly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of the<br />
son of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his<br />
son; thus you may move him.&#8221;<br />
With these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang<br />
from his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge<br />
of the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house<br />
where Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him<br />
with his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero<br />
Automedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance<br />
about his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, and<br />
the table was still there. King Priam entered without their seeing<br />
him, and going right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed<br />
the dread murderous hands that had slain so many of his sons.<br />
As when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have<br />
killed some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man&#8217;s<br />
protection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so<br />
did Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to<br />
another and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, &#8220;Think<br />
of your father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I<br />
am, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell<br />
near him harass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from<br />
him. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his<br />
days are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home to<br />
him from Troy; but I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all<br />
Troy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty<br />
sons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a<br />
single womb, and the others were borne to me by the women of my<br />
household. The greater part of them has fierce Mars laid low, and<br />
Hector, him who was alone left, him who was the guardian of the city<br />
and ourselves, him have you lately slain; therefore I am now come to<br />
the ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a great<br />
ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your own<br />
father and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I<br />
have steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself before<br />
me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he<br />
bethought him of his father. He took the old man&#8217;s hand and moved<br />
him gently away. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at<br />
Achilles&#8217; feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles now for his father<br />
and now for Patroclous, till the house was filled with their<br />
lamentation. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and had<br />
unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat and<br />
raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair and<br />
beard; then he said, &#8220;Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatly<br />
daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the<br />
Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of<br />
your brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat,<br />
and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, for<br />
weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lot<br />
they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove&#8217;s palace<br />
there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other<br />
with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts<br />
he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to<br />
whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger<br />
of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,<br />
and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by<br />
gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him<br />
with all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the<br />
Myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal<br />
though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him<br />
too did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children<br />
born to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all<br />
untimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I<br />
must stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And<br />
you too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say<br />
that in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is in<br />
Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more<br />
inland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the<br />
day when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and<br />
slaughter have been about your city continually. Bear up against it,<br />
and let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for<br />
your brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from<br />
the dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.&#8221;<br />
And Priam answered, &#8220;O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is<br />
still lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom<br />
which I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look<br />
upon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land in<br />
safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon<br />
the light of the sun.&#8221;<br />
Achilles looked at him sternly and said, &#8220;Vex me, sir, no longer;<br />
I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother,<br />
daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me<br />
deliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot<br />
hide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans,<br />
for else, no man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to<br />
our host; he could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of<br />
my gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin<br />
against the word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you<br />
are, within my tents.&#8221;<br />
The old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang<br />
like a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him<br />
went his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than<br />
any others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These<br />
unyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam&#8217;s herald and attendant be<br />
seated within the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector&#8217;s body from<br />
the waggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that<br />
Achilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.<br />
Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and<br />
anoint it, but he first took it to a place where Priam should not<br />
see it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of<br />
his grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin<br />
against the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body and<br />
anointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles<br />
himself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the<br />
waggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear<br />
comrade, &#8220;Be not angry with me, Patroclus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you hear even<br />
in the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a<br />
ransom. It has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably<br />
with you.&#8221;<br />
Achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the<br />
richly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at<br />
right angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he<br />
said, &#8220;your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to<br />
desire; you shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the<br />
present let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think<br />
about eating, though her twelve children- six daughters and six<br />
lusty sons- had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons<br />
with arrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the<br />
daughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said<br />
Leto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne<br />
many- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie<br />
weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn<br />
turned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in<br />
heaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn<br />
out with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on the<br />
mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt the<br />
river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses<br />
the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir,<br />
let us two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter<br />
as you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many a tear will he cost<br />
you.&#8221;<br />
With this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of<br />
silvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in<br />
due order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted<br />
them, and drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon<br />
brought bread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while<br />
Achilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good<br />
things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat<br />
and drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength<br />
and beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles<br />
marvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble<br />
presence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. &#8220;And<br />
now, O king,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take me to my couch that we may lie down and<br />
enjoy the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed<br />
from the day your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelled<br />
without ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and<br />
brooding over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten<br />
bread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds<br />
in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red<br />
rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks<br />
for Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch<br />
and got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly<br />
to Priam, &#8220;Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of<br />
those who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see you<br />
here in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.<br />
This might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me<br />
and tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral<br />
rites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and<br />
restrain the host.&#8221;<br />
And Priam answered, &#8220;Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son<br />
with all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You<br />
know how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch<br />
wood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days,<br />
therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we<br />
will bury him and there shall be a public feast in his honour; on<br />
the eleventh we will build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth,<br />
if there be need, we will fight.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;All, King Priam, shall be as you have<br />
said. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he laid his hand on the old man&#8217;s right wrist, in<br />
token that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his<br />
attendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while<br />
Achilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his<br />
side.<br />
And now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the<br />
livelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck,<br />
sleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get<br />
King Priam away from the ships without his being seen by the strong<br />
force of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam&#8217;s head and said,<br />
&#8220;Sir, now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear<br />
about sleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great<br />
ransom, and have received the body of your son; were you still alive<br />
and a prisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have to<br />
give three times as much to free you; and so it would be if<br />
Agamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know of your being here.&#8221;<br />
When he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.<br />
Mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly<br />
through the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to<br />
the ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went<br />
back to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break<br />
over all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city<br />
lamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No<br />
one neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden<br />
Venus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his<br />
chariot, and his servant that was the city&#8217;s herald with him. Then she<br />
saw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a<br />
loud cry she went about the city saying, &#8220;Come hither Trojans, men and<br />
women, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from<br />
battle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our<br />
city and all our people.&#8221;<br />
At this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a<br />
sorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he<br />
was bringing in the body. Hector&#8217;s wife and his mother were the<br />
first to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid their<br />
hands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them. They<br />
would have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong<br />
day to the going down of the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from<br />
the chariot and said, &#8220;Make way for the mules to pass you.<br />
Afterwards when I have taken the body home you shall have your fill of<br />
weeping.&#8221;<br />
On this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon.<br />
When they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a<br />
bed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women<br />
joined in the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all<br />
Andromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty<br />
Hector in her embrace. &#8220;Husband,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you have died young, and<br />
leave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred<br />
parents is still a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood.<br />
Ere he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you who<br />
watched over it are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian of<br />
our wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives to the<br />
ships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me will<br />
be put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,<br />
some Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to<br />
avenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them<br />
have indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father&#8217;s hand in<br />
battle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have<br />
left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief<br />
is greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and<br />
embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might have<br />
lived with me in my tears night and day for evermore.&#8221;<br />
Bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.<br />
Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. &#8220;Hector,&#8221; she cried,<br />
&#8220;dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the<br />
gods loved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly<br />
unmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he<br />
would sell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos;<br />
and when he had slain you too with his sword, many a time did he<br />
drag you round the sepulchre of his comrade- though this could not<br />
give him life- yet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one<br />
whom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts.&#8221;<br />
Thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and<br />
then Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation.<br />
&#8220;Hector,&#8221; said she, &#8220;dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife<br />
to Alexandrus who brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere<br />
he did so- twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and<br />
came from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or<br />
unkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it might<br />
be one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers&#8217; wives, or my<br />
mother-in-law- for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own<br />
father- you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and<br />
goodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy<br />
self, for there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but all<br />
shrink and shudder as they go by me.&#8221;<br />
She wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her<br />
joined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, &#8220;Bring<br />
wood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the<br />
Argives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me<br />
his word that they should not attack us until the morning of the<br />
twelfth day.&#8221;<br />
Forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together<br />
before the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood,<br />
and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave<br />
Hector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and<br />
set the fire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered<br />
dawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round<br />
the pyre of mighty Hector. When they were got together, they first<br />
quenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his<br />
brothers and comrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white<br />
bones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden<br />
urn, which they placed in a grave and covered over with large stones<br />
set close together. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping<br />
guard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they<br />
had finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back<br />
again into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast<br />
in the house of Priam their king.<br />
Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of<br />
horses.</p>
