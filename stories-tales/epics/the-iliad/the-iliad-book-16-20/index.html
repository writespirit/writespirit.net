				<p>BOOK XVI </p>
<p>THUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus<br />
drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some<br />
spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.<br />
When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,<br />
&#8220;Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that<br />
comes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-<br />
she catches hold of her mother&#8217;s dress to stay her though she is in<br />
a hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- even<br />
such tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to<br />
say to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia<br />
which you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still<br />
alive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whose<br />
loss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the<br />
Argives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu<br />
their own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me<br />
that both of us may know about it.&#8221;<br />
Then, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,<br />
&#8220;Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be<br />
angry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the<br />
Argives. All those who have been their champions so far are lying at<br />
the ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has<br />
been hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received<br />
sword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in the<br />
thigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing<br />
them of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it<br />
never be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the<br />
baning of your own good name. Who in future story will speak well of<br />
you unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity;<br />
knight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey<br />
sea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and<br />
remorseless are you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of<br />
some oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something from<br />
the mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I<br />
may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your<br />
armour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the field, so<br />
that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have breathing time-<br />
which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might<br />
soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their own city.&#8221;<br />
He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own<br />
destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, &#8220;What, noble<br />
Patroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am<br />
heeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove,<br />
but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare<br />
to rob me because he is more powerful than I am. This, after all<br />
that I have gone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the<br />
sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear<br />
on having sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as<br />
though I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no<br />
man may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle<br />
and the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my<br />
armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the<br />
dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the<br />
Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow space,<br />
and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against<br />
them, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near<br />
them. Had they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip<br />
that had not been filled with their dead as they fled back again.<br />
And so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly<br />
by me. As it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of<br />
Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither<br />
have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated<br />
head, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives<br />
orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the<br />
whole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall<br />
upon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent<br />
us from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that<br />
you may win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they may<br />
restore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the<br />
bargain. When you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come back<br />
again. Though Juno&#8217;s thundering husband should put triumph within your<br />
reach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob<br />
me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go on<br />
killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the<br />
ever-living gods from Olympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo loves<br />
them well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and let<br />
others wage war upon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and<br />
Apollo, that not a single man of all the Trojans might be left<br />
alive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we two might be alone left<br />
to tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for<br />
the shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the<br />
javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed<br />
about his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles<br />
that kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected<br />
his face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his<br />
shield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they<br />
could not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the<br />
sweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment&#8217;s<br />
respite, and on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger.<br />
And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how<br />
fire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up<br />
and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He<br />
cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on to the<br />
shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless<br />
spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringing<br />
down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was<br />
dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless<br />
and was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and<br />
the Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in<br />
flame.<br />
The fire was now flaring about the ship&#8217;s stern, whereon Achilles<br />
smote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, &#8220;Up, noble knight, for I<br />
see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy<br />
our ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your<br />
armour at once while I call our people together.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs<br />
with greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;<br />
after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid<br />
and studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his<br />
shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his<br />
helmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded<br />
menacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his<br />
hands, but he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and<br />
strong, for none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles<br />
could do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,<br />
which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus,<br />
wherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his<br />
horses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour<br />
next after Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most<br />
firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius,<br />
steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy<br />
Podarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the<br />
waters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse<br />
Pedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the<br />
city of Eetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his<br />
place along with those that were immortal.<br />
Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade<br />
his Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves that<br />
are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the<br />
mountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to lap<br />
water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they<br />
reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is<br />
hunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors of the<br />
Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant of<br />
Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men and<br />
horses.<br />
Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there<br />
was a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom he<br />
could trust, while he was himself commander over them all.<br />
Menesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that<br />
streams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora<br />
daughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman<br />
mated with a god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, with<br />
whom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great<br />
wealth to gain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, son<br />
to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful<br />
dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as<br />
he saw her among the singing women at a dance held in honour of<br />
Diana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore-<br />
Mercury, giver of all good- went with her into an upper chamber, and<br />
lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus,<br />
singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess<br />
of the pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he<br />
saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor took the<br />
mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her father<br />
Phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondly<br />
upon him as though he were his own son. The third company was led by<br />
Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the<br />
Myrmidons next to Achilles&#8217; own comrade Patroclus. The old knight<br />
Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of<br />
Laerceus of the fifth.<br />
When Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with<br />
their captains, he charged them straitly saying, &#8220;Myrmidons,<br />
remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the<br />
ships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of me.<br />
&#8216;Cruel son of Peleus,&#8217; you would say, &#8216;your mother must have suckled<br />
you on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the ships<br />
against our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went home<br />
over the sea.&#8217; Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. The<br />
hour is now come for those high feats of arms that you have so long<br />
been pining for, therefore keep high hearts each one of you to do<br />
battle with the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they<br />
serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the of<br />
their king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some<br />
high house which is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely<br />
were the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield<br />
pressed on shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they<br />
that the horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets<br />
touched each other as they bent their heads.<br />
In front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and<br />
Automedon- two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then<br />
Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest<br />
which silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and<br />
which she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and<br />
good thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship,<br />
from which no man but himself might drink, nor would he make<br />
offering from it to any other god save only to father Jove. He took<br />
the cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulphur; this done he<br />
rinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine.<br />
Then he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards<br />
heaven, and making his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of<br />
Jove whose joy is in thunder. &#8220;King Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;lord of<br />
Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry<br />
Dodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around you<br />
with their feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground- if<br />
you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour while<br />
you sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment<br />
of yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships are<br />
lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of many<br />
Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go with him; put<br />
your courage into his heart that Hector may learn whether my squire is<br />
man enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then so<br />
indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when he<br />
has chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grant<br />
that he may return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades,<br />
fighters in close combat.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part of<br />
it he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that<br />
Patroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but<br />
refused to let him come safely out of the fight.<br />
When he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles<br />
went inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.<br />
Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce<br />
fight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.<br />
Meanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till<br />
they sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like<br />
wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to<br />
tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung- or<br />
again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,<br />
every wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-<br />
even with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their<br />
ships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called<br />
out to his men at the top of his voice, &#8220;Myrmidons, followers of<br />
Achilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and with<br />
main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the<br />
foremost man at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fighting<br />
followers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his<br />
folly in showing no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they<br />
fell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry<br />
which the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of<br />
Menoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were<br />
daunted and their battalions were thrown into confusion, for they<br />
thought the fleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and<br />
have been reconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked<br />
round about to see whither he might fly for safety.<br />
Patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men<br />
were packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.<br />
He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon<br />
and the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the<br />
right shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on<br />
this his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their<br />
leader, who was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck<br />
panic into them all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the<br />
fire that was then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where<br />
it was. The Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the<br />
skies, while the Danaans poured after them from their ships,<br />
shouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the<br />
thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty<br />
mountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest<br />
glades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting<br />
heavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire from<br />
their ships, they took breath for a little while; but the fury of<br />
the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back in<br />
utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their ground<br />
only by sheer fighting.<br />
The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed<br />
one another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius<br />
first drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was<br />
turning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so<br />
that he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest,<br />
where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The<br />
son of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could<br />
do so took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are<br />
thicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all the<br />
sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons<br />
of Nestor one, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of<br />
the spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on<br />
Antilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode<br />
the body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him,<br />
and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his<br />
blow; his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the<br />
root of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell<br />
heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did<br />
these two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the<br />
two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who<br />
had reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of<br />
Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled in<br />
the crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the<br />
neck. The sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the strong<br />
hand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.<br />
Peneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed<br />
each other with their spears. They had both thrown without effect,<br />
so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of<br />
Peneleos&#8217; helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote<br />
Lycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the<br />
head was held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life<br />
left in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up<br />
just as he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through<br />
his right shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes<br />
were closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the<br />
bronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,<br />
crashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were<br />
all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from<br />
both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,<br />
and the darkness of death enfolded him round about.<br />
Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his<br />
man. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when<br />
they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock<br />
through the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see this<br />
they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-<br />
even so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with<br />
ill-omened cries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.<br />
Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,<br />
but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well<br />
under cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the<br />
whizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well<br />
knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his<br />
ground and tried to protect his comrades.<br />
As when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a<br />
clear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken<br />
rout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.<br />
Hector&#8217;s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he<br />
left the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their<br />
will. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in<br />
the trench and left their master&#8217;s car behind them. Patroclus gave<br />
chase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against the<br />
Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways<br />
with their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the<br />
clouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in<br />
their flight from the tents and ships towards the city.<br />
Patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying<br />
in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being<br />
smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from<br />
his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose<br />
immortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench<br />
at a bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near<br />
Hector, for he had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector&#8217;s<br />
horses were now hurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before<br />
some tempest on an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish<br />
men for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justice<br />
therefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers run<br />
full and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong<br />
from the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of<br />
men- even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their<br />
flight.<br />
Patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and<br />
drove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach<br />
the city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between the<br />
river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then<br />
avenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was<br />
exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.<br />
Next he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up<br />
in his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been torn<br />
out of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into<br />
his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled<br />
him over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some<br />
jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook and<br />
a line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from his<br />
chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while falling.<br />
On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full on the<br />
head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside his helmet,<br />
whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death took<br />
hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,<br />
Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris,<br />
lpheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.<br />
Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,<br />
being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians<br />
saying. &#8220;Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I<br />
will myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so<br />
masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave<br />
man upon the ground.&#8221;<br />
He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw<br />
this, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another<br />
with loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream<br />
and tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.<br />
The son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said to<br />
Juno who was his wife and sister, &#8220;Alas, that it should be the lot<br />
of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of<br />
Patroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the<br />
fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or<br />
to let him now fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius.&#8221;<br />
And Juno answered, &#8220;Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that<br />
you are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long<br />
been fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not<br />
all of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your<br />
heart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of<br />
the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for<br />
there are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you<br />
will make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pity<br />
him, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as<br />
the life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him<br />
off the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his<br />
brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due<br />
honour to the dead.&#8221;<br />
The sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood<br />
upon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill<br />
on the rich plain of Troy far from his home.<br />
When they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck<br />
Thrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the<br />
belly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and<br />
missed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and<br />
it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life<br />
went out of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole of<br />
the chariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through the<br />
fall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew<br />
what to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that<br />
hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the<br />
other two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went<br />
together into battle.<br />
Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,<br />
the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting<br />
him. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his<br />
hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the<br />
ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall<br />
pine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to<br />
make timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at full<br />
length in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at<br />
the blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon a<br />
herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies<br />
bellowing in its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycian<br />
warriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He<br />
called on his trusty comrade and said, &#8220;Glaucus, my brother, hero<br />
among heroes, put forth all your strength, fight with might and<br />
main, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about<br />
among the Lycian captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; then<br />
yourself also do battle to save my armour from being taken. My name<br />
will haunt you henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my<br />
armour now that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmost<br />
and call all my people together.&#8221;<br />
Death closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his<br />
breast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out<br />
along with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon&#8217;s soul at<br />
the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who<br />
were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.<br />
Glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,<br />
for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other<br />
hand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer&#8217;s arrow had<br />
given him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was<br />
assailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying,<br />
&#8220;Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or<br />
may be in Troy, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one who<br />
is in distress, as I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is<br />
aching with pain, there is no staunching the blood, and my whole arm<br />
drags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go<br />
among my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove&#8217;s son Sarpedon, is<br />
slain. Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me<br />
of my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the<br />
Lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who has<br />
fallen.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,<br />
staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.<br />
Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had<br />
answered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian<br />
captains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From<br />
these he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous<br />
and Agenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he<br />
had found them he said, &#8220;Hector, you have utterly forgotten your<br />
allies, who languish here for your sake far from friends and home<br />
while you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian<br />
warriors has fallen- he who was at once the right and might of<br />
Lycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by<br />
him, my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his<br />
armour, nor to treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the<br />
Danaans whom we have speared at the ships.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable<br />
grief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main<br />
stays of their city, both as having much people with him, and<br />
himself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated<br />
by the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with<br />
all their might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of<br />
Menoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes,<br />
men who needed no bidding. &#8220;Ajaxes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;may it now please you<br />
to show youselves the men you have always been, or even better-<br />
Sarpedon is fallen- he who was first to overleap the wall of the<br />
Achaeans; let us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the armour<br />
from his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to rescue his<br />
body.&#8221;<br />
He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,<br />
therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the<br />
Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions,<br />
and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely<br />
the while. Mighty was the din of their armour as they came together,<br />
and Jove shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the of<br />
the battle over the body of his son.<br />
At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one<br />
of the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble<br />
Agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but<br />
presently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took<br />
refuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble<br />
steeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on<br />
the head with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and<br />
his brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell<br />
face foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was<br />
enraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front<br />
ranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or<br />
starlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make<br />
straight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith<br />
he struck Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone,<br />
and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this<br />
Hector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man<br />
can throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in<br />
battle- so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.<br />
Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by<br />
killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was the<br />
richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly, just<br />
as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, and<br />
drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell<br />
heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the<br />
Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up<br />
in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of<br />
their prowess, bore straight down upon them.<br />
Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son<br />
of Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by<br />
the people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the<br />
jaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death<br />
laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to<br />
hit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it<br />
coming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past<br />
him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on<br />
quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped<br />
from Aeneas&#8217;s hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas<br />
was angry and said, &#8220;Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit<br />
you my spear would soon have made an end of you.&#8221;<br />
And Meriones answered, &#8220;Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not<br />
be able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are<br />
only a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of<br />
your shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may<br />
be, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hades<br />
of the noble steeds.&#8221;<br />
On this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, &#8220;Meriones, hero<br />
though you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good<br />
friend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some<br />
of them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for<br />
council; fight, therefore, and say nothing.&#8221;<br />
He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As<br />
the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-<br />
and the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose<br />
from earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as<br />
men smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both<br />
ends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered<br />
was he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed<br />
about the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring<br />
when they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather round<br />
Sarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the<br />
fight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how<br />
best to kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be<br />
allowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and<br />
strip him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further<br />
trouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave<br />
squire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans<br />
back towards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he<br />
made Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and<br />
fled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales<br />
of Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians<br />
stand firm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck<br />
to the heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn made<br />
the fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore<br />
stripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of<br />
Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord of<br />
the storm-cloud said to Apollo, &#8220;Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and<br />
take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood<br />
from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash<br />
him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal<br />
raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet<br />
messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the<br />
rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and<br />
will raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the<br />
dead.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father&#8217;s saying, and came down from<br />
the heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took<br />
Sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way<br />
off, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia<br />
and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to<br />
the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who<br />
presently set him down in the rich land of Lycia.<br />
Meanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to<br />
Automedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and<br />
foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son<br />
of Peleus, he would have, escaped death and have been scatheless;<br />
but the counsels of Jove pass man&#8217;s understanding; he will put even<br />
a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again he<br />
will set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into<br />
the heart of Patroclus.<br />
Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when<br />
the gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,<br />
Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and<br />
Melanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes.<br />
These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.<br />
The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of<br />
Patroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus<br />
Apollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to<br />
aid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high<br />
wall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with<br />
his own immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for<br />
yet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,<br />
&#8220;Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of<br />
the Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is a<br />
far better man than you are.&#8221; On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to<br />
some distance and avoided the anger of Apollo.<br />
Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean<br />
gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to<br />
call the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo<br />
drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,<br />
who was Hector&#8217;s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of<br />
Dymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in<br />
his likeness Jove&#8217;s son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, &#8220;Hector,<br />
why have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as<br />
much better a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your<br />
slackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo<br />
may grant you a triumph over him, and you may rull him.&#8221;<br />
With this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade<br />
Cebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and<br />
struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the<br />
Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but<br />
drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot to<br />
the ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged<br />
stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,<br />
nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in<br />
vain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector&#8217;s charioteer, a bastard<br />
son of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him<br />
on the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was<br />
smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped<br />
dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was no<br />
more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight<br />
Patroclus, saying, &#8220;Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well<br />
he dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from<br />
the ship&#8217;s side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could<br />
stomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his<br />
chariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also<br />
among the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it<br />
were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck<br />
in the chest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O<br />
Patroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from<br />
his chariot to the ground. The pair then fought over the body of<br />
Cebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over<br />
the body of a stag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty<br />
warriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at<br />
one another over the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him<br />
go when he had once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast<br />
hold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans<br />
and Trojans. As the east and south wind buffet one another when they<br />
beat upon some dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ash<br />
and spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one<br />
another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even so<br />
did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about<br />
each other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell<br />
to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the<br />
body of Cebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield<br />
as they fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirling<br />
clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.<br />
So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of<br />
either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went<br />
down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved<br />
to be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of<br />
range of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the<br />
armour from his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce<br />
intent and a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill<br />
nine men; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O<br />
Patroclus, was the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought<br />
you in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in<br />
the crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck<br />
him from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat of<br />
his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the<br />
helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses&#8217;<br />
feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and<br />
blood. Never indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served<br />
to protect the head and comely forehead of the godlike hero<br />
Achilles. Now, however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector.<br />
Nevertheless the end of Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear,<br />
so great and so strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his<br />
shield that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did<br />
also the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his<br />
corslet.<br />
On this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he<br />
stood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the<br />
best spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest<br />
runner, came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear,<br />
midway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come<br />
up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in<br />
all the arts of war- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a<br />
weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then<br />
ran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the<br />
wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed<br />
though he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the<br />
blow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under<br />
cover of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to<br />
be wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and<br />
when close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly<br />
with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that he<br />
fell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a<br />
lion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fight<br />
furiously upon the mountains over some little fountain at which they<br />
would both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he can<br />
hardly breathe- even so did Hector son of Priam take the life of the<br />
brave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from close<br />
at hand, and vaunting over him the while. &#8220;Patroclus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you<br />
deemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of their<br />
freedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;<br />
Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend<br />
them. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of<br />
bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here.<br />
Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and<br />
yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying, &#8216;Come not<br />
back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent the<br />
bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body. Thus I ween did<br />
he charge you, and your fool&#8217;s heart answered him &#8216;yea&#8217; within you.&#8221;<br />
Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight<br />
Patroclus: &#8220;Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn<br />
and Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished<br />
me so easily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders;<br />
had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have<br />
fallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered<br />
me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the<br />
killing of me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too<br />
shall live but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are<br />
close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles<br />
son of Aeacus.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left<br />
his body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fate<br />
and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead<br />
though he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, &#8220;Patroclus, why<br />
should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of<br />
lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his<br />
foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He<br />
then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet<br />
descendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal<br />
steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him<br />
swiftly from the field.</p>
<p>
BOOK XVII</p>
<p>BRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had<br />
fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour<br />
to bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so<br />
did yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round<br />
shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who<br />
should dare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body,<br />
and came up to Menelaus saying, &#8220;Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back,<br />
leave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the<br />
Trojans and their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let<br />
me, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take<br />
aim and kill you.&#8221;<br />
To this Menelaus answered in great anger &#8220;By father Jove, boasting<br />
is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage<br />
wild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, than<br />
are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days<br />
of his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me the<br />
meanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to<br />
gladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an end of you<br />
too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not<br />
face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise after<br />
the event.&#8221;<br />
Euphorbus would not listen, and said, &#8220;Now indeed, Menelaus, shall<br />
you pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose<br />
wife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief<br />
unspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I<br />
bring your head and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and<br />
noble Phrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought<br />
out and settled, for me or against me.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did<br />
not go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took<br />
aim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing<br />
back, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning<br />
his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point<br />
went clean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as<br />
he fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the<br />
Graces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,<br />
were all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young<br />
olive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- the<br />
plant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every<br />
quarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some<br />
fierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- even<br />
so did Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after<br />
he had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the<br />
pride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it<br />
is feeding- first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then<br />
gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and<br />
cry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close to<br />
him, for they are pale with fear- even so no one had the courage to<br />
face valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off<br />
the armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollo<br />
been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited<br />
Hector to attack him. &#8220;Hector,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are now going after<br />
the horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them;<br />
they cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only by<br />
Achilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son<br />
of Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed the<br />
noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he can<br />
fight no more.&#8221;<br />
The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of<br />
Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks<br />
and saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing<br />
from his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this he<br />
made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming<br />
armour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard<br />
him, he said to himself in his dismay, &#8220;Alas! what shall I do? I may<br />
not let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen<br />
fighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame<br />
upon me. Still if for my honour&#8217;s sake I fight Hector and the<br />
Trojans single-handed, they will prove too many for me, for Hector<br />
is bringing them up in force. Why, however, should I thus hesitate?<br />
When a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a god<br />
befriends, he will soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I<br />
give place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I<br />
could find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, if<br />
we might only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus.<br />
This, of many evils would be the least.&#8221;<br />
While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with<br />
Hector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,<br />
turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and<br />
men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is<br />
daunted and slinks sulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus<br />
turn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body of his<br />
men, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently<br />
saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on his men and<br />
exhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a<br />
great panic among them. He ran up to him and said, &#8220;Ajax, my good<br />
friend, come with me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may<br />
take the body to Achilles- as for his armour, Hector already has it.&#8221;<br />
These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the<br />
front ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus of<br />
his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the<br />
body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his<br />
shield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter of<br />
his men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to the<br />
Trojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,<br />
therefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and<br />
bestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come<br />
upon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride and<br />
fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they<br />
cover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and<br />
by his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in<br />
his heart.<br />
Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and<br />
rebuked him sternly. &#8220;Hector,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you make a brave show, but in<br />
fight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to<br />
so great a reputation. Think how you may now save your town and<br />
citadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will<br />
get no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had<br />
for their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything<br />
to help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once<br />
your guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the<br />
Danaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city and<br />
yourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If<br />
the Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its<br />
fate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays<br />
hold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who<br />
would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could<br />
we get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the<br />
Argives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should<br />
get his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the<br />
foremost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting<br />
followers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor<br />
face him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver<br />
man than you are.&#8221;<br />
Hector scowled at him and answered, &#8220;Glaucus, you should know<br />
better. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any<br />
in all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of<br />
Ajax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove&#8217;s will<br />
is stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw<br />
back and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will set<br />
him on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and see<br />
indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as you<br />
say, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans from<br />
fighting round the body of Patroclus.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, &#8220;Trojans,<br />
Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends,<br />
and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of<br />
Achilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus.&#8221;<br />
With this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men<br />
who were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got<br />
far. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed<br />
his armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the<br />
Trojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,<br />
which the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son;<br />
but the son did not grow old in his father&#8217;s armour.<br />
When Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and<br />
arming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his<br />
head and muttered to himself saying, &#8220;A! poor wretch, you arm in the<br />
armour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck<br />
nothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have killed<br />
his comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that you should<br />
strip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you<br />
with great might now, but as against this you shall not return from<br />
battle to lay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.&#8221;<br />
The son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted<br />
the armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and<br />
filled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in<br />
among the allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed<br />
to all of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about<br />
among them and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon,<br />
Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys,<br />
Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did he exhort saying,<br />
&#8220;Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands,<br />
it was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called you<br />
hither each from his several city, but that with heart and soul you<br />
might defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from the<br />
fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my people with your food and<br />
the presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at the<br />
foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bring<br />
Patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of the Trojans, and shall<br />
make Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of the<br />
spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like honour with<br />
myself.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans<br />
with their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high<br />
that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body- fools<br />
that they were, for he was about to take the lives of many. Then<br />
Ajax said to Menelaus, &#8220;My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall<br />
hardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the<br />
body of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs and<br />
vultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector<br />
has wrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, and<br />
our destruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the<br />
Danaans if there is any who can hear us.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at<br />
the top of his voice. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;princes and counsellors<br />
of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the<br />
public cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes<br />
him power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot<br />
distinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, and<br />
think it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan<br />
hounds.&#8221;<br />
Fleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way<br />
through the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and<br />
Meriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that<br />
came into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them?<br />
The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a<br />
great wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born<br />
river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the<br />
breakers that beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the<br />
Trojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm<br />
about the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze<br />
shields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their helmets in a<br />
thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the son of Menoetius<br />
while he was still alive and squire to the descendant of Aeacus;<br />
therefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foes<br />
the Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend him.<br />
At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from<br />
the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any<br />
one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not<br />
lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of<br />
Peleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made<br />
towards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands<br />
at bay in the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that<br />
have attacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in<br />
among the phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had<br />
bestridden Patroclus and were most bent on winning glory by dragging<br />
him off to their city. At this moment Hippothous brave son of the<br />
Pelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging<br />
the body off by the foot through the press of the fight, having<br />
bound a strap round the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon<br />
befell him from which none of those could save him who would have<br />
gladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on<br />
his bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about the<br />
point of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong<br />
hand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the<br />
crest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus&#8217;<br />
foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body;<br />
thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and never repaid<br />
his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut short<br />
early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at Ajax with a<br />
spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the spear<br />
passed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of the<br />
Phoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much people; it<br />
struck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went<br />
right through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and<br />
his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.<br />
Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of<br />
the belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of<br />
his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails and he clutched<br />
the ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hector and those who<br />
were in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised a<br />
loud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous<br />
which they stripped presently of their armour.<br />
The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and<br />
driven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,<br />
so great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a<br />
triumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused<br />
Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who<br />
had grown old in the service of Aeneas&#8217; aged father, and was at all<br />
times devoted to him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, &#8220;Aeneas, can<br />
you not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save high<br />
Ilius? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance<br />
have saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case he<br />
would much rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would<br />
only fight instead of being so terribly afraid.&#8221;<br />
Aeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to<br />
Hector saying, &#8220;Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on us<br />
if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through<br />
our own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that<br />
Jove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for<br />
the Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead<br />
Patroclus to the ships.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then<br />
rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of<br />
Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with<br />
pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared<br />
Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under<br />
the midriff, so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was<br />
the best man of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward<br />
to avenge him and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be,<br />
inasmuch as those about Patroclus were well covered by their<br />
shields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had given<br />
them strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or to<br />
stand out before the others, but all were to hold well together<br />
about the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them,<br />
and the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on one<br />
another alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of<br />
the Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though<br />
many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend<br />
and stand by one another.<br />
Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though<br />
it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over<br />
all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead<br />
son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at<br />
their ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,<br />
and there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.<br />
These last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for<br />
they were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another&#8217;s<br />
weapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered both<br />
from battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn out<br />
by the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,<br />
Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of<br />
Patroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading the van<br />
against the Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against<br />
the death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered<br />
when he sent them from the ships into battle.<br />
Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the<br />
sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their<br />
hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of<br />
Peleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat<br />
to his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a<br />
ring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the<br />
many that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the two<br />
sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but a<br />
little space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius,<br />
while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and<br />
fierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts,<br />
nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a<br />
battle.<br />
Such fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain<br />
round the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that he<br />
had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off<br />
the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, and<br />
deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to<br />
the gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with nor<br />
without himself, for his mother had often told him this when he had<br />
sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of<br />
great Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster<br />
had befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him of<br />
all his comrades.<br />
The others still kept on charging one another round the body with<br />
their pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, &#8220;My<br />
friends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and<br />
greatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in this<br />
place, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing<br />
off Patroclus to their city.&#8221;<br />
The Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,<br />
&#8220;Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink<br />
from fighting.&#8221; With such words did they exhort each other. They<br />
fought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the void air to<br />
the brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus<br />
stood out of the fight and wept when they heard that their driver<br />
had been laid low by the hand of murderous Hector. Automedon,<br />
valiant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; many a time did he<br />
speak kindly to them, and many a time did he upbraid them, but they<br />
would neither go back to the ships by the waters of the broad<br />
Hellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood with<br />
their chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some<br />
dead man or woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell<br />
from their eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and<br />
their noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on<br />
either side the yoke.<br />
The son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He<br />
wagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, &#8220;Poor things, why<br />
did we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are<br />
yourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the<br />
sorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move<br />
upon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector son<br />
of Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it.<br />
It is enough that he should have the armour over which he vaunts so<br />
vainly. Furthermore I will give you strength of heart and limb to bear<br />
Automedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans<br />
triumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;<br />
whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that<br />
they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot<br />
swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind<br />
them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture<br />
amid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he<br />
dashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his<br />
pursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and keep<br />
his horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, a<br />
comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of him<br />
and came up behind his chariot. &#8220;Automedon,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what god has<br />
put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that<br />
you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was your<br />
comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in the<br />
armour of the descendant of Aeacus.&#8221;<br />
Automedon son of Diores answered, &#8220;Alcimedon, there is no one else<br />
who can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save<br />
only Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel. Take then<br />
the whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.<br />
Alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and<br />
reins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he<br />
said to Aeneas who was near him, &#8220;Aeneas, counsellor of the<br />
mail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come<br />
into battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think<br />
well, that we might take them; they will not dare face us if we both<br />
attack them.&#8221;<br />
The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair<br />
went right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry<br />
ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also with<br />
them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill the<br />
men and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were not to<br />
return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to<br />
father Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength<br />
abounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said,<br />
&#8220;Alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that I may feel their<br />
breath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of<br />
Priam till he has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he will<br />
then either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself<br />
be killed among the foremost.&#8221;<br />
On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, &#8220;Ajaxes<br />
captains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them<br />
that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us<br />
living; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among the<br />
Trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless<br />
the issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear<br />
and leave the rest to Jove.&#8221;<br />
He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round<br />
shield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed it<br />
not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of his<br />
belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behind<br />
the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so<br />
that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give one<br />
bound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till<br />
it made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he<br />
saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past<br />
him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on<br />
quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have<br />
fought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their<br />
way through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and<br />
parted them for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius<br />
were afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the<br />
heart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his<br />
armour and vaunted over him saying, &#8220;I have done little to assuage<br />
my sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have killed is not<br />
so good as he was.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon<br />
his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all<br />
steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.<br />
And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for<br />
Minerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of<br />
far-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage<br />
the Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token to<br />
mankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from<br />
their labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant<br />
raiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to<br />
each. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to<br />
Menelaus son of Atreus, who was standing near her. &#8220;Menelaus,&#8221; said<br />
she, &#8220;it will be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble<br />
comrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and<br />
urge your men to be so also.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus answered, &#8220;Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva<br />
vouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I<br />
stand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but<br />
Hector is as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for<br />
Jove is now granting him a time of triumph.&#8221;<br />
Minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the<br />
other gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,<br />
and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet<br />
come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man&#8217;s blood-<br />
even so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and<br />
threw his spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes,<br />
son of Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the<br />
highest honour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of<br />
Menelaus struck this man in the girdle just as he had turned in<br />
flight, and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward,<br />
and Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the<br />
ranks of his own people.<br />
Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the<br />
likeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the most<br />
favoured of all Hector&#8217;s guests. In his likeness Apollo said, &#8220;Hector,<br />
who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you have<br />
quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?<br />
Yet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and<br />
has slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes<br />
son of Eetion.<br />
A dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made<br />
his way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn<br />
seized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent<br />
forth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he<br />
gave victory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.<br />
The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping<br />
his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on<br />
the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed<br />
the top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him<br />
from close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son of<br />
noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from<br />
fighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never<br />
again should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector<br />
was in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over<br />
his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the<br />
Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion<br />
as he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but<br />
the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who<br />
had come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot<br />
and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus had<br />
not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue<br />
to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. For<br />
Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove<br />
out his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from<br />
his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gathered<br />
them up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he said<br />
to Idomeneus, &#8220;Lay on, till you get back to the ships, for you must<br />
see that the day is no longer ours.&#8221;<br />
On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken<br />
hold upon him.<br />
Ajax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of<br />
the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;even a<br />
fool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their<br />
weapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward<br />
that hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one<br />
of them without effect. What, then, will be best both as regards<br />
rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will<br />
be grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that<br />
nothing can now check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he will<br />
fling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell<br />
the son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard<br />
the sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see<br />
not a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots<br />
are alike hidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over<br />
the sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you<br />
will that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.&#8221;<br />
Father Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith<br />
he chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and<br />
all the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, &#8220;Look,<br />
Menelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him at<br />
once to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his<br />
comrades has fallen.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a<br />
stockyard- the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep<br />
watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of<br />
their herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,<br />
for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt<br />
him for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away- even<br />
so did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great fear<br />
lest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall<br />
into the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes<br />
straitly saying, &#8220;Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now<br />
indeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while<br />
alive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.&#8221;<br />
With this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an<br />
eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird-<br />
however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape<br />
him by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it<br />
and make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range<br />
round the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the<br />
son of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme<br />
left of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight<br />
boldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, &#8220;Antilochus, come here and<br />
listen to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see<br />
with your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,<br />
and giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the<br />
bravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run<br />
instantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue<br />
the body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already<br />
has it.&#8221;<br />
Antilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was<br />
speechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance,<br />
but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had<br />
given his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses<br />
round, close beside him.<br />
Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news<br />
to Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour<br />
his harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and<br />
greatly did they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and<br />
himself went back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes<br />
and said, &#8220;I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but<br />
rage against Hector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight<br />
without armour. What then will be our best plan both as regards<br />
rescuing the dead, and our own escape from death amid the battle-cries<br />
of the Trojans?&#8221;<br />
Ajax answered, &#8220;Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and<br />
Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,<br />
while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in<br />
heart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with one<br />
another.&#8221;<br />
On this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and<br />
lifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised a<br />
hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body<br />
away, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at<br />
the loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him<br />
as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on<br />
them in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions- even so<br />
did the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with sword<br />
and with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes<br />
faced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared<br />
press on to fight further about the dead.<br />
In this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the<br />
body to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like<br />
fierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city,<br />
and the houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the<br />
roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore<br />
Patroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth all their<br />
strength to draw some beam or great piece of ship&#8217;s timber down a<br />
rough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as they, go even so<br />
did Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus.<br />
Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded<br />
mountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water and<br />
check the flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strong<br />
enough to break through it- even so did the two Ajaxes face the<br />
Trojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they kept<br />
pouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas son<br />
of Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of daws or starlings<br />
fall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to i&#8217;ll<br />
small birds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean youth<br />
raise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector,<br />
unmindful of their former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans much<br />
goodly armour fell round about the trench, and of fighting there was<br />
no end.</p>
<p>
BOOK XVIII</p>
<p>THUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the<br />
fleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached<br />
Achilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that<br />
which was indeed too surely true. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he to himself in the<br />
heaviness of his heart, &#8220;why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain<br />
and flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now<br />
bringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying<br />
that while I was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall<br />
before the Trojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the<br />
brave son of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I<br />
bade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those<br />
that were bringing fire against them, and not join battle with<br />
Hector.&#8221;<br />
As he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and<br />
told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; he cried,<br />
&#8220;son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that<br />
they were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about<br />
his naked body- for Hector holds his armour.&#8221;<br />
A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled<br />
both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,<br />
disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his<br />
shirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at<br />
full length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom<br />
Achilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,<br />
beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.<br />
Antilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands<br />
as he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into his<br />
own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him<br />
as she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,<br />
whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus that<br />
dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were<br />
Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed Halie,<br />
Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave,<br />
Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and<br />
Callianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea,<br />
Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira<br />
and Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with<br />
other Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was<br />
filled with their multitude and they all beat their breasts while<br />
Thetis led them in their lament.<br />
&#8220;Listen,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may<br />
hear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have<br />
borne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero<br />
among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant<br />
in a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight<br />
the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of<br />
Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in<br />
heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I<br />
will go, that I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen<br />
him though he is still holding aloof from battle.&#8221;<br />
She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping<br />
after, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached<br />
the rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line<br />
on to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were<br />
drawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went<br />
up to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and<br />
spoke piteously, saying, &#8220;My son, why are you thus weeping? What<br />
sorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove<br />
has granted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands<br />
and besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at<br />
their ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with<br />
them.&#8221;<br />
Achilles groaned and answered, &#8220;Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed<br />
vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,<br />
seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued<br />
more than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have<br />
lost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous<br />
armour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they<br />
laid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still<br />
dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to<br />
himself some mortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by<br />
reason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home-<br />
nay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall<br />
by my spear, and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of<br />
Menoetius.&#8221;<br />
Thetis wept and answered, &#8220;Then, my son, is your end near at hand-<br />
for your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.&#8221;<br />
Then said Achilles in his great grief, &#8220;I would die here and now, in<br />
that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, and<br />
in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there<br />
for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought no<br />
saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many<br />
have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless<br />
burden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the<br />
Achaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish<br />
strife both from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a<br />
righteous man will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of a<br />
man like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of<br />
honey. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for it<br />
is over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I<br />
will go; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so<br />
dearly, and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the<br />
other gods to send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even<br />
he could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno&#8217;s fierce<br />
anger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom<br />
awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan and<br />
Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both their<br />
hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall they<br />
know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.<br />
Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall<br />
not move me.&#8221;<br />
Then silver-footed Thetis answered, &#8220;My son, what you have said is<br />
true. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your<br />
armour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon<br />
his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not be<br />
lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press<br />
of battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I<br />
shall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan.&#8221;<br />
On this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to<br />
the sea-nymphs her sisters, &#8220;Dive into the bosom of the sea and go<br />
to the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for<br />
me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask<br />
him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour.&#8221;<br />
When she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,<br />
while silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the<br />
armour for her son.<br />
Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and<br />
meanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous<br />
Hector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they<br />
could not draw the body of Mars&#8217;s servant Patroclus out of reach of<br />
the weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam<br />
with his host and horsemen had again caught up to him like the flame<br />
of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet,<br />
striving with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly on<br />
the Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour as<br />
with a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted he would<br />
now charge into the thick of the fight, and now again he would stand<br />
still and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As upland<br />
shepherds that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even so<br />
could not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body of<br />
Patroclus.<br />
And now he would even have dragged it off and have won<br />
imperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way<br />
as messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She<br />
came secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for<br />
Juno sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, &#8220;Up, son of<br />
Peleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this<br />
fearful fight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another,<br />
the Danaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are<br />
trying to hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is the<br />
most furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and<br />
fixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no<br />
longer; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat for the<br />
dogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of<br />
outrage.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles said, &#8220;Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you<br />
to me?&#8221;<br />
Iris answered, &#8220;It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son of<br />
Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the<br />
immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.&#8221;<br />
Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, &#8220;How can I go up into the<br />
battle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should<br />
see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from<br />
Vulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of<br />
Ajax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front<br />
rank and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.&#8221;<br />
Iris said, &#8216;We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you<br />
are; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that<br />
they may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of<br />
the Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may<br />
hardly be.&#8221;<br />
Iris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove<br />
arose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong<br />
shoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which<br />
she kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into<br />
heaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an island far out<br />
at sea- all day long do men sally from the city and fight their<br />
hardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires<br />
blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold,<br />
if so be that they may come with their ships and succour them- even so<br />
did the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the<br />
trench, going beyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for he<br />
heeded the charge which his mother laid upon him.<br />
There did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice<br />
from afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing as<br />
the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates<br />
of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when<br />
the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses<br />
turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their<br />
drivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed<br />
goddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.<br />
Thrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,<br />
and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into<br />
confusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath<br />
the wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears. The<br />
Achaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the<br />
weapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round<br />
him, and among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his<br />
true comrade lying dead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses<br />
and chariots into battle, but his return he was not to welcome.<br />
Then Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters<br />
of Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and<br />
turmoil of war.<br />
Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their<br />
horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They<br />
kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen<br />
upon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held<br />
aloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to<br />
speak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before<br />
and after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the<br />
same night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed<br />
them thus:-<br />
&#8220;Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to<br />
your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are<br />
far from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon<br />
the Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladly<br />
camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go in<br />
great fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will<br />
never bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight<br />
with equal valour, but he will try to storm our city and carry off our<br />
women. Do then as I say, and let us retreat. For this is what will<br />
happen. The darkness of night will for a time stay the son of<br />
Peleus, but if he find us here in the morning when he sallies forth in<br />
full armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad<br />
indeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many a<br />
Trojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear<br />
it. If we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall have<br />
strength in counsel during the night, and the great gates with the<br />
doors that close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and<br />
take our stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from<br />
the ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horses<br />
their fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will be<br />
in no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither will he<br />
ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.&#8221;<br />
Hector looked fiercely at him and answered, &#8220;Polydamas, your words<br />
are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the<br />
city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In<br />
the old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its<br />
wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our<br />
houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,<br />
for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,<br />
that the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here<br />
and to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this<br />
fool&#8217;s wise among the people. You will have no man with you; it<br />
shall not be; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in your<br />
companies throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful<br />
every man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let<br />
him gather them and give them out among the people. Better let<br />
these, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm<br />
and fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again come<br />
forward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard<br />
with him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to fall or<br />
conquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and the<br />
slayer may yet be slain.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in<br />
applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.<br />
They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of<br />
Polydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout the<br />
host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned<br />
Patroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his<br />
murderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again and<br />
again as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed him<br />
of his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he is<br />
furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can<br />
find him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh did<br />
Achilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, &#8220;Alas! vain were the<br />
words with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said<br />
that I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had<br />
sacked Ilius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give<br />
all men their heart&#8217;s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here<br />
at Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed<br />
home by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in<br />
this place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now<br />
that I am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought<br />
hither the head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you.<br />
Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to<br />
avenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships,<br />
and fair women of Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and<br />
strength of arm when we sacked men&#8217;s goodly cities, shall weep over<br />
you both night and day.&#8221;<br />
Then Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire<br />
that they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they<br />
set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw<br />
sticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the<br />
flame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in the<br />
cauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and<br />
closed its wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then<br />
they laid it on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head<br />
to foot, and over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all night<br />
long did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus.<br />
Then Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, &#8220;So, Queen Juno, you have<br />
gained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think<br />
that the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.&#8221;<br />
And Juno answered, &#8220;Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this<br />
thing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we<br />
do, do what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of<br />
all goddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in<br />
heaven- devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of<br />
Vulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in<br />
heaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god&#8217;s own hands. She<br />
found him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was<br />
making twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and<br />
he set wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own<br />
selves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvels<br />
indeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning<br />
workmanship which yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was now<br />
fixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at<br />
work silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful<br />
head-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon<br />
as she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, &#8220;Why have you<br />
come to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not<br />
visit us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before you.&#8221;<br />
The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a<br />
richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also<br />
under her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, &#8220;Vulcan, come here,<br />
Thetis wants you&#8221;; and the far-famed lame god answered, &#8220;Then it is<br />
indeed an august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was<br />
that took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which<br />
I had through my cruel mother&#8217;s anger- for she would have got rid of<br />
me because I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not<br />
Eurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and<br />
Thetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them,<br />
and many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,<br />
and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring waters<br />
of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew,<br />
neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care<br />
of me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her due<br />
requital for having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with all<br />
hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools.&#8221;<br />
On this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs<br />
plying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and<br />
gathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and<br />
washed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned<br />
his shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.<br />
There were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like<br />
real young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,<br />
and all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as<br />
the king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon a<br />
goodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, &#8220;Why have you<br />
come to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do not<br />
visit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once if<br />
I can, and if it can be done at all.&#8221;<br />
Thetis wept and answered, &#8220;Vulcan, is there another goddess in<br />
Olympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much<br />
affliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he<br />
make subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely<br />
against my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was but<br />
mortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is this<br />
all. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up<br />
as a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and sent<br />
him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall I<br />
welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look<br />
upon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go to<br />
him I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up the<br />
maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes<br />
with sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in at<br />
their ships&#8217; sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders,<br />
therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him great<br />
treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, but<br />
put his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight with<br />
much people after him. All day long they fought by the Scaean gates<br />
and would have taken the city there and then, had not Apollo<br />
vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoetius<br />
after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant at<br />
your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end is<br />
near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fitted<br />
with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own when<br />
his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies<br />
stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.&#8221;<br />
And Vulcan answered, &#8220;Take heart, and be no more disquieted about<br />
this matter; would that I could hide him from death&#8217;s sight when his<br />
hour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze<br />
the eyes of all who behold it.&#8221;<br />
When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning<br />
them towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows<br />
blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some<br />
fierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as<br />
Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into<br />
the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its<br />
block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the<br />
tongs in the other.<br />
First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over<br />
and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and<br />
the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five<br />
thicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.<br />
He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her<br />
full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of<br />
heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men<br />
also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.<br />
Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.<br />
He wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of<br />
men. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were<br />
going about the city with brides whom they were escorting by<br />
torchlight from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the<br />
youths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women stood<br />
each at her house door to see them.<br />
Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a<br />
quarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man<br />
who had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid<br />
damages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was<br />
trying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each<br />
man backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them<br />
back, and the elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn<br />
circle, holding the staves which the heralds had put into their hands.<br />
Then they rose and each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two<br />
talents laid down, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed<br />
the fairest.<br />
About the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming<br />
armour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and<br />
accept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city would<br />
not yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives<br />
and little children kept guard upon the walls, and with them were<br />
the men who were past fighting through age; but the others sallied<br />
forth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wrought<br />
in gold and clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour<br />
as befitting gods, while they that followed were smaller. When they<br />
reached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was on a<br />
riverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and near<br />
to water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some<br />
way off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the<br />
coming of sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by two<br />
shepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a<br />
thought of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut<br />
off the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile the<br />
besiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they sat<br />
in council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed towards<br />
them; when they reached them they set battle in array by the banks<br />
of the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one<br />
another. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who was<br />
dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the other<br />
unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging him along by<br />
his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men&#8217;s blood. They went in and<br />
out with one another and fought as though they were living people<br />
haling away one another&#8217;s dead.<br />
He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed<br />
already. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning<br />
their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned<br />
on reaching the headland a man would come up to them and give them a<br />
cup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forward<br />
to the time when they should again reach the headland. The part that<br />
they had ploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it<br />
was of gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curious<br />
to behold.<br />
He wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were<br />
reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to<br />
the ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound<br />
them in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind<br />
them there were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept<br />
on bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the land<br />
stood by in silence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal<br />
ready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were<br />
busy cutting him up, while the women were making a porridge of much<br />
white barley for the labourers&#8217; dinner.<br />
He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines<br />
were loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the<br />
vines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal<br />
all round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one<br />
path to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather<br />
the vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried<br />
the luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went a<br />
boy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with<br />
his clear boyish voice.<br />
He wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and<br />
tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go and<br />
feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along<br />
with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and<br />
their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had<br />
fastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and<br />
bellow as he might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave<br />
chase: the lions tore through the bull&#8217;s thick hide and were gorging<br />
on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to do<br />
anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on<br />
the lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm&#8217;s way.<br />
The god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large<br />
flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.<br />
Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made<br />
in Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and<br />
maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another&#8217;s<br />
wrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well<br />
woven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with<br />
garlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that hung by<br />
silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring with<br />
merry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work and<br />
making trial of his wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimes<br />
they would go all in line with one another, and much people was<br />
gathered joyously about the green. There was a bard also to sing to<br />
them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in<br />
the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.<br />
All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream<br />
of the river Oceanus.<br />
Then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a<br />
breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,<br />
close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume<br />
overhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.<br />
Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took<br />
it and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a<br />
falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming<br />
armour from the house of Vulcan.</p>
<p>
BOOK XIX</p>
<p>NOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of<br />
Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the<br />
ships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son<br />
fallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also<br />
of his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came<br />
among them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, &#8220;My son, grieve as<br />
we may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven&#8217;s will that he<br />
has fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly<br />
armour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out<br />
bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none<br />
dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused<br />
to still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for<br />
he was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had<br />
made him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at<br />
it, he said to his mother, &#8220;Mother, the god has given me armour,<br />
meet handiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have<br />
fashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon<br />
the son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his<br />
body, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.&#8221;<br />
Silver-footed Thetis answered, &#8220;My son, be not disquieted about this<br />
matter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome<br />
flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.<br />
He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound<br />
as ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in<br />
assembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight<br />
with might and main.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she<br />
then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,<br />
that his body might suffer no change.<br />
Then Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called<br />
on the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always<br />
at the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who<br />
were about the ships and served out rations, all came to the place<br />
of assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof<br />
so long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of<br />
Tydeus, came limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless<br />
they came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last<br />
of all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of<br />
Antenor had struck him with a spear in battle.<br />
When the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, &#8220;Son<br />
of Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,<br />
when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would<br />
have been better, had Diana&#8217;s arrow slain her at the ships on the<br />
day when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an<br />
Achaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days<br />
of my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the<br />
Achaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it<br />
be, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooled<br />
our anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever;<br />
therefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against<br />
the Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by<br />
the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may<br />
fly my spear when I wield it.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away<br />
his anger.<br />
Then Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the<br />
middle of the assembly. &#8220;Danaan heroes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;servants of Mars,<br />
it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not<br />
seemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised<br />
speaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest<br />
orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of<br />
Peleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have<br />
the Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it<br />
was not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in<br />
darkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took<br />
from Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could I<br />
do? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of<br />
Jove&#8217;s daughters, shuts men&#8217;s eyes to their destruction. She walks<br />
delicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men<br />
to make them stumble or to ensnare them.<br />
&#8220;Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest<br />
whether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him<br />
on the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair<br />
city of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, &#8216;Hear me all<br />
gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day<br />
shall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man<br />
child into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him<br />
who are of my blood and lineage.&#8217; Then said Juno all crafty and full<br />
of guile, &#8216;You will play false, and will not hold to your word.<br />
Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this<br />
day fall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that<br />
dwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great<br />
oath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high<br />
summit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew<br />
that the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being<br />
with child and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth<br />
though there was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring<br />
of Alcmena, and kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove<br />
the son of Saturn, and said, &#8216;Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I<br />
have a word for your ear. There is a fine child born this day,<br />
Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your<br />
lineage; it is well, therefore, that he should reign over the<br />
Argives.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught<br />
Folly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she<br />
again invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all.<br />
Then he whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down<br />
from heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he<br />
was ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel<br />
labours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when<br />
mighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time<br />
I kept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove<br />
robbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much<br />
treasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your<br />
people with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you<br />
yesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you<br />
would fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my<br />
ship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you<br />
can give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:<br />
it is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not<br />
well to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as<br />
yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,<br />
and laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of<br />
you when he is fighting.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the<br />
Achaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the<br />
battle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has<br />
filled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and<br />
wine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man<br />
can do battle the livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is<br />
without food; however much he may want to fight his strength will fail<br />
him before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his<br />
limbs will grow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he<br />
is full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength<br />
will stay till he has routed all his foes; therefore, send the<br />
people away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring<br />
out the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see them and<br />
you may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the<br />
Argives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor<br />
been with her after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show<br />
yourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his<br />
tents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your<br />
dues in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously<br />
in future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends<br />
if he was wrong in the first instance.&#8221;<br />
And King Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Son of Laertes, your words please me<br />
well, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would<br />
have me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name<br />
of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain<br />
fight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from<br />
my tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge<br />
you: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my<br />
tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the<br />
women also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those<br />
that are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to<br />
the sun.&#8221;<br />
Then said Achilles, &#8220;Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to<br />
these matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and<br />
when I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those<br />
whom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the<br />
plain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and<br />
without food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going<br />
down of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying<br />
dead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and<br />
his comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought of<br />
nothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat<br />
of the dying.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the<br />
Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a<br />
little, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of<br />
greater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is<br />
a thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward,<br />
weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the straw which our<br />
sickles have reaped is far heavier than the grain. It may not be<br />
that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with their bellies; day by day<br />
men fall thick and threefold continually; when should we have<br />
respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day and bury them<br />
out of sight and mind, but let those of us who are left eat and<br />
drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hour<br />
let no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shall<br />
bode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us<br />
rather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with<br />
Meges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,<br />
and Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The<br />
word was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out<br />
the seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty<br />
metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women<br />
skilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made<br />
eight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the<br />
way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts,<br />
and laid them in the middle of the assembly.<br />
Agamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a<br />
god came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife<br />
which he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by<br />
cutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in<br />
prayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent<br />
and orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of<br />
heaven and prayed saying, &#8220;I call Jove the first and mightiest of<br />
all gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who<br />
dwell below and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that<br />
I have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my<br />
bed nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If<br />
I swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties which it<br />
metes out to those who perjure themselves.&#8221;<br />
He cut the boar&#8217;s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled<br />
it round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the<br />
fishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, &#8220;Father Jove,<br />
of a truth you blind men&#8217;s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had<br />
not else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken<br />
Briseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled<br />
the destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we<br />
may begin fighting.&#8221;<br />
On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own<br />
ship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the<br />
ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the<br />
stable-men drove the horses in among the others.<br />
Briseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of<br />
Patroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her<br />
breast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful<br />
as a goddess she wept and said, &#8220;Patroclus, dearest friend, when I<br />
went hence I left you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead;<br />
thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one after the other. I saw<br />
him to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our city,<br />
and my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day;<br />
but you, Patroclus, even when Achilles slew my husband and sacked<br />
the city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for you<br />
said you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him to<br />
Phthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You were<br />
always kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for you.&#8221;<br />
She wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making<br />
as though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was<br />
weeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round<br />
Achilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not<br />
do so. &#8220;I pray you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if any comrade will hear me, bid me<br />
neither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay<br />
fasting even to the going down of the sun.&#8221;<br />
On this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of<br />
Atreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who<br />
stayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his<br />
sorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have flung<br />
himself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking<br />
ever of Patroclus. Then he said-<br />
&#8220;Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner<br />
ready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were<br />
hasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and<br />
drink in my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this<br />
I could not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my<br />
father, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who<br />
am here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake<br />
of Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- he<br />
who is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is still<br />
living. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy<br />
away from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my son<br />
with you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my<br />
bondsmen, and the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be<br />
either dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alike<br />
with the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should<br />
hear the sad tidings of my death.&#8221;<br />
He wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each<br />
thought on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn<br />
looked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, &#8220;My<br />
child, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out<br />
of your recollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for<br />
the loss of his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to<br />
their dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar<br />
and ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no hunger.&#8221;<br />
With these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.<br />
She darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on<br />
his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming<br />
throughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and<br />
ambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his<br />
limbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her mighty father.<br />
Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on<br />
the keen blasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming<br />
helmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the<br />
ashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the<br />
whole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of<br />
the tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst<br />
of them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes<br />
gleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,<br />
then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the<br />
god, the armour that Vulcan had made him.<br />
First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and<br />
next he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the<br />
silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up<br />
the shield so great and strong that shone afar with a splendour as<br />
of the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men<br />
have lit a fire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but<br />
the sailors are carried out to sea by wind and storm far from the<br />
haven where they would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles&#8217; wondrous<br />
shield strike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet,<br />
and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the<br />
golden plumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the<br />
helmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in<br />
his armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could<br />
play freely under it, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had<br />
been wings.<br />
He also drew his father&#8217;s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so<br />
great and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only<br />
Achilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash<br />
from the topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given<br />
to Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus<br />
busied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the<br />
bands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the<br />
reins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up<br />
behind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour,<br />
resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he<br />
chided with his father&#8217;s horses saying, &#8220;Xanthus and Balius, famed<br />
offspring of Podarge- this time when we have done fighting be sure and<br />
bring your driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do<br />
not leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroclus.&#8221;<br />
Then fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno had<br />
endowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane<br />
touched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. &#8220;Dread<br />
Achilles,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we will indeed save you now, but the day of<br />
your death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be<br />
heaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through<br />
any sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus<br />
of his armour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew<br />
him as he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to<br />
Hector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest<br />
of all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a<br />
man and of a god.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles<br />
answered him in great sadness, saying, &#8220;Why, O Xanthus, do you thus<br />
foretell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to<br />
fall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,<br />
shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of<br />
fighting.&#8221;<br />
So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.</p>
<p>
BOOK XX</p>
<p>THUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son<br />
of Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over<br />
against them armed upon the rise of the plain.<br />
Meanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis<br />
gather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called them<br />
to the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor<br />
a single one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of<br />
rivers and meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of<br />
cloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of<br />
polished marble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for<br />
father Jove.<br />
In such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove.<br />
Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the<br />
goddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in<br />
the midst of them, he asked what Jove&#8217;s purpose might be. &#8220;Why,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods in<br />
council? Are you considering some matter that concerns the Trojans and<br />
Achaeans- for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindled<br />
between them?&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and<br />
wherefore I have called you hither. I take thought for them even in<br />
their destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt.<br />
Olympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans<br />
and Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed.<br />
If Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no<br />
stand against him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and<br />
now that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override<br />
fate itself and storm their city.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took<br />
their several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,<br />
earth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent<br />
in all cunning- all these joined the host that came from the ships;<br />
with them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his<br />
thin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the<br />
Trojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer<br />
goddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.<br />
So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the<br />
Achaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight<br />
was now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for<br />
fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his<br />
armour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians<br />
came to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,<br />
rouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by<br />
the deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all<br />
her might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out<br />
upon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on<br />
the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now<br />
speeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill<br />
Callicolone.<br />
Thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce<br />
contention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered<br />
from heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth,<br />
and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of<br />
many-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the<br />
ships of the Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck<br />
with fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in<br />
terror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground<br />
over his head, and lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of<br />
mortals and immortals- mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods<br />
shudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came<br />
together in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face King<br />
Neptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the<br />
archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister of far-darting<br />
Apollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luck<br />
faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, but<br />
gods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.<br />
The gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the<br />
heart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was<br />
with his blood that he longed above all things else to glut the<br />
stubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack<br />
the son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the<br />
voice of Lycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to<br />
Aeneas, &#8220;Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave<br />
words with which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes,<br />
saying that you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?&#8221;<br />
And Aeneas answered, &#8220;Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son<br />
of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it<br />
would not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right<br />
from Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and<br />
Pedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to<br />
fly, else had the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who<br />
went before him to protect him and urged him to fall upon the<br />
Lelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is<br />
always with him as his guardian angel, and even were it not so, his<br />
weapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him<br />
who is against him; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms<br />
he should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made of<br />
bronze.&#8221;<br />
Then said King Apollo, son to Jove, &#8220;Nay, hero, pray to the<br />
ever-living gods, for men say that you were born of Jove&#8217;s daughter<br />
Venus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is<br />
child to Jove, while Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea.<br />
Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare<br />
you with his taunts and menaces.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his<br />
people, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost<br />
fighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed<br />
Juno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called<br />
the gods about her, and said, &#8220;Look to it, you two, Neptune and<br />
Minerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been<br />
sending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn<br />
him back at once, or shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him<br />
with strength so that his heart fail not, and he may learn that the<br />
chiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have all<br />
along been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come<br />
down from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take<br />
no hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever<br />
fate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and his mother<br />
bore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he<br />
may come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for the<br />
gods are terrible if they are seen face to face.&#8221;<br />
Neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, &#8220;Juno,<br />
restrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing<br />
the other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our<br />
own side; let us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track,<br />
and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus<br />
Apollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot<br />
fight, we too, will at once raise the cry of battle, and in that<br />
case they will soon leave the field and go back vanquished to<br />
Olympus among the other gods.&#8221;<br />
With these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high<br />
earth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the<br />
Trojans and Pallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was<br />
chasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those<br />
that were with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of<br />
darkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow of<br />
Callicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.<br />
Thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side<br />
was willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat<br />
on high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was<br />
alive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The<br />
earth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed<br />
towards each other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them<br />
all, met between the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises,<br />
and noble Achilles.<br />
Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet<br />
tossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his<br />
breast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the<br />
other side sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the<br />
whole country-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill,<br />
but when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches<br />
openmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail<br />
from side to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs<br />
straight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain<br />
among the foremost of his foes- even with such fury did Achilles<br />
burn to spring upon Aeneas.<br />
When they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to<br />
speak. &#8220;Aeneas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;why do you stand thus out before the host<br />
to fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat<br />
of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over<br />
to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or<br />
have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,<br />
fair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This<br />
you shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you<br />
forgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds<br />
helter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to<br />
look behind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the<br />
city, and with the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and<br />
carried its women into captivity, though Jove and the other gods<br />
rescued you. You think they will protect you now, but they will not do<br />
so; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, or<br />
you will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event.&#8221;<br />
Then Aeneas answered, &#8220;Son of Peleus, think not that your words<br />
can scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag<br />
and talk unseemly. We know one another&#8217;s race and parentage as matters<br />
of common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I<br />
yours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your<br />
mother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble<br />
Anchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one or<br />
other of us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly<br />
talk that shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, my<br />
lineage if you will- and it is known to many.<br />
&#8220;In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded<br />
Dardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to<br />
dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained<br />
Ida. Dardanus had a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of<br />
all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the<br />
water-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of<br />
them as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a<br />
dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear<br />
him, and these, as they sped over the rich plain, would go bounding on<br />
over the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or again when they<br />
would disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could<br />
gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of the<br />
Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and<br />
Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried<br />
him off to be Jove&#8217;s cupbearer, for his beauty&#8217;s sake, that he might<br />
dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begat<br />
Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock of Mars.<br />
But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was my<br />
father, while Hector is son to Priam.<br />
&#8220;Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove<br />
gives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let<br />
there be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were<br />
children. We could fling taunts without end at one another; a<br />
hundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run all<br />
whithers and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as a man<br />
says, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard<br />
like women who when they fall foul of one another go out and wrangle<br />
in the streets, one half true and the other lies, as rage inspires<br />
them? No words of yours shall turn me now that I am fain to fight-<br />
therefore let us make trial of one another with our spears.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of<br />
Achilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus<br />
held the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,<br />
for he deemed that Aeneas&#8217;s spear would go through it quite easily,<br />
not reflecting that the god&#8217;s glorious gifts were little likely to<br />
yield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas&#8217;s spear did<br />
not pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,<br />
stayed the point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the<br />
shield in five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and<br />
one of gold; it was in this that the spear was stayed.<br />
Achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at<br />
the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian<br />
ash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was<br />
afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;<br />
the spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the<br />
ground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering<br />
shield. Aeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded<br />
with fear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then<br />
Achilles sprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and with<br />
his keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that<br />
two men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas<br />
wielded it quite easily.<br />
Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards<br />
him, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and<br />
Achilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,<br />
had not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said<br />
forthwith to the immortals, &#8220;Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who<br />
will now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of<br />
Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo.<br />
Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this man<br />
suffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another&#8217;s<br />
quarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the<br />
gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death&#8217;s jaws,<br />
lest the son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated,<br />
moreover, that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom<br />
Jove loved above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not<br />
perish utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the<br />
blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and<br />
his children&#8217;s children that shall be born hereafter.&#8221;<br />
Then answered Juno, &#8220;Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and<br />
consider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer<br />
him, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of<br />
Peleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full<br />
many a time before all the immortals, that never would we shield<br />
Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the<br />
flames that the Achaeans shall kindle.&#8221;<br />
When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle<br />
amid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and<br />
Aeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son<br />
of Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of<br />
Aeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas<br />
on high from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of<br />
many a band of warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god&#8217;s<br />
hand sped him, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the<br />
Cauconians were arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the<br />
earth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged<br />
you on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a<br />
mightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give<br />
way before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the<br />
house of Hades even though fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles<br />
is dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none<br />
other of the Achaeans shall slay you.&#8221;<br />
The god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at<br />
once removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened<br />
them wide indeed and said in great anger, &#8220;Alas! what marvel am I<br />
now beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him<br />
whom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must<br />
be under heaven&#8217;s protection, although I had thought his boasting<br />
was idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me<br />
further, seeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now<br />
give my orders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
He sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did<br />
so. &#8220;Let not the Trojans,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;keep you at arm&#8217;s length,<br />
Achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. However<br />
valiant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of<br />
them. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from<br />
flinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him;<br />
nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand or<br />
foot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly<br />
break their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within<br />
reach of my spear.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans<br />
and declared that he would fight Achilles. &#8220;Be not afraid, proud<br />
Trojans,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods<br />
myself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be more<br />
than a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed<br />
of Achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in<br />
part, and the other part he will clip short. I will go up against<br />
him though his hands be as fire- though his hands be fire and his<br />
strength iron.&#8221;<br />
Thus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the<br />
Achaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into<br />
the midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and<br />
said, &#8220;Hector, on no account must you challenge Achilles to single<br />
combat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the others<br />
and away from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you<br />
with a spear or cut you down at close quarters.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was<br />
afraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then<br />
sprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with<br />
a garment. First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much<br />
people whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities,<br />
in the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles<br />
struck him full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split<br />
it clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles<br />
vaunted over him saying, &#8220;You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero;<br />
your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your<br />
father&#8217;s estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying<br />
waters of Hermus.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The<br />
chariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in<br />
the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a<br />
valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple<br />
through his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the<br />
spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain<br />
inside was shed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended.<br />
Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from<br />
his chariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his<br />
last, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to<br />
offer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the<br />
earth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying.<br />
Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his<br />
father had always forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of<br />
his sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his<br />
folly and showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about<br />
among front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in<br />
the middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him<br />
just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two pieces<br />
of the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced<br />
him through and came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on<br />
to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank<br />
holding his entrails in his hands.<br />
When Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands<br />
and sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he<br />
could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his<br />
spear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When<br />
Achilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, &#8220;This is he<br />
that has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved<br />
comrade. Not for long shall we two quail before one another on the<br />
highways of war.&#8221;<br />
He looked fiercely on Hector and said, &#8220;Draw near, that you may meet<br />
your doom the sooner.&#8221; Hector feared him not and answered, &#8220;Son of<br />
Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a<br />
child; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are<br />
a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue<br />
lies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may<br />
not slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.&#8221;<br />
He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and<br />
though she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going<br />
towards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in<br />
front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,<br />
bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and<br />
hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him<br />
spear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When<br />
he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he<br />
shouted aloud saying, &#8220;Hound, this time too you have escaped death-<br />
but of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom<br />
it seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;<br />
but if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an<br />
end of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,<br />
I will pursue and overtake other Trojans.&#8221;<br />
On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his<br />
neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and<br />
stayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great<br />
stature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him<br />
with his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and<br />
Dardanus, sons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one<br />
with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he cut down in<br />
hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came up<br />
to Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would spare<br />
him and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the<br />
same age. Fool, he might have known that he should not prevail with<br />
him, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in<br />
grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and sought<br />
a hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver,<br />
and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered with<br />
the black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close his<br />
eyes as he lay lifeless.<br />
Achilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a<br />
spear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He<br />
also struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which<br />
became warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes<br />
of Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded<br />
Deucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united,<br />
whereon he waited Achilles&#8217; onset with his arm hanging down and<br />
death staring him in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow<br />
from his sword and flung it helmet and all away from him, and the<br />
marrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went in<br />
pursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertile<br />
Thrace, and struck him through the middle with a spear which fixed<br />
itself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. He<br />
also speared Areithous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning<br />
his horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the<br />
horses were struck with panic.<br />
As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and the<br />
dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of<br />
fire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding<br />
his spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he<br />
would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes<br />
broad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor- and<br />
it is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle- even<br />
so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the<br />
slain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were<br />
bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses&#8217; hoofs, and<br />
from the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to<br />
win still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.</p>
