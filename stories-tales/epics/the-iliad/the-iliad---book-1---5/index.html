				<p>BOOK I </p>
<p>Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought<br />
countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send<br />
hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs<br />
and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the<br />
day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first<br />
fell out with one another.<br />
And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the<br />
son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a<br />
pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of<br />
Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the<br />
ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a<br />
great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo<br />
wreathed with a suppliant&#8217;s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but<br />
most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.<br />
&#8220;Sons of Atreus,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and all other Achaeans, may the gods<br />
who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach<br />
your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for<br />
her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.&#8221;<br />
On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for<br />
respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not<br />
so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away.<br />
&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor<br />
yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall<br />
profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my<br />
house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom<br />
and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the<br />
worse for you.&#8221;<br />
The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went<br />
by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo<br />
whom lovely Leto had borne. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;O god of the<br />
silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos<br />
with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your<br />
temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or<br />
goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon<br />
the Danaans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down<br />
furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver<br />
upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage<br />
that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with<br />
a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot<br />
his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their<br />
hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves,<br />
and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.<br />
For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon<br />
the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,<br />
who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon<br />
them. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I deem that we should now turn roving<br />
home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by<br />
war and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some<br />
reader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why<br />
Phoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we<br />
have broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will<br />
accept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take<br />
away the plague from us.&#8221;<br />
With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest<br />
of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He<br />
it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius,<br />
through the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him.<br />
With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:-<br />
&#8220;Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of<br />
King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that<br />
you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I<br />
shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the<br />
Achaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger<br />
of a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse<br />
revenge till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you<br />
will protect me.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon<br />
you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose<br />
oracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand<br />
upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, not<br />
though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thereon the seer spoke boldly. &#8220;The god,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is angry neither<br />
about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest&#8217;s sake, whom Agamemnon<br />
has dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a<br />
ransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will<br />
yet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this<br />
pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or<br />
ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus<br />
we may perhaps appease him.&#8221;<br />
With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart<br />
was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on<br />
Calchas and said, &#8220;Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth<br />
things concerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was<br />
evil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you<br />
come seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us<br />
because I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of<br />
Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I<br />
love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she<br />
is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.<br />
Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people<br />
live, not die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone<br />
among the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for you<br />
behold, all of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond<br />
all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no<br />
common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities<br />
have been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made<br />
already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove<br />
grants us to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and<br />
fourfold.&#8221;<br />
Then Agamemnon said, &#8220;Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not<br />
thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.<br />
Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and<br />
give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize<br />
in fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or<br />
that of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall<br />
rue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the<br />
present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her<br />
expressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis<br />
also; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,<br />
or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are,<br />
that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the god.&#8221;<br />
Achilles scowled at him and answered, &#8220;You are steeped in<br />
insolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do<br />
your bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not<br />
warring here for any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel<br />
with them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut<br />
down my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them<br />
there is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We have<br />
followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours- to gain<br />
satisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and for<br />
Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for<br />
which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.<br />
Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive<br />
so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better<br />
part of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the<br />
largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can<br />
get and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now,<br />
therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to<br />
return home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured to<br />
gather gold and substance for you.&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Fly if you will, I shall make you no<br />
prayers to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and<br />
above all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so<br />
hateful to me as you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill<br />
affected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that made you<br />
so? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades to lord it over the<br />
Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger; and thus will<br />
I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from me, I shall send<br />
her with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent and<br />
take your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much stronger I am<br />
than you are, and that another may fear to set himself up as equal<br />
or comparable with me.&#8221;<br />
The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy<br />
breast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside,<br />
and kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his<br />
anger. While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty<br />
sword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had<br />
sent her in the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of<br />
Peleus by his yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others<br />
no man could see her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that<br />
flashed from her eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. &#8220;Why are<br />
you here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the<br />
pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall<br />
surely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his life.&#8221;<br />
And Minerva said, &#8220;I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid<br />
you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you<br />
alike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at<br />
him if you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you-<br />
and it shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three<br />
times as splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore,<br />
and obey.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Goddess,&#8221; answered Achilles, &#8220;however angry a man may be, he must<br />
do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear<br />
the prayers of him who has obeyed them.&#8221;<br />
He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it<br />
back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to<br />
Olympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.<br />
But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,<br />
for he was still in a rage. &#8220;Wine-bibber,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;with the face of<br />
a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the<br />
host in fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this<br />
as you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes<br />
from any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you<br />
are king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward<br />
you would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great<br />
oath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor<br />
shoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem upon<br />
the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the<br />
sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees of<br />
heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall<br />
look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day of your<br />
distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,<br />
you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with<br />
rage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the<br />
ground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning<br />
fiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprose<br />
smooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the<br />
words fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two generations of men<br />
born and bred in Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he was<br />
now reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill,<br />
therefore, he addressed them thus:-<br />
&#8220;Of a truth,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean<br />
land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be<br />
glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are<br />
so excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;<br />
therefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of<br />
men even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.<br />
Never again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of<br />
his people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus<br />
son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men<br />
ever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought<br />
the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I<br />
came from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would<br />
have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living<br />
could withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by<br />
them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent<br />
way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl<br />
away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;<br />
and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by<br />
the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You<br />
are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is<br />
stronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,<br />
check your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who<br />
in the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Sir, all that you have said is true, but<br />
this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord<br />
of all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.<br />
Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also<br />
given him the right to speak with railing?&#8221;<br />
Achilles interrupted him. &#8220;I should be a mean coward,&#8221; he cried,<br />
&#8220;were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not<br />
me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying<br />
to your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this<br />
girl, for those that take were those also that gave. But of all else<br />
that is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that<br />
others may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your<br />
blood.&#8221;<br />
When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the<br />
assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back<br />
to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,<br />
while Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of<br />
twenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a<br />
hecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.<br />
These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But<br />
the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they<br />
purified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they<br />
offered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore,<br />
and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up<br />
towards heaven.<br />
Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did<br />
not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty<br />
messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to<br />
the tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and<br />
bring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and<br />
take her- which will press him harder.&#8221;<br />
He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon<br />
they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to<br />
the tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by<br />
his tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them.<br />
They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did<br />
they speak, but he knew them and said, &#8220;Welcome, heralds, messengers<br />
of gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with<br />
Agamemnon who has sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus,<br />
bring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the<br />
blessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon&#8217;s<br />
anger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the people<br />
from ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad<br />
with rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans<br />
may fight by their ships in safety.&#8221;<br />
Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis<br />
from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them<br />
to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then<br />
Achilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and<br />
looking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in<br />
prayer to his immortal mother, &#8220;Mother,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you bore me doomed<br />
to live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from<br />
Olympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so.<br />
Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me<br />
of my prize by force.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was<br />
sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.<br />
Forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down<br />
before him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and<br />
said, &#8220;My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you?<br />
Keep it not from me, but tell me, that we may know it together.&#8221;<br />
Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, &#8220;You know it; why tell you<br />
what you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of<br />
Eetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the<br />
Achaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as<br />
the meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the<br />
ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a<br />
great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo,<br />
wreathed with a suppliant&#8217;s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans,<br />
but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.<br />
&#8220;On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting<br />
the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so<br />
Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So<br />
he went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his<br />
prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the<br />
people died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhither<br />
among the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulness<br />
of his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo, and I was<br />
myself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon the son of<br />
Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since done. The<br />
Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending<br />
gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my<br />
tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.<br />
&#8220;Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and<br />
if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid<br />
of Jove. Ofttimes in my father&#8217;s house have I heard you glory in<br />
that you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin,<br />
when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put<br />
him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to<br />
Olympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men<br />
Aegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he<br />
took his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods<br />
were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all<br />
this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let<br />
the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish<br />
on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their<br />
king, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to<br />
the foremost of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thetis wept and answered, &#8220;My son, woe is me that I should have<br />
borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free<br />
from all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you<br />
should be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:<br />
woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I<br />
will go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove,<br />
if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your<br />
ships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from<br />
fight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the<br />
Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return to<br />
Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with<br />
bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to<br />
persuade him.&#8221;<br />
On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been<br />
taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.<br />
When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid<br />
them in the ship&#8217;s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the<br />
mast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they<br />
would have her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and<br />
made fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed<br />
the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses<br />
led her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her father.<br />
&#8220;Chryses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your<br />
child, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that<br />
we may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the<br />
Argives.&#8221;<br />
So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her<br />
gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the<br />
altar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the<br />
barley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, while Chryses lifted up<br />
his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;O<br />
god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and<br />
rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me aforetime<br />
when I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me<br />
yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the Danaans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done<br />
praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of<br />
the victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the<br />
thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some<br />
pieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on<br />
the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood<br />
near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the<br />
thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut<br />
the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them till<br />
they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished<br />
their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his<br />
full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough<br />
to eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and<br />
handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.<br />
Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,<br />
hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took<br />
pleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on<br />
dark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the<br />
ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they<br />
again set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair<br />
wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft.<br />
As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep<br />
blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.<br />
When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they<br />
drew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong<br />
props beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.<br />
But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not to<br />
the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed at<br />
his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.<br />
Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to<br />
Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the<br />
charge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and<br />
went through great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she<br />
found the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost<br />
ridges. She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seized<br />
his knees, while with her right she caught him under the chin, and<br />
besought him, saying-<br />
&#8220;Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the<br />
immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to<br />
be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking<br />
his prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord<br />
of counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give<br />
my son his due and load him with riches in requital.&#8221;<br />
Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still<br />
kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time.<br />
&#8220;Incline your head,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and promise me surely, or else deny<br />
me- for you have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you<br />
disdain me.&#8221;<br />
At this Jove was much troubled and answered, &#8220;I shall have trouble<br />
if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with<br />
her taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the<br />
other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back<br />
now, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will<br />
bring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.<br />
This is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recall<br />
my word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my<br />
head.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the<br />
ambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.<br />
When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his<br />
house, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged<br />
into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the<br />
coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all<br />
stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But<br />
Juno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman&#8217;s daughter,<br />
silver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began<br />
to upbraid him. &#8220;Trickster,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;which of the gods have you<br />
been taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in<br />
secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help<br />
it, one word of your intentions.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Juno,&#8221; replied the sire of gods and men, &#8220;you must not expect to be<br />
informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it<br />
hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is<br />
no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a<br />
matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Dread son of Saturn,&#8221; answered Juno, &#8220;what are you talking about?<br />
I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in<br />
everything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman&#8217;s<br />
daughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and<br />
had hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore,<br />
that you have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to<br />
kill much people at the ships of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wife,&#8221; said Jove, &#8220;I can do nothing but you suspect me and find<br />
it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you<br />
the more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you<br />
say; I mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid<br />
you for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven<br />
were on your side it would profit you nothing.&#8221;<br />
On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat<br />
down in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout<br />
the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and<br />
pacify his mother Juno. &#8220;It will be intolerable,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you two<br />
fall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of<br />
mortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no<br />
pleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she must<br />
herself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dear<br />
father Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If the<br />
Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do<br />
so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will<br />
then soon be in a good humour with us.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his<br />
mother&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Cheer up, my dear mother,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and make the best<br />
of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a<br />
thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is<br />
no standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you,<br />
he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All<br />
day long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came to<br />
ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life<br />
left in me, till the Sintians came and tended me.&#8221;<br />
Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her<br />
son&#8217;s hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and<br />
served it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the<br />
blessed gods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing<br />
bustling about the heavenly mansion.<br />
Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they<br />
feasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.<br />
Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,<br />
calling and answering one another. But when the sun&#8217;s glorious light<br />
had faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame<br />
Vulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove,<br />
the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always<br />
slept; and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the<br />
golden throne by his side.</p>
<p>
BOOK II</p>
<p>Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept<br />
soundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to<br />
Achilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In<br />
the end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King<br />
Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, &#8220;Lying Dream, go to<br />
the ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to<br />
him word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans<br />
instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer<br />
divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them to her own<br />
mind, and woe betides the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the<br />
ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him<br />
in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head<br />
in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured<br />
above all his councillors, and said:-<br />
&#8220;You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his<br />
host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his<br />
sleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,<br />
though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He<br />
bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take<br />
Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has<br />
brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at<br />
the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does<br />
not escape you.&#8221;<br />
The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were,<br />
surely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was<br />
to take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind<br />
of Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for<br />
Danaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message<br />
still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft<br />
shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his<br />
sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword<br />
about his shoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his<br />
father, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans.<br />
The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might<br />
herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent<br />
the criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them<br />
and the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of<br />
the elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were<br />
assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.<br />
&#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have had a dream from heaven in the dead<br />
of night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor&#8217;s. It<br />
hovered over my head and said, &#8216;You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one<br />
who has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his<br />
shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger<br />
from Jove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and<br />
pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you<br />
shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the<br />
gods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides<br />
the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.&#8217; The dream then<br />
vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the<br />
Achaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and to<br />
this end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others<br />
go about among the host and prevent their doing so.&#8221;<br />
He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all<br />
sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the<br />
Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false,<br />
and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is<br />
the foremost man among us; we must therefore set about getting the<br />
people under arms.&#8221;<br />
With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred<br />
kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the<br />
people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from<br />
some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring<br />
flowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty<br />
multitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range<br />
themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ran<br />
Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus<br />
they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groaned<br />
under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heralds<br />
went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them<br />
listen to the kings, till at last they were got into their several<br />
places and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his<br />
sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of<br />
Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and<br />
guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and<br />
Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left<br />
it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be<br />
borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the<br />
isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives.<br />
&#8220;My friends,&#8221; he said, &#8220;heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven<br />
has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise<br />
that I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has<br />
played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos<br />
with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid<br />
many a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his<br />
power is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an<br />
Achaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against<br />
men fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in<br />
sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn<br />
covenant, and that they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the<br />
roll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; think<br />
further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan<br />
householder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number<br />
that full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer.<br />
But they have in the town allies from other places, and it is these<br />
that hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of<br />
Jove years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their<br />
tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look<br />
anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do has<br />
not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: let us sail<br />
back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.&#8221;<br />
With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of<br />
them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to<br />
and fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south<br />
winds break from heaven&#8217;s clouds to lash them; or as when the west<br />
wind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,<br />
even so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the<br />
ships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. They<br />
cheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the<br />
channels in front of them; they began taking away the stays from<br />
underneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager<br />
were they to return.<br />
Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was<br />
not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, &#8220;Alas, daughter of<br />
aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their<br />
own land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory<br />
of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have<br />
died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,<br />
and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships<br />
into the sea.&#8221;<br />
Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the<br />
topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of<br />
the Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel,<br />
standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he<br />
was grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, &#8220;Ulysses,<br />
noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your<br />
ships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave<br />
Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake<br />
so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go<br />
about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,<br />
that they draw not their ships into the sea.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak<br />
from him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,<br />
who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went<br />
straight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral,<br />
imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of the<br />
Achaeans.<br />
Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him<br />
fairly. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand<br />
to your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not<br />
yet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere<br />
long will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all<br />
of us at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be<br />
angry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the<br />
hand of Jove is with them.&#8221;<br />
But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he<br />
struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Sirrah, hold<br />
your peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward<br />
and no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot<br />
all be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one<br />
man must be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has<br />
given the sceptre of sovereignty over you all.&#8221;<br />
Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people<br />
hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as<br />
the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and<br />
all the sea is in an uproar.<br />
The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several<br />
places, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a<br />
man of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a<br />
railer against all who were in authority, who cared not what he<br />
said, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest<br />
man of all those that came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one<br />
foot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His<br />
head ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it.<br />
Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for it was with them that<br />
he was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice<br />
he began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and<br />
disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at the<br />
son of Atreus.<br />
&#8220;Agamemnon,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what ails you now, and what more do you<br />
want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for<br />
whenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have<br />
yet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his<br />
son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some<br />
young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of<br />
the Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards,<br />
women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at<br />
Troy to stew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we<br />
were of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better man than<br />
he is, and see how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize and<br />
keeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he<br />
did, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him.&#8221;<br />
Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and<br />
rebuked him sternly. &#8220;Check your glib tongue, Thersites,&#8221; said be,<br />
&#8220;and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have<br />
none to back you. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the<br />
sons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them<br />
nor keep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are<br />
going to be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good<br />
success or evil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans<br />
have awarded him so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shall<br />
surely be- that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will<br />
either forfeit my own head and be no more called father of Telemachus,<br />
or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the<br />
assembly till you go blubbering back to the ships.&#8221;<br />
On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till<br />
he dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody weal<br />
on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as<br />
he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet<br />
they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,<br />
&#8220;Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,<br />
but he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this<br />
fellow&#8217;s mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more of<br />
his insolence.&#8221;<br />
Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and<br />
Minerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that<br />
those who were far off might hear him and consider his council. He<br />
therefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-<br />
&#8220;King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all<br />
mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out<br />
from Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of<br />
Troy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set<br />
off homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be<br />
disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even<br />
for a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind<br />
and sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here;<br />
I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we<br />
shall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore,<br />
my friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whether<br />
the prophesyings of Calchas were false or true.<br />
&#8220;All who have not since perished must remember as though it were<br />
yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were<br />
detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on<br />
Priam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain<br />
offering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a<br />
fine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure<br />
water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of<br />
the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from<br />
under the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young<br />
sparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from<br />
under the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them<br />
made nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the old<br />
bird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his<br />
coils about her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then,<br />
when he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent<br />
him made him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned<br />
him into stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to<br />
pass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our<br />
hecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven.<br />
&#8216;Why, Achaeans,&#8217; said he, &#8216;are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us<br />
this sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its<br />
fame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings<br />
and the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight<br />
nine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.&#8217; This was<br />
what he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all<br />
of you, till we take the city of Priam.&#8221;<br />
On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with<br />
the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. &#8220;Shame on<br />
you,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;to stay talking here like children, when you should<br />
fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths<br />
that we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with<br />
our drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we<br />
have put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our<br />
talking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of<br />
Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to<br />
battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme<br />
in vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be<br />
true or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we<br />
should succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and<br />
destruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by<br />
flashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none make<br />
haste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and<br />
avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of<br />
Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at home<br />
again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in<br />
the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel,<br />
for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,<br />
Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and<br />
tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the<br />
Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are<br />
brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other.<br />
Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of<br />
heaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Nestor, you have again outdone the sons<br />
of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and<br />
Apollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the<br />
city of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we<br />
should sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless<br />
wranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl,<br />
in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mind<br />
again, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now,<br />
therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet<br />
well your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; give<br />
good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully over, that<br />
we may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest, not<br />
for a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear your<br />
shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands<br />
shall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your<br />
chariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep<br />
out of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall<br />
be a prey to dogs and vultures.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves<br />
run high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty<br />
headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as<br />
the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans<br />
rise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted<br />
their fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every<br />
man to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that<br />
he might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men,<br />
sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and<br />
invited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor<br />
and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and<br />
sixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own<br />
accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round<br />
the bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,<br />
saying, &#8220;Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and<br />
ridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor<br />
the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates<br />
are consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of<br />
Hector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite<br />
the dust as they fall dying round him.&#8221;<br />
Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.<br />
He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil<br />
continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal<br />
upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed<br />
it. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers<br />
of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they<br />
burned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward<br />
meats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones<br />
were burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest<br />
up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,<br />
and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the<br />
feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so<br />
that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and<br />
drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. &#8220;King Agamemnon,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work<br />
that heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the<br />
people to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among<br />
the host, that we may begin fighting at once.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent<br />
the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called<br />
them, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of<br />
Atreus chose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among<br />
them holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death.<br />
From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly<br />
woven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted<br />
furiously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them<br />
forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that he<br />
might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter<br />
in their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some<br />
great forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is<br />
seen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed<br />
up into the firmament of heaven.<br />
They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the<br />
plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and<br />
thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle<br />
till the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes<br />
pour from ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the<br />
ground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as<br />
thick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.<br />
As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman&#8217;s homestead in<br />
the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so<br />
did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and<br />
destroy them.<br />
The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight<br />
began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks<br />
when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went King<br />
Agamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist<br />
like Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that<br />
lords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the<br />
son of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes.<br />
And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me-<br />
for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all<br />
things, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and<br />
princes of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so<br />
that I could not name every single one of them though I had ten<br />
tongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronze<br />
within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing<br />
Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the<br />
captains of the ships and all the fleet together.<br />
Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were<br />
captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and<br />
rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of<br />
Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They<br />
also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and<br />
Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and<br />
Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus;<br />
Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus<br />
with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea,<br />
sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty<br />
ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the<br />
Boeotians.<br />
Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt<br />
in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble<br />
maiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had<br />
gone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with<br />
her. With these there came thirty ships.<br />
The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty<br />
Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,<br />
rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in<br />
Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,<br />
and Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came<br />
forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which<br />
were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.<br />
Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so<br />
great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a<br />
little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the<br />
spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in<br />
Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and<br />
Thronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships<br />
of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.<br />
The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,<br />
Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched<br />
town of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra;<br />
Elephenor of the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of<br />
Chalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet<br />
of foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who<br />
would ever strive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their<br />
long ashen spears. Of these there came fifty ships.<br />
And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great<br />
Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove&#8217;s daughter,<br />
Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich<br />
sanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with<br />
sacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,<br />
son of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of<br />
chariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was<br />
older. With him there came fifty ships.<br />
Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside<br />
those of the Athenians.<br />
The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,<br />
with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the<br />
vineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came<br />
from Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud<br />
battle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in<br />
command was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed<br />
was chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships.<br />
Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;<br />
Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old;<br />
Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land<br />
round about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of<br />
King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest and<br />
most numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious<br />
in his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for he<br />
was the greatest king, and had most men under him.<br />
And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,<br />
Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,<br />
Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these<br />
were led by Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and<br />
of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others.<br />
Among them went Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to<br />
fight; for he longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had<br />
suffered for the sake of Helen.<br />
The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the<br />
river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,<br />
Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his<br />
minstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus<br />
lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses,<br />
daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him;<br />
whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine<br />
power of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These<br />
were commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came<br />
ninety ships.<br />
And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,<br />
near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men<br />
of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,<br />
and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and<br />
Parrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and<br />
they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each<br />
one of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross<br />
the sea, for they were not a people that occupied their business<br />
upon the waters.<br />
The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is<br />
enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock<br />
Olene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten<br />
ships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus<br />
and Thalpius- the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both<br />
of the race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces,<br />
and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.<br />
And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt<br />
beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and<br />
the son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his<br />
father, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty<br />
ships.<br />
Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with<br />
its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with<br />
the mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led by<br />
Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve<br />
ships.<br />
Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in<br />
Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for<br />
the great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as<br />
was also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians<br />
to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.<br />
The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,<br />
and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and<br />
Lycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus<br />
and Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities<br />
of Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of<br />
murderous Mars. And with these there came eighty ships.<br />
Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of<br />
stature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These<br />
dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus,<br />
Ielysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were<br />
commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had<br />
carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after sacking many<br />
cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, he killed his<br />
father&#8217;s uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in his time,<br />
but was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered a<br />
great following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by the<br />
other sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during which<br />
he suffered great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people<br />
divided into three communities, according to their tribes, and were<br />
dearly loved by Jove, the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the son<br />
of Saturn showered down great riches upon them.<br />
And Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the<br />
handsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the<br />
son of Peleus- but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small<br />
following.<br />
And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the<br />
city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded<br />
by Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of<br />
Hercules. And with them there came thirty ships.<br />
Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and<br />
those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called<br />
Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which<br />
Achilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war,<br />
inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by<br />
his ships, furious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had<br />
taken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked<br />
Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of<br />
king Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving,<br />
but ere long he was again to join them.<br />
And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,<br />
sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea,<br />
and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus<br />
had been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under<br />
the earth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks<br />
in sorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a<br />
Dardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil<br />
of Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were<br />
not without a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled<br />
them; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of<br />
Phylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger,<br />
Protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. So the<br />
people were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they<br />
had lost. With him there came forty ships.<br />
And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,<br />
Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven<br />
ships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to<br />
him, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias.<br />
And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and<br />
rugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and<br />
they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good<br />
archers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of<br />
Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been<br />
bitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and<br />
full soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people, though<br />
they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard son<br />
of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.<br />
Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they<br />
that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were<br />
commanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of<br />
healing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirty<br />
ships.<br />
The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,<br />
with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,<br />
these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there<br />
came forty ships.<br />
Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white<br />
city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son<br />
of Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to<br />
Pirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain<br />
savages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes<br />
was not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of<br />
Mars, who was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there<br />
came forty ships.<br />
Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed<br />
by the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,<br />
and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends<br />
its waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver<br />
eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the<br />
Titaresius is a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.<br />
Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were<br />
they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet<br />
of foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.<br />
Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O<br />
Muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that<br />
followed after the sons of Atreus?<br />
Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.<br />
They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were<br />
of the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,<br />
of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and<br />
terrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much<br />
the foremost so long as Achilles&#8217; anger lasted, for Achilles<br />
excelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles was<br />
now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with<br />
Agamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore,<br />
throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery.<br />
Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild<br />
celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, for<br />
lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host and<br />
went not forth to fight.<br />
Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned<br />
beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land<br />
about Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even<br />
so did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.<br />
And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad<br />
news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,<br />
at Priam&#8217;s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the<br />
voice of Priam&#8217;s son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was<br />
stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes,<br />
to look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke,<br />
saying, &#8220;Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is<br />
at hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host<br />
as is now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as<br />
thick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above<br />
all others, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the<br />
city of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues.<br />
Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, setting<br />
them severally in array and leading them forth to battle.&#8221;<br />
Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once<br />
broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were<br />
opened, and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the<br />
tramp as of a great multitude.<br />
Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the<br />
plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb of<br />
lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.<br />
Priam&#8217;s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the<br />
Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and<br />
most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.<br />
The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to<br />
Anchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the<br />
mountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two<br />
sons of Antenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the<br />
arts of war.<br />
They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of<br />
substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of<br />
Trojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo<br />
had taught to use the bow.<br />
They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,<br />
and the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and<br />
Amphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops<br />
of Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them<br />
not to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured<br />
them to destruction.<br />
They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and<br />
Arisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-<br />
Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of<br />
the breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.<br />
Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in<br />
fertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons<br />
of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.<br />
Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those<br />
that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.<br />
Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the<br />
Ciconian spearsmen.<br />
Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the<br />
broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.<br />
The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from<br />
Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held<br />
Cytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river<br />
Parthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.<br />
Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant<br />
Alybe, where there are mines of silver.<br />
Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in<br />
augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the<br />
hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew<br />
others also of the Trojans.<br />
Phorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far<br />
country of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.<br />
Mesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,<br />
born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt<br />
under Mt. Tmolus.<br />
Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held<br />
Miletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the<br />
river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were<br />
commanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came<br />
into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his<br />
gold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand<br />
of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.<br />
Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the<br />
eddying waters of the Xanthus.</p>
<p>
BOOK III</p>
<p>When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,<br />
the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream<br />
overhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of<br />
Oceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they<br />
wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently,<br />
in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.<br />
As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain<br />
tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man<br />
can see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust<br />
from under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.<br />
When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward as<br />
champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a<br />
panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod<br />
with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet<br />
him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the<br />
ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of<br />
some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs<br />
and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes<br />
caught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be<br />
revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit<br />
of armour.<br />
Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in<br />
fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back<br />
affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a<br />
serpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the<br />
throng of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son<br />
Atreus.<br />
Then Hector upbraided him. &#8220;Paris,&#8221; said he, &#8220;evil-hearted Paris,<br />
fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had<br />
never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to<br />
be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us<br />
and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but<br />
who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get<br />
your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from<br />
your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of<br />
warriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your<br />
whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to<br />
yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner<br />
of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your<br />
lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour,<br />
when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a<br />
weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones<br />
for the wrongs you have done them.&#8221;<br />
And Alexandrus answered, &#8220;Hector, your rebuke is just. You are<br />
hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the<br />
timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of<br />
your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has<br />
given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the<br />
gods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the<br />
asking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the<br />
Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their<br />
midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious<br />
and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear<br />
them to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace<br />
whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go<br />
home to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the<br />
Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and<br />
they all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at<br />
him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying,<br />
&#8220;Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to<br />
speak.&#8221;<br />
They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. &#8220;Hear<br />
from my mouth,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of<br />
Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the<br />
Trojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and<br />
Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let<br />
him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the<br />
woman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let the<br />
rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the<br />
loud battle-cry addressed them. &#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hear me too,<br />
for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of<br />
Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much<br />
have suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did<br />
me. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.<br />
Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and<br />
Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam<br />
come, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are<br />
high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be<br />
transgressed or taken in vain. Young men&#8217;s minds are light as air, but<br />
when an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which<br />
shall be fairest upon both sides.&#8221;<br />
The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they<br />
thought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots<br />
toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it<br />
down upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a<br />
little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to<br />
bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius<br />
to fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had<br />
said.<br />
Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,<br />
wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had<br />
married Laodice, the fairest of Priam&#8217;s daughters. She found her in<br />
her own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which she was<br />
embroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had<br />
made them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said,<br />
&#8220;Come hither, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and<br />
Achaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust<br />
of battle, but now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon<br />
their shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them.<br />
Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are<br />
to the the wife of him who is the victor.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen&#8217;s heart yearned after her former<br />
husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over<br />
her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,<br />
but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,<br />
and Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.<br />
The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were<br />
seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus,<br />
Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to<br />
fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales<br />
that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.<br />
When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to<br />
one another, &#8220;Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure<br />
so much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and<br />
divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her and<br />
go, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us.&#8221;<br />
But Priam bade her draw nigh. &#8220;My child,&#8221; said he, &#8220;take your seat<br />
in front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen<br />
and your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who<br />
are to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible war<br />
with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and<br />
goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so<br />
royal. Surely he must be a king.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; answered Helen, &#8220;father of my husband, dear and reverend in<br />
my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here<br />
with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling<br />
daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be,<br />
and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the<br />
hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a<br />
brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my<br />
abhorred and miserable self.&#8221;<br />
The old man marvelled at him and said, &#8220;Happy son of Atreus, child<br />
of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great<br />
multitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of<br />
Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river<br />
Sangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers<br />
of men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
The old man next looked upon Ulysses; &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who is<br />
that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the<br />
chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks<br />
in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his<br />
ewes.&#8221;<br />
And Helen answered, &#8220;He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of<br />
Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of<br />
stratagems and subtle cunning.&#8221;<br />
On this Antenor said, &#8220;Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once<br />
came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received<br />
them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and<br />
conversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,<br />
Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses<br />
had the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their<br />
message, and the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he<br />
did not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very<br />
clearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two;<br />
Ulysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent<br />
and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor<br />
graceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a<br />
man unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere<br />
churl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came<br />
driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then<br />
there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he<br />
looked like.&#8221;<br />
Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, &#8220;Who is that great and<br />
goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest<br />
of the Argives?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That,&#8221; answered Helen, &#8220;is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,<br />
and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus<br />
looking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him.<br />
Often did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came<br />
visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose<br />
names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find,<br />
Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are<br />
children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have<br />
not left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships,<br />
they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace<br />
that I have brought upon them.&#8221;<br />
She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the<br />
earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.<br />
Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings<br />
through the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth;<br />
and Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to<br />
Priam and said, &#8220;Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and<br />
Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn<br />
covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single<br />
combat, that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor.<br />
We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others<br />
shall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the<br />
land of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the<br />
horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,<br />
gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside<br />
him; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When<br />
they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the<br />
chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between the<br />
hosts.<br />
Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought<br />
on the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they<br />
poured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus<br />
drew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs&#8217;<br />
heads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean<br />
princes, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer.<br />
&#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that rulest in Ida, most glorious in<br />
power, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth<br />
and Rivers, and ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him<br />
that has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, that<br />
they be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and<br />
all her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus<br />
kills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she<br />
has; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be<br />
agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter.<br />
Aid if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen,<br />
then will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and<br />
laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had<br />
reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the<br />
mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying,<br />
Trojans and Achaeans among one another, &#8220;Jove, most great and<br />
glorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them<br />
who shall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children-<br />
may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives<br />
become the slaves of strangers.&#8221;<br />
Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.<br />
Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, &#8220;Hear me, Trojans<br />
and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I<br />
dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and<br />
Menelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall<br />
fall.&#8221;<br />
On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He<br />
gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two<br />
then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and<br />
cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim<br />
first. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed<br />
saying, &#8220;Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,<br />
grant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, and<br />
enter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by<br />
our oaths.&#8221;<br />
Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,<br />
and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several<br />
stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were<br />
lying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly<br />
armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted<br />
with ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his<br />
brother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his<br />
silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his<br />
mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought,<br />
with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he<br />
grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion<br />
Menelaus also put on his armour.<br />
When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode<br />
fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans<br />
were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one<br />
another on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each<br />
furious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the<br />
round shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it,<br />
for the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to<br />
Father Jove as he did so. &#8220;King Jove,&#8221; he said, &#8220;grant me revenge on<br />
Alexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages<br />
yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of<br />
his host.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of<br />
Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt<br />
by his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life.<br />
Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting<br />
part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four<br />
pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, &#8220;Father<br />
Jove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my<br />
revenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled<br />
in vain, and I have not killed him.&#8221;<br />
With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume<br />
of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The<br />
strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and<br />
Menelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had not<br />
Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap of<br />
oxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This he<br />
flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again springing upon<br />
Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched him<br />
up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness,<br />
and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.<br />
Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with<br />
the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman<br />
who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and<br />
of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by<br />
perfumed robe and said, &#8220;Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to<br />
the house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and<br />
dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come<br />
from fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done<br />
dancing and was sitting down.&#8221;<br />
With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she<br />
marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and<br />
sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, &#8220;Goddess, why do you<br />
thus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some<br />
man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has<br />
just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with<br />
him. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus<br />
yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carry<br />
you back to Olympus; worry about him and look after him till he make<br />
you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall<br />
not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among<br />
all the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my mind.&#8221;<br />
Venus was very angry, and said, &#8220;Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if<br />
you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I<br />
have loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and<br />
Achaeans, and you shall come to a bad end.&#8221;<br />
At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and<br />
went in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan<br />
women.<br />
When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set<br />
about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the<br />
laughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facing<br />
Alexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down,<br />
and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband.<br />
&#8220;So you are come from the fight,&#8221; said she; &#8220;would that you had<br />
fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You<br />
used to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than<br />
Menelaus. go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should<br />
advise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him<br />
in single combat, you will soon all by his spear.&#8221;<br />
And Paris answered, &#8220;Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches.<br />
This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;<br />
another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will<br />
stand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never<br />
yet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even<br />
when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-<br />
not even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the<br />
island of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now.&#8221; On this<br />
he led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.<br />
Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus<br />
strode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no<br />
man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they<br />
had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them<br />
hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,<br />
spoke, saying, &#8220;Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The<br />
victory has been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her<br />
wealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony<br />
among them that shall be born hereafter.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.</p>
<p>
BOOK IV</p>
<p>Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor<br />
while Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as<br />
they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon<br />
the town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno,<br />
talking at her so as to provoke her. &#8220;Menelaus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has two<br />
good friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of<br />
Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps<br />
ever by Alexandrus&#8217; side to defend him in any danger; indeed she has<br />
just rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him-<br />
for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we<br />
shall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace<br />
between them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back<br />
Helen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited.&#8221;<br />
Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by<br />
side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,<br />
for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but<br />
Juno could not contain herself. &#8220;Dread son of Saturn,&#8221; said she,<br />
&#8220;what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go<br />
for nothing, and the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my<br />
horses, while getting the people together against Priam and his<br />
children? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of us<br />
approve your counsel.&#8221;<br />
Jove was angry and answered, &#8220;My dear, what harm have Priam and<br />
his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of<br />
Ilius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat<br />
Priam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it<br />
your own way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of<br />
contention between us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart,<br />
if ever I want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you<br />
must not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am<br />
giving in to you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under<br />
the sun and stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected<br />
as Ilius with Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were<br />
never wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, which<br />
is honour due to ourselves.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My own three favourite cities,&#8221; answered Juno, &#8220;are Argos,<br />
Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with<br />
them. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and<br />
tried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much<br />
stronger than I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a<br />
god and of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn&#8217;s eldest daughter,<br />
and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am<br />
your wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then,<br />
of give-and-take between us, and the rest of the gods will follow<br />
our lead. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, and<br />
let her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break their<br />
oaths and set upon the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,<br />
&#8220;Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the<br />
Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted<br />
from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as<br />
some brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a<br />
sign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light<br />
follows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe<br />
as they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, &#8220;Either<br />
we shall again have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of<br />
battle will now make peace between us.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,<br />
son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find<br />
Pandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing<br />
among the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of the<br />
Aesopus, so she went close up to him and said, &#8220;Brave son of Lycaon,<br />
will you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you<br />
will win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from<br />
prince Alexandrus- he would be the first to requite you very<br />
handsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by<br />
an arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, and pray to Lycian<br />
Apollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home to your strong<br />
city of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his<br />
honour.&#8221;<br />
His fool&#8217;s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.<br />
This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as<br />
it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as<br />
the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long,<br />
and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well<br />
down, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow<br />
he laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers held their<br />
shields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he had<br />
shot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out a<br />
winged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of<br />
death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo,<br />
the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong city<br />
of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.<br />
He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew<br />
both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near the<br />
bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and<br />
the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on<br />
over the heads of the throng.<br />
But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove&#8217;s<br />
daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee<br />
and ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a<br />
mother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly;<br />
she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that<br />
passed over his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck<br />
the belt that went tightly round him. It went right through this and<br />
through the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt<br />
beneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows;<br />
it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless the<br />
arrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood<br />
began flowing from the wound.<br />
As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a<br />
piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to<br />
be laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it,<br />
but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver<br />
may be proud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your<br />
legs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.<br />
When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was<br />
afraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs<br />
of the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft<br />
were still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved<br />
a deep sigh as he held Menelaus&#8217;s hand in his own, and his comrades<br />
made moan in concert. &#8220;Dear brother, &#8220;he cried, &#8220;I have been the death<br />
of you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our<br />
champion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded<br />
you; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings<br />
and the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shall<br />
not be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,<br />
he. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their<br />
lives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come when<br />
mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam&#8217;s people, when<br />
the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them with<br />
his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shall<br />
surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now<br />
to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans will<br />
at once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of<br />
still keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here<br />
at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart<br />
Trojan leap upon your tomb and say, &#8216;Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his<br />
vengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his own<br />
land with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.&#8217; Thus will<br />
one of them say, and may the earth then swallow me.&#8221;<br />
But Menelaus reassured him and said, &#8220;Take heart, and do not alarm<br />
the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer<br />
belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and<br />
the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even<br />
so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it<br />
to relieve your pain.&#8221;<br />
He then said to Talthybius, &#8220;Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the<br />
great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.<br />
Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our<br />
dismay, and to his own great glory.&#8221;<br />
Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to<br />
find Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors<br />
who had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and<br />
said, &#8220;Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see<br />
Menelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him<br />
with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed<br />
through the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they<br />
came to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with<br />
the chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the<br />
middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending<br />
its barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid<br />
the burnished belt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of<br />
mail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the<br />
wound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing drugs which<br />
Chiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.<br />
While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward<br />
against them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the<br />
fight.<br />
You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and<br />
unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot<br />
rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of<br />
Ptolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness<br />
against the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving<br />
orders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw<br />
men hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on.<br />
&#8220;Argives,&#8221; said he, &#8220;slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove<br />
will be no helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break<br />
their oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of<br />
vultures; we shall take their city and carry off their wives and<br />
children in our ships.&#8221;<br />
But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined to<br />
fight. &#8220;Argives,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;cowardly miserable creatures, have you no<br />
shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer<br />
scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as<br />
dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reach<br />
the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether<br />
the son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?&#8221;<br />
Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing<br />
through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round<br />
Idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while<br />
Meriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.<br />
Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly. &#8220;Idomeneus,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;I treat you with greater distinction than I do any others of<br />
the Achaeans, whether in war or in other things, or at table. When the<br />
princes are mixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have<br />
each of them a fixed allowance, but your cup is kept always full<br />
like my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,<br />
therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have been always<br />
proud to be.&#8221;<br />
Idomeneus answered, &#8220;I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you<br />
from the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may<br />
join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their<br />
covenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have<br />
been the first to break their oaths and to attack us.&#8221;<br />
The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the<br />
two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a<br />
goat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep<br />
before the west wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty<br />
whirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock<br />
into a cave- even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark<br />
mass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad<br />
was King Agamemnon when he saw them. &#8220;No need,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;to give<br />
orders to such leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own<br />
selves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by<br />
father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are,<br />
for the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we<br />
should sack it.&#8221;<br />
With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker<br />
of the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in<br />
company with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd<br />
of his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in<br />
the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he<br />
could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,<br />
that they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders<br />
to the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,<br />
so as to avoid confusion. &#8220;Let no man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;relying on his<br />
strength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with<br />
the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your<br />
attack; but let each when he meets an enemy&#8217;s chariot throw his<br />
spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of<br />
old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded.&#8221;<br />
Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,<br />
and King Agamemnon was glad. &#8220;I wish,&#8221; he said to him, that your limbs<br />
were as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,<br />
the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it<br />
had fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.&#8221;<br />
And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, &#8220;Son of Atreus, I too<br />
would gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but<br />
the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I was<br />
then young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights and<br />
give them that counsel which old men have a right to give. The<br />
wielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and stronger<br />
than myself.&#8221;<br />
Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,<br />
son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the<br />
Athenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning<br />
Ulysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet<br />
heard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only<br />
just begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for some<br />
other columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the<br />
fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and said, &#8220;Son of<br />
Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand<br />
you here cowering and waiting on others? You two should be of all<br />
men foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you are<br />
ever foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of the<br />
Achaeans are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fill<br />
of roast meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas now<br />
you would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the<br />
enemy in front of you.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses glared at him and answered, &#8220;Son of Atreus, what are you<br />
talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans<br />
are in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do<br />
so, that the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost<br />
of them. You are talking idly.&#8221;<br />
When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at<br />
him and withdrew his words. &#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;noble son of Laertes,<br />
excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders<br />
to give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are of<br />
a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and if<br />
any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.&#8221;<br />
He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son of<br />
Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with<br />
Sthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to<br />
upbraid him. &#8220;Son of Tydeus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why stand you cowering here<br />
upon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever<br />
ahead of his men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least,<br />
say they that saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself.<br />
They say that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae,<br />
not as an enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit<br />
his forces, for they were levying war against the strong city of<br />
Thebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them.<br />
The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jove<br />
dissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus,<br />
therefore, and Polynices went their way. When they had got as far<br />
the deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans<br />
sent Tydeus as their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in<br />
great numbers to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though<br />
he was, he knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among so<br />
many, but challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one of<br />
them was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. The<br />
Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youths<br />
with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon, and<br />
Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in wait for<br />
him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them, save<br />
only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven&#8217;s omens. Such was<br />
Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fight<br />
as his father did.&#8221;<br />
Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;<br />
but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, &#8220;Son of Atreus,<br />
tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast<br />
ourselves as even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated<br />
Thebes, though the wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number,<br />
for we trusted in the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove,<br />
whereas they perished through their own sheer folly; hold not, then,<br />
our fathers in like honour with us.&#8221;<br />
Diomed looked sternly at him and said, &#8220;Hold your peace, my<br />
friend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the<br />
Achaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and<br />
his the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit<br />
ourselves with valour.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so<br />
fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have been<br />
scared to hear it.<br />
As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west<br />
wind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now<br />
comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high<br />
over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions-<br />
even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly<br />
to battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the<br />
men said never a word; no man would think it, for huge as the host<br />
was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, so<br />
silent were they in their obedience; and as they marched the armour<br />
about their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan<br />
ranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be<br />
milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in<br />
answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor<br />
language, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from many<br />
different places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others by<br />
Minerva- and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never<br />
tires, sister and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at first<br />
but low in stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven,<br />
though her feet are still on earth. She it was that went about among<br />
them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand<br />
between them.<br />
When they were got together in one place shield clashed with<br />
shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed<br />
shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great<br />
multitude- death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and<br />
the earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain course<br />
madly down their deep channels till the angry floods meet in some<br />
gorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their roaring from afar-<br />
even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts as they joined in<br />
battle.<br />
First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,<br />
son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the<br />
projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the<br />
point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;<br />
headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he<br />
dropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud<br />
Abantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling<br />
around him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was<br />
not for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in<br />
the side with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side was<br />
left unprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fight<br />
between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew<br />
upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.<br />
Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,<br />
son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois,<br />
as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her<br />
parents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he<br />
did not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off<br />
untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast<br />
by the right nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters;<br />
the spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar<br />
that has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top<br />
is thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots<br />
that he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and<br />
it lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to<br />
earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming<br />
corslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd<br />
and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in<br />
the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other<br />
side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses<br />
was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour<br />
through the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared<br />
round about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did<br />
so. His dart was not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard<br />
son of Priam, who had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge<br />
of his father&#8217;s mares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his<br />
comrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and the bronze point<br />
came through on the other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness<br />
veiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell<br />
heavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in front, then<br />
gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead,<br />
pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from<br />
Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased.<br />
&#8220;Trojans,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves be<br />
thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron that<br />
when hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of<br />
lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the<br />
ships.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while<br />
Jove&#8217;s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host<br />
of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them<br />
slackening.<br />
Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck<br />
by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it<br />
was Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come<br />
from Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the<br />
pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death<br />
throes stretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous,<br />
who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his<br />
belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and<br />
darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia<br />
struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in<br />
his lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of his<br />
chest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the<br />
belly so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his<br />
Thracian comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of<br />
their heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their long<br />
spears for all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back.<br />
Thus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the<br />
one captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many<br />
another fell round them.<br />
And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could<br />
have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva<br />
leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears<br />
and arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched<br />
side by side face downwards upon the earth.</p>
<p>
BOOK V</p>
<p>Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of<br />
Tydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself<br />
with glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet<br />
like the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in<br />
the waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his head<br />
and shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of<br />
the fight.<br />
Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,<br />
priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and<br />
Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came<br />
forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being<br />
on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up<br />
to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over<br />
Diomed&#8217;s left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his<br />
spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the<br />
nipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to<br />
bestride his brother&#8217;s body, but sprang from the chariot and took to<br />
flight, or he would have shared his brother&#8217;s fate; whereon Vulcan<br />
saved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old<br />
father might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of<br />
Tydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them<br />
to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of<br />
Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his<br />
chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, &#8220;Mars,<br />
Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now<br />
leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which of<br />
the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thus<br />
avoid his anger.&#8221;<br />
So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon<br />
the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the<br />
Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First<br />
King Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his<br />
chariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,<br />
just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the<br />
shoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rang<br />
rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.<br />
Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had<br />
come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as<br />
he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded<br />
him as he fell heavily from the car.<br />
The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while<br />
Menelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a<br />
mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had<br />
taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in<br />
mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could<br />
now save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he<br />
was flying; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through<br />
his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round<br />
him.<br />
Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of<br />
Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning<br />
workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that<br />
made the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all<br />
mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus<br />
himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook<br />
him as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point<br />
of the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came<br />
upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.<br />
Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was<br />
a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,<br />
for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up<br />
to him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under<br />
his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell<br />
dead in the dust.<br />
And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble<br />
Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was<br />
honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave<br />
him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon<br />
the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand<br />
fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can<br />
withstand, came over his eyes.<br />
Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of<br />
Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or<br />
the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has<br />
burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful<br />
vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,<br />
but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste<br />
that many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense<br />
phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many<br />
though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.<br />
Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving<br />
the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the<br />
front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right<br />
through the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was<br />
covered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,<br />
&#8220;Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and<br />
he will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me<br />
when I sped from Lycia hither.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew<br />
and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.<br />
&#8220;Dear son of Capaneus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;come down from your chariot, and<br />
draw the arrow out of my shoulder.&#8221;<br />
Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the<br />
wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had<br />
been made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, &#8220;Hear me, daughter<br />
of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well<br />
and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant<br />
me to come within a spear&#8217;s throw of that man and kill him. He has<br />
been too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting<br />
that I shall not see the light of the sun much longer.&#8221;<br />
Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs<br />
supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to<br />
him and said, &#8220;Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for<br />
I have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.<br />
Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods<br />
and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you<br />
battle, do not fight him; but should Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus come,<br />
strike her with your spear and wound her.&#8221;<br />
When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus<br />
again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more<br />
fierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some<br />
mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over<br />
the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has<br />
roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes<br />
shelter under cover of the buildings, while the sheep,<br />
panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of<br />
the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even<br />
thus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.<br />
He killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a<br />
thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with<br />
a sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his<br />
neck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas<br />
and Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never<br />
came back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made<br />
an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two<br />
sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn<br />
out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But<br />
Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,<br />
for he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen<br />
divided his wealth among themselves.<br />
Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as<br />
they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens<br />
on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a<br />
coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from their<br />
chariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave<br />
their horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.<br />
When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went<br />
through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find<br />
Pandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,<br />
&#8220;Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your<br />
renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you nor<br />
is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to<br />
Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully<br />
about, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He has<br />
killed many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who is angry<br />
with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand<br />
against them in his displeasure.&#8221;<br />
And the son of Lycaon answered, &#8220;Aeneas, I take him for none other<br />
than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his<br />
helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if<br />
he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without<br />
heaven&#8217;s help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud<br />
of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have<br />
taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow<br />
went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I<br />
should send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I<br />
have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.<br />
Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father&#8217;s stables<br />
there are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite<br />
new, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a<br />
pair of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me<br />
again and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to<br />
take chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in<br />
battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much<br />
better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which<br />
had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great<br />
gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and<br />
came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it<br />
seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the<br />
sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I<br />
have only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow<br />
down from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in<br />
Hector&#8217;s service, and if ever I get home again to set eyes on my<br />
native place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cut<br />
my head off then and there if I do not break the bow and set it on a<br />
hot fire- such pranks as it plays me.&#8221;<br />
Aeneas answered, &#8220;Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go<br />
against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of<br />
arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can<br />
speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If<br />
Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us<br />
safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins<br />
while I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man&#8217;s<br />
onset while I look after the horses.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Aeneas.&#8221; replied the son of Lycaon, &#8220;take the reins and drive; if<br />
we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better<br />
for their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they<br />
expect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the<br />
fight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the<br />
horses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with<br />
my spear.&#8221;<br />
They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son<br />
of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to<br />
Diomed, &#8220;Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two<br />
heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a<br />
skilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose<br />
sire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let<br />
us retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may<br />
get killed.&#8221;<br />
Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: &#8220;Talk not of flight,<br />
for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither<br />
flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to<br />
mount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me<br />
be afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, their<br />
steeds shall not take both back again. I say further, and lay my<br />
saying to your heart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of<br />
killing both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim<br />
of the chariot; then be sure you spring Aeneas&#8217; horses and drive<br />
them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock<br />
that great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, and<br />
are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole<br />
the blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon&#8217;s knowledge,<br />
and they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he<br />
gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can<br />
take them.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to<br />
them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. &#8220;Great and mighty son,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will<br />
now try with my spear.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck<br />
the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and<br />
passed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon<br />
shouted out and said, &#8220;You are hit clean through the belly; you will<br />
not stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.&#8221;<br />
But Diomed all undismayed made answer, &#8220;You have missed, not hit,<br />
and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you<br />
shall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.&#8221;<br />
With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to<br />
Pandarus&#8217;s nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white<br />
teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue,<br />
coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling<br />
round him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside<br />
for fear, and he was reft of life and strength.<br />
Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,<br />
fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as<br />
a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him<br />
and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should<br />
dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge<br />
and great that as men now are it would take two to lift it;<br />
nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he<br />
struck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is<br />
called the &#8220;cup-bone.&#8221; The stone crushed this joint, and broke both<br />
the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero<br />
fell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on the<br />
ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now<br />
Aeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not his<br />
mother, Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises<br />
when he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two<br />
white arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him by<br />
covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan<br />
should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.<br />
Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the<br />
son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had<br />
given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly,<br />
by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon<br />
Aeneas&#8217;s horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks.<br />
When he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade<br />
Deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the one who was most<br />
like-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He then<br />
remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with all<br />
speed in search of the son of Tydeus.<br />
Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear<br />
in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses<br />
that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster<br />
of cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he<br />
flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate<br />
hand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had<br />
woven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm<br />
of her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the<br />
veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods<br />
do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as<br />
ours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall,<br />
but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of<br />
darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and<br />
kill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, &#8220;Daughter of Jove,<br />
leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling<br />
silly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will make<br />
you shudder at the very name of war.&#8221;<br />
The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as<br />
the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all<br />
besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,<br />
with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon<br />
she fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her<br />
have his horses. &#8220;Dear brother,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;save me, and give me your<br />
horses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly<br />
wounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even<br />
with father Jove.&#8221;<br />
Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She<br />
mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her<br />
and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew<br />
forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where<br />
the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them<br />
from the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus<br />
flung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms<br />
about her and caressed her, saying, &#8220;Which of the heavenly beings<br />
has been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing<br />
something wrong in the face of day?&#8221;<br />
And laughter-loving Venus answered, &#8220;Proud Diomed, the son of<br />
Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I<br />
love best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one<br />
between Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to<br />
fighting with the immortals.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Bear it, my child,&#8221; replied Dione, &#8220;and make the best of it. We<br />
dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,<br />
and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus<br />
and Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that<br />
he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would<br />
have then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of<br />
Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh<br />
worn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when<br />
the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a<br />
three-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also,<br />
did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit<br />
him with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly.<br />
Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and<br />
full of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great<br />
anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the<br />
wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong,<br />
evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell<br />
in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against<br />
yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fights<br />
with gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his<br />
knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus see<br />
that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than you<br />
are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,<br />
rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded<br />
lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with<br />
both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But<br />
Minerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with<br />
their mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221;<br />
said she, &#8220;do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must<br />
have been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the<br />
Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or<br />
other of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin<br />
of the woman&#8217;s brooch.&#8221;<br />
The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his<br />
side. &#8220;My child,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it has not been given you to be a warrior.<br />
Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and<br />
leave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he<br />
knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear<br />
the mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of<br />
his armour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay<br />
him, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he<br />
was coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo<br />
shouted to him with an awful voice and said, &#8220;Take heed, son of<br />
Tydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, for<br />
men that walk the earth cannot hold their own with the immortals.&#8221;<br />
The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the<br />
anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set<br />
him in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the<br />
mighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to<br />
behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the<br />
likeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and<br />
Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one another&#8217;s breasts, hewing<br />
each other&#8217;s round shields and light hide-covered targets. Then<br />
Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, &#8220;Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained<br />
stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,<br />
who would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the<br />
battle? He first went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand<br />
near her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a<br />
god.&#8221;<br />
He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars<br />
went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the<br />
likeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. &#8220;Sons of Priam,&#8221; said<br />
he, &#8220;how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the<br />
Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas<br />
the son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as<br />
Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the<br />
stress of the fight.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then<br />
Sarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. &#8220;Hector,&#8221; said he, &#8220;where is<br />
your prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither people<br />
nor allies you could hold the town alone with your brothers and<br />
brothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as hounds<br />
before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the<br />
battle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the<br />
river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and much<br />
wealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian<br />
soldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though I<br />
have nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on,<br />
without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives.<br />
See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the<br />
meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this<br />
before your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your<br />
allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away their<br />
reproaches from you.&#8221;<br />
So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang<br />
from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among<br />
the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and<br />
raising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again<br />
faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were<br />
not driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some<br />
goodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres<br />
blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff-<br />
heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the<br />
dust which the horses&#8217; hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as<br />
their drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down with<br />
might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them<br />
in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them,<br />
inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas,<br />
Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the<br />
Trojans- for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo<br />
sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with<br />
valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were<br />
overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but<br />
they could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy<br />
with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in<br />
their midst.<br />
The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless<br />
of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds<br />
which the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there<br />
is no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds<br />
whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so<br />
did the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The<br />
son of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. &#8220;My friends,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one<br />
another&#8217;s eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour<br />
more often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life<br />
nor name.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the<br />
front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the<br />
Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever<br />
quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon<br />
struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed<br />
it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly,<br />
and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the<br />
ground.<br />
Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and<br />
Orsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city<br />
of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad<br />
stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat<br />
Orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles,<br />
who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well<br />
skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went to<br />
Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon<br />
sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whom<br />
their dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to<br />
plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed<br />
by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell<br />
like high pine-trees to the ground.<br />
Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the<br />
front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars<br />
egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by<br />
Aeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward,<br />
fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all their<br />
labour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting<br />
their hands and spears against one another eager to do battle,<br />
Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though<br />
he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of<br />
him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of<br />
the Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the hands of<br />
their comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.<br />
They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian<br />
warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on<br />
his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the<br />
son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with<br />
a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell<br />
from his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck<br />
him on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the<br />
chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and<br />
shoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil<br />
till his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as<br />
Antilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.</p>
<p>But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry<br />
rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.<br />
Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil<br />
of battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now<br />
in front of Hector and now behind him.<br />
Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide<br />
plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river<br />
rolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts back<br />
in fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to<br />
his men, &#8220;My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear<br />
so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars<br />
is with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore<br />
towards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not<br />
fight with gods.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,<br />
both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in<br />
war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up<br />
and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of<br />
great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but<br />
his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax<br />
struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly,<br />
and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to<br />
strip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,<br />
many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the<br />
body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him<br />
that he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The<br />
Trojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with<br />
their spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant<br />
though he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.<br />
Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong<br />
hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both<br />
brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and<br />
grandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke<br />
first. &#8220;Sarpedon,&#8221; said he, &#8220;councillor of the Lycians, why should you<br />
come skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you<br />
son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of<br />
old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and<br />
lion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and<br />
though he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the<br />
city of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward,<br />
and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and all<br />
your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will<br />
pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand.&#8221;<br />
And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, &#8220;Tlepolemus, your<br />
father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon&#8217;s folly in refusing<br />
payment to one who had served him well. He would not give your<br />
father the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for<br />
yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to<br />
myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw<br />
at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his<br />
throat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell<br />
upon his eyes. Tlepolemus&#8217;s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh<br />
with such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,<br />
but his father as yet warded off destruction from him.<br />
His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the<br />
weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in<br />
such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of<br />
drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.<br />
Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon<br />
Ulysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld<br />
them. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make<br />
slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however,<br />
that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him<br />
against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor,<br />
Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have<br />
slain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front<br />
of the fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with<br />
terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him,<br />
saying, &#8220;Son of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands of<br />
the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden the<br />
hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of<br />
your city.&#8221;<br />
Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon<br />
the Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore<br />
Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove&#8217;s spreading oak tree. Pelagon,<br />
his friend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon<br />
fainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself<br />
again, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him<br />
new life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had<br />
fallen.<br />
Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by<br />
Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that<br />
Mars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still<br />
turned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be<br />
slain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes<br />
the renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus,<br />
Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who<br />
was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with<br />
the other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile country.<br />
Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said<br />
to Minerva, &#8220;Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the<br />
promise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had<br />
sacked the city of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage<br />
thus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.&#8221;<br />
Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of<br />
great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with<br />
all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on<br />
either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of<br />
gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,<br />
wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round<br />
the axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited<br />
bands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all<br />
round it. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on<br />
to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of<br />
gold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her<br />
steeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.<br />
Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with<br />
her own hands, on to her father&#8217;s threshold, and donned the shirt of<br />
Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis<br />
about. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and<br />
on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;<br />
moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and<br />
awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set<br />
her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in<br />
front and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then<br />
she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout<br />
and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who<br />
have displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of<br />
heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over<br />
which the flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus,<br />
either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it.<br />
Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the<br />
son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus.<br />
There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn,<br />
lord of all. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; said she, &#8220;are you not angry with Mars for<br />
these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he<br />
has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,<br />
while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and<br />
setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope,<br />
Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and<br />
chase him out of the battle.&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more<br />
often than any one else does.&#8221;<br />
Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew<br />
forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can<br />
see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can<br />
the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When<br />
they reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois<br />
and Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the<br />
chariot. She hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia<br />
spring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like<br />
turtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came<br />
to the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered about<br />
mighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and<br />
endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of<br />
brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men<br />
together. &#8220;Argives,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;shame on cowardly creatures, brave in<br />
semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was<br />
so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside the<br />
Dardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight even<br />
at your ships.&#8221;<br />
With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva<br />
sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his<br />
chariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For<br />
the sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield<br />
irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up<br />
the strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the<br />
yoke of his horses and said, &#8220;The son of Tydeus is not such another as<br />
his father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed<br />
madly into the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went<br />
all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I<br />
bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high<br />
spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the<br />
Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so<br />
mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I<br />
bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired<br />
out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that<br />
you are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.&#8221;<br />
Diomed answered, &#8220;I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing<br />
Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of<br />
heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your<br />
own instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods;<br />
but if Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her<br />
with my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other<br />
Argives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it<br />
in the field.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Diomed, son of Tydeus,&#8221; replied Minerva, &#8220;man after my own heart,<br />
fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will<br />
befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close<br />
combat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one<br />
side and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno<br />
and myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans;<br />
nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.&#8221;<br />
With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the<br />
chariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,<br />
whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side<br />
of Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the<br />
awful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins,<br />
and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge<br />
Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars<br />
was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet of<br />
Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he<br />
made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As<br />
soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear<br />
over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed&#8217;s life, but Minerva<br />
caught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the<br />
chariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into<br />
the pit of Mars&#8217;s stomach where his under-girdle went round him. There<br />
Diomed wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his<br />
spear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men<br />
in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with<br />
panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.<br />
As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even<br />
so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.<br />
With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great<br />
pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the<br />
immortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously,<br />
saying, &#8220;Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods<br />
are continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another&#8217;s<br />
hands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having<br />
begotten that mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing<br />
outrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her<br />
you neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the<br />
pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting<br />
proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up<br />
to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he<br />
sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I<br />
must either have lain there for long enough in torments among the<br />
ghastly corpes, or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no<br />
more strength left in me.&#8221;<br />
Jove looked angrily at him and said, &#8220;Do not come whining here,<br />
Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus,<br />
for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the<br />
intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can<br />
do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight:<br />
still, I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my<br />
own off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived you; if,<br />
however, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructive<br />
that by this time you should have been lying lower than the Titans.&#8221;<br />
He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing<br />
herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As<br />
the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment<br />
though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars.<br />
Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took<br />
his seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.<br />
But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a<br />
stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house<br />
of Jove.</p>
