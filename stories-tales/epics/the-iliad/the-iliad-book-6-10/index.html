				<p>BOOK VI </p>
<p>THE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it<br />
would, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain as<br />
they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams<br />
of Simois and Xanthus.<br />
First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke<br />
a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades<br />
by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,<br />
being both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting<br />
peak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead<br />
into the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.<br />
Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived in<br />
the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a<br />
house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit<br />
not one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed<br />
killed both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his<br />
charioteer- so the pair passed beneath the earth.<br />
Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of<br />
Aesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble<br />
Bucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.<br />
While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she<br />
conceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he<br />
stripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed<br />
Astyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell<br />
by the spear of Nestor&#8217;s son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men,<br />
killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river<br />
Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew<br />
Melanthus.<br />
Then Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his<br />
horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the<br />
plain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the<br />
city along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out,<br />
and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot;<br />
Menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by<br />
the knees begging for his life. &#8220;Take me alive,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;son of<br />
Atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and<br />
has much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his<br />
house. From this store he will give you a large ransom should he<br />
hear of my being alive and at the ships of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to a<br />
squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came<br />
running up to him and rebuked him. &#8220;My good Menelaus,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so<br />
well at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of<br />
them- not even the child unborn and in its mother&#8217;s womb; let not a<br />
man of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and<br />
forgotten.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his<br />
words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,<br />
whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then<br />
the son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear<br />
from the body.<br />
Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, &#8220;My friends, Danaan<br />
warriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,<br />
and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can;<br />
the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later<br />
at your leisure.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the<br />
Trojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not<br />
Priam&#8217;s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,<br />
&#8220;Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and<br />
Lycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and<br />
counsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the host to rally<br />
them in front of the gates, or they will fling themselves into the<br />
arms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have<br />
put heart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight<br />
the Danaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to<br />
be done. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our<br />
mother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the<br />
temple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open<br />
the doors of the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva,<br />
let her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one<br />
she sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve<br />
yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of<br />
the goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and<br />
little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on<br />
the goodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men&#8217;s<br />
souls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear<br />
even their great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be,<br />
as we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none<br />
can vie with him in prowess&#8221;<br />
Hector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,<br />
and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,<br />
urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle.<br />
Thereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and<br />
ceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the<br />
immortals had come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so<br />
strangely had they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans,<br />
&#8220;Trojans and allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and<br />
main, while I go to Ilius and tell the old men of our council and<br />
our wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour.&#8221;<br />
With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round<br />
his shield beat against his neck and his ancles.<br />
Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the<br />
open space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they were<br />
close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first to<br />
speak. &#8220;Who, my good sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who are you among men? I have<br />
never seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all<br />
others if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face<br />
my might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come down<br />
from heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son of<br />
Dryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He it<br />
was that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenzied<br />
Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the<br />
ground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus<br />
himself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to<br />
her bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the<br />
man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry with<br />
Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live<br />
much longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore<br />
I will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that<br />
eat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom.&#8221;<br />
And the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of my<br />
lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.<br />
Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring<br />
returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the<br />
generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away.<br />
If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well known<br />
to many. There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of<br />
horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest<br />
of all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus,<br />
who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most<br />
surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and<br />
being stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over<br />
which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted<br />
after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but<br />
Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies<br />
about him to Proteus. &#8216;Proetus,&#8217; said she, &#8216;kill Bellerophon or die,<br />
for he would have had converse with me against my will.&#8217; The king<br />
was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to<br />
Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded<br />
tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He bade<br />
Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end that<br />
he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and the<br />
gods convoyed him safely.<br />
&#8220;When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king<br />
received him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine<br />
heifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon<br />
the tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from<br />
his son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter he<br />
first commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera,<br />
who was not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a<br />
lion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and<br />
she breathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he<br />
was guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed<br />
Solymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles.<br />
Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and<br />
as he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for his<br />
destruction; he picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed<br />
them in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon<br />
killed every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the<br />
valiant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him his<br />
daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom with<br />
himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best in all the<br />
country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.<br />
&#8220;The king&#8217;s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,<br />
Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with<br />
Laodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon<br />
came to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and<br />
dismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and<br />
shunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son<br />
Isander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was killed by<br />
Diana of the golden reins, for she was angered with her; but<br />
Hippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to Troy he urged<br />
me again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie my<br />
peers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers who were the noblest<br />
in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted<br />
his spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. &#8220;Then,&#8221;<br />
he said, you are an old friend of my father&#8217;s house. Great Oeneus once<br />
entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged<br />
presents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a<br />
double cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not<br />
remember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child,<br />
when the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes.<br />
Henceforth, however, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you mine<br />
in Lycia, if I should ever go there; let us avoid one another&#8217;s spears<br />
even during a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and<br />
allies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them<br />
into my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose<br />
lives you may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour,<br />
that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.&#8221;<br />
With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one<br />
another&#8217;s hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made<br />
Glaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for<br />
bronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.<br />
Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives<br />
and daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after<br />
their sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about<br />
praying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.<br />
Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with<br />
colonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all of<br />
hewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,<br />
each with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the<br />
courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for<br />
Priam&#8217;s daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept<br />
with their wives. When Hector got there, his fond mother came up to<br />
him with Laodice the fairest of her daughters. She took his hand<br />
within her own and said, &#8220;My son, why have you left the battle to come<br />
hither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the<br />
city that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove<br />
from the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may make<br />
offering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink and be<br />
refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as<br />
you now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen.&#8221;<br />
And Hector answered, &#8220;Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman<br />
me and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to<br />
Jove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and<br />
filth may not pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and<br />
go with offerings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there,<br />
upon the knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have<br />
in your house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to<br />
sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad,<br />
in the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with<br />
the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus<br />
from off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and<br />
fills men&#8217;s souls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva,<br />
while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would<br />
that the earth might open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred<br />
him to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam&#8217;s sons.<br />
Could I but see him go down into the house of Hades, my heart would<br />
forget its heaviness.&#8221;<br />
His mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who<br />
gathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into<br />
her fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the<br />
work of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon<br />
when he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried off<br />
Helen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was most<br />
beautifully enriched with embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it<br />
glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. With<br />
this she went on her way and many matrons with her.<br />
When they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter<br />
of Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans<br />
had made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands<br />
to the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it<br />
upon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of<br />
great Jove. &#8220;Holy Minerva,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;protectress of our city,<br />
mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the<br />
Scaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that<br />
have never yet known the goad, in your temple, if you will have pity<br />
upon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans.&#8221; Thus<br />
she prayed, but Pallas Minerva granted not her prayer.<br />
While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector<br />
went to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by<br />
the foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house,<br />
storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the<br />
acropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his<br />
hand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to<br />
the shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within<br />
the house, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, and<br />
handling his curved bow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her<br />
women, setting them their several tasks; and as Hector saw him he<br />
rebuked him with words of scorn. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you do ill to<br />
nurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our town;<br />
you would yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the<br />
combat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a blaze.&#8221;<br />
And Alexandrus answered, &#8220;Hector, your rebuke is just; listen<br />
therefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much<br />
through rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to<br />
indulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and<br />
I hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait,<br />
then, while I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall<br />
be sure to overtake you.&#8221;<br />
Hector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. &#8220;Brother,&#8221;<br />
said she, &#8220;to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind<br />
had caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had<br />
borne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that<br />
should have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But, since<br />
the gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been<br />
wife to a better man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men&#8217;s<br />
evil speeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor<br />
never will be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still,<br />
brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the<br />
brunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by<br />
the sin of Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme of<br />
song among those that shall be born hereafter.&#8221;<br />
And Hector answered, &#8220;Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the<br />
goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the<br />
Trojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your<br />
husband, and of his own self also let him make haste to overtake me<br />
before I am out of the city. I must go home to see my household, my<br />
wife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever again<br />
return to them, or whether the gods will cause me to fill by the hands<br />
of the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Then Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not<br />
find Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of her<br />
maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, he<br />
stood on the threshold of the women&#8217;s rooms and said, &#8220;Women, tell me,<br />
and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Was<br />
it to my sisters, or to my brothers&#8217; wives? or is she at the temple of<br />
Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?&#8221;<br />
His good housekeeper answered, &#8220;Hector, since you bid me tell you<br />
truly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers&#8217; wives, nor<br />
yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating<br />
the awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had<br />
heard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans<br />
were in great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the<br />
nurse went with her carrying the child.&#8221;<br />
Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went<br />
down the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone<br />
through the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he<br />
would go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him,<br />
Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the<br />
wooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His<br />
daughter had married Hector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who<br />
carried his little child in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector&#8217;s darling<br />
son, and lovely as a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the<br />
people called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief<br />
guardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did<br />
not speak, and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand<br />
in her own. &#8220;Dear husband,&#8221; said she, &#8220;your valour will bring you to<br />
destruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self who<br />
ere long shall be your widow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in<br />
a body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you,<br />
to lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to comfort me<br />
when you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither father nor<br />
mother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked Thebe the goodly<br />
city of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoil<br />
him; when he had burned him in his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow<br />
over his ashes and the mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing<br />
Jove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers<br />
in my father&#8217;s house, but on the same day they all went within the<br />
house of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and<br />
cattle. My mother- her who had been queen of all the land under Mt.<br />
Placus- he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a great<br />
sum, but the archer- queen Diana took her in the house of your father.<br />
Nay- Hector- you who to me are father, mother, brother, and dear<br />
husband- have mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not your<br />
child fatherless, and your wife a widow; as for the host, place them<br />
near the fig-tree, where the city can be best scaled, and the wall<br />
is weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come thither and<br />
assailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus,<br />
and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or because<br />
some soothsayer had told them.&#8221;<br />
And Hector answered, &#8220;Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but<br />
with what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I<br />
shirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save to<br />
fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alike<br />
for my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely come<br />
when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam&#8217;s people,<br />
but I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,<br />
nor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before<br />
their foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the day<br />
shall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of<br />
your freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you will<br />
have to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to<br />
fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally<br />
by some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,<br />
&#8216;She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans<br />
during the war before Ilius.&#8217; On this your tears will break forth anew<br />
for him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I<br />
lie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear<br />
your cry as they carry you into bondage.&#8221;<br />
He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and<br />
nestled in his nurse&#8217;s bosom, scared at the sight of his father&#8217;s<br />
armour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his<br />
helmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took<br />
the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground.<br />
Then he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his<br />
arms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all the gods.<br />
&#8220;Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;grant that this my child may be even as myself,<br />
chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent in strength,<br />
and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of him as he<br />
comes from battle, &#8216;The son is far better than the father.&#8217; May he<br />
bring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, and<br />
let his mother&#8217;s heart be glad.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who<br />
took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her<br />
husband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed<br />
her fondly, saying, &#8220;My own wife, do not take these things too<br />
bitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time,<br />
but if a man&#8217;s hour is come, be he brave or be he coward, there is<br />
no escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then, within the<br />
house, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your<br />
distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is man&#8217;s matter,<br />
and mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilius.&#8221;<br />
He took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back<br />
again to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards<br />
him. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and<br />
bade them all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own<br />
house though he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should<br />
never see him return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of<br />
the Achaeans.<br />
Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly<br />
armour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as<br />
his feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and<br />
gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to<br />
bathe in the fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and his<br />
mane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies<br />
like the wind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even so<br />
went forth Paris from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his<br />
armour, and he laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way.<br />
Forthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning away<br />
from the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he was<br />
himself the first to speak. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I fear that I have kept<br />
you waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you<br />
bade me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My good brother,&#8221; answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man<br />
with any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you<br />
are careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear<br />
the ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered<br />
much on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right<br />
hereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our<br />
deliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when<br />
we have chased the Achaeans from Troy.&#8221;</p>
<p>
BOOK VII</p>
<p>WITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother<br />
Alexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a<br />
breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have<br />
laboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so<br />
welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.<br />
Thereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he<br />
lived in Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of<br />
Phylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead<br />
with a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.<br />
Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard<br />
hand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he<br />
was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell<br />
to earth from the car, and there was no life left in him.<br />
When, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the<br />
Argives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and<br />
Apollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he<br />
wanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and<br />
King Apollo son of Jove was first to speak. &#8220;What would you have<br />
said he, &#8220;daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent<br />
you hither from Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and<br />
would you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans?<br />
Let me persuade you- for it will be better thus- stay the combat for<br />
to-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass the<br />
doom of Ilius, since you goddesses have made up your minds to<br />
destroy the city.&#8221;<br />
And Minerva answered, &#8220;So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind<br />
that I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me,<br />
then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?&#8221;<br />
Apollo, son of Jove, replied, &#8220;Let us incite great Hector to<br />
challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the<br />
Achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.&#8221;<br />
Minerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of<br />
the gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, &#8220;Hector son of<br />
Priam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then<br />
persuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take<br />
their seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you<br />
in single combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods,<br />
and the hour of your doom is not yet come.&#8221;<br />
Hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the<br />
Trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and<br />
they all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But<br />
Minerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father<br />
Jove&#8217;s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close<br />
ranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when<br />
the rising west wind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark<br />
beneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the<br />
plain. And Hector spoke thus:-<br />
&#8220;Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am<br />
minded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to<br />
nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take<br />
the towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The<br />
princes of the Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him,<br />
then, that will fight me stand forward as your champion against<br />
Hector. Thus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If your<br />
champion slay me, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your<br />
ships, but let him send my body home that the Trojans and their<br />
wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if<br />
Apollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him<br />
of his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it<br />
in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the<br />
Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build him a mound by the<br />
wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails<br />
his ship over the sea, &#8216;This is the monument of one who died long<br />
since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.&#8217; Thus will one say,<br />
and my fame shall not be lost.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline<br />
the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose<br />
and rebuked them, for he was angry. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;vain braggarts,<br />
women forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us<br />
if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every<br />
man of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious<br />
in your places. I will myself go out against this man, but the<br />
upshot of the fight will be from on high in the hands of the<br />
immortal gods.&#8221;<br />
With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your<br />
life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he<br />
was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung<br />
upon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right<br />
hand and said, &#8220;Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be<br />
patient in spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much<br />
stronger than yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many<br />
another as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than<br />
you are, shrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own<br />
people, and the Achaeans will send some other champion to fight<br />
Hector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his knees<br />
will bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from the<br />
hurly-burly of this fight.&#8221;<br />
With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,<br />
whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.<br />
Then Nestor rose and spoke, &#8220;Of a truth,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the Achaean land<br />
is fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and<br />
orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to<br />
question me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How<br />
would it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before<br />
Hector? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul<br />
might leave his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would,<br />
by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and<br />
strong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the<br />
rapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and round about the<br />
waters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood<br />
forward as their champion, with the armour of King Areithous upon<br />
his shoulders- Areithous whom men and women had surnamed &#8216;the<br />
Mace-man,&#8217; because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but broke the<br />
battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus killed him, not<br />
in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his mace<br />
served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and speared<br />
him through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus then<br />
spoiled him of the armour which Mars had given him, and bore it in<br />
battle thenceforward; but when he grew old and stayed at home, he gave<br />
it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same armour<br />
challenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed,<br />
but my high spirit bade me fight him though none other would<br />
venture; I was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought him<br />
Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and strongest man<br />
that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon<br />
the earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I then was, for<br />
the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,<br />
foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any<br />
stomach for fighting Hector.&#8221;<br />
Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started<br />
to their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him<br />
brave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men<br />
clothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and<br />
Meriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon,<br />
Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor<br />
knight of Gerene again spoke, saying: &#8220;Cast lots among you to see<br />
who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will have<br />
done good service alike to his own soul and to the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had<br />
thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people<br />
lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he<br />
looked into the vault of heaven, &#8220;Father Jove, grant that the lot fall<br />
on Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene<br />
himself.&#8221;<br />
As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and<br />
from it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.<br />
The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the<br />
Achaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned it.<br />
When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon<br />
it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and<br />
the herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it and was<br />
glad; he threw it to the ground and said, &#8220;My friends, the lot is<br />
mine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my<br />
armour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves<br />
that the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fear<br />
no man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I<br />
was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.&#8221;<br />
With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus<br />
would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, &#8220;Father<br />
Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory<br />
to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector<br />
also and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and<br />
prowess.<br />
Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming<br />
bronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous<br />
Mars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with<br />
one another- even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring<br />
forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long<br />
spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him,<br />
but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector<br />
beat quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks<br />
behind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his<br />
shield in front of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with seven<br />
folds of oxhide- the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far<br />
the best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven<br />
full-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze.<br />
Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to<br />
Hector, and menaced him saying, &#8220;Hector, you shall now learn, man to<br />
man, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides<br />
lion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at<br />
the ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there<br />
are many of us who are well able to face you; therefore begin the<br />
fight.&#8221;<br />
And Hector answered, &#8220;Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the<br />
host, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot<br />
fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle.<br />
I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for<br />
this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the<br />
chariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the<br />
heart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as you are off<br />
his guard- but I will smite you openly if I can.&#8221;<br />
He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck<br />
the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was<br />
of bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventh<br />
hide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round<br />
shield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his<br />
gleaming shield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning<br />
workmanship; it pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved and<br />
thus saved his life. They then each of them drew out the spear from<br />
his shield, and fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars of<br />
great strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of<br />
Ajax&#8217;s shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart<br />
was turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector;<br />
the spear went through it and staggered him as he was springing<br />
forward to attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring<br />
from the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave<br />
ground, and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that<br />
was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on<br />
the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But<br />
Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and<br />
hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock broke<br />
Hector&#8217;s shield inwards and threw him down on his back with the shield<br />
crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they<br />
would have hacked at one another in close combat with their swords,<br />
had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, one from<br />
the Trojans and the other from the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus<br />
both of them honourable men; these parted them with their staves,<br />
and the good herald Idaeus said, &#8220;My sons, fight no longer, you are<br />
both of you valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; but<br />
night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be well<br />
gainsaid.&#8221;<br />
Ajax son of Telamon answered, &#8220;Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was<br />
he that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will<br />
accept his saying.&#8221;<br />
Then Hector said, &#8220;Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and<br />
strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all<br />
others of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;<br />
hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and give<br />
victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and the<br />
behests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts<br />
of the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those of your own<br />
followers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of King Priam,<br />
bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie with one another<br />
in their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presents<br />
that it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans, &#8216;They fought<br />
with might and main, but were reconciled and parted in friendship.&#8217;<br />
On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and<br />
leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with<br />
purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,<br />
and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their<br />
hero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty<br />
Ajax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been<br />
saved beyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought<br />
Ajax elated with victory to Agamemnon.<br />
When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon<br />
sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son<br />
of Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into<br />
joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting<br />
them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them<br />
off. When they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they<br />
ate it, and every man had his full and equal share, so that all were<br />
satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways<br />
down the loin, as a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had<br />
enough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest<br />
began to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he<br />
addressed them thus:-<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the<br />
Achaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the<br />
Scamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it<br />
will be well when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will<br />
then wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far<br />
from the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our<br />
comrades home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will<br />
build a barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all in<br />
common; near this let us set about building a high wall, to shelter<br />
ourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made gates that there<br />
may be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside we will<br />
dig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, that<br />
the Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the<br />
Trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by<br />
the gates of King Priam&#8217;s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. &#8220;Hear me<br />
he said, &#8220;Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as<br />
I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of<br />
Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn<br />
covenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.&#8221;<br />
He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to<br />
speak. &#8220;Antenor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;your words are not to my liking; you can<br />
find a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have<br />
spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your<br />
reason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that<br />
I will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home<br />
with her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my<br />
own.&#8221;<br />
On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race<br />
of Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity<br />
and goodwill addressed them thus: &#8220;Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and<br />
allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now<br />
as hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.<br />
At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and<br />
Menelaus sons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this<br />
quarrel has come about; and let him also be instant with them that<br />
they now cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight<br />
anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to<br />
the other.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took<br />
supper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the<br />
ships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern<br />
of Agamemnon&#8217;s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. &#8220;Son<br />
of Atreus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the<br />
other noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of<br />
Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you<br />
may find it acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships<br />
to Troy- would that he had sooner perished- he will restore, and<br />
will add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded<br />
wife of Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam<br />
bade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our<br />
dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us<br />
and give victory to one or to the other.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud<br />
war-cry spoke, saying, &#8220;Let there be no taking, neither treasure,<br />
nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans<br />
is at hand.&#8221;<br />
The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed<br />
had spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, &#8220;Idaeus, you<br />
have heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as<br />
concerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are<br />
once dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove<br />
the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,<br />
and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and<br />
Dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he<br />
came, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as<br />
they heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather<br />
the corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part<br />
also hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others<br />
to bring in wood.<br />
The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into<br />
the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when<br />
the two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they<br />
washed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and<br />
lifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to<br />
wail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the<br />
pyre, and having burned them went back to the city of Ilius. The<br />
Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on the<br />
pyre, and having burned them went back to their ships.<br />
Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the<br />
Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was<br />
raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to<br />
shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that<br />
there might be a way through them for their chariots, and close<br />
outside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within<br />
with stakes.<br />
Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove<br />
the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,<br />
lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, &#8220;Father Jove, what mortal in<br />
the whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not<br />
how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a<br />
trench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The The<br />
fame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no<br />
longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built<br />
with so much labour for Laomedon.&#8221;<br />
Jove was displeased and answered, &#8220;What, O shaker of the earth,<br />
are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be<br />
alarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn<br />
itself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships,<br />
you can shatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the<br />
beach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be<br />
utterly effaced.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was<br />
completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their<br />
supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus<br />
the son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted<br />
them with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to<br />
the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the<br />
Achaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some<br />
with hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives.<br />
They spread a goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as<br />
also did the Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the time<br />
Jove boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale<br />
fear got hold upon them, and they spilled the wine from their cups<br />
on to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to<br />
the most mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to<br />
rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>
<p>
BOOK VIII</p>
<p>NOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse<br />
light over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost<br />
crest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave<br />
ear. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as<br />
I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross<br />
me, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an<br />
end. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or<br />
Danaans, he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to<br />
Olympus; or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the<br />
deepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor<br />
bronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that<br />
you may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find<br />
out for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay<br />
hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will,<br />
you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth;<br />
but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and<br />
sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some<br />
pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament.<br />
So far am I above all others either of gods or men.&#8221;<br />
They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had<br />
spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, &#8220;Father, son of<br />
Saturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be<br />
gainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are<br />
perishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so<br />
bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable<br />
suggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in<br />
your displeasure.&#8221;<br />
Jove smiled at her and answered, &#8220;Take heart, my child,<br />
Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.&#8221;<br />
With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and<br />
manes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the<br />
body, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon<br />
he lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt<br />
earth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida,<br />
mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and<br />
fragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,<br />
took them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he<br />
took his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking down<br />
upon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans.<br />
The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and<br />
afterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise<br />
armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but<br />
nevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children.<br />
All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth<br />
with the tramp as of a great multitude.<br />
When they were got together in one place, shield clashed with<br />
shield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty<br />
was the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another-<br />
death- cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth<br />
ran red with blood.<br />
Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their<br />
weapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when the<br />
sun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden<br />
scales, and put two fates of death within them, one for the Trojans<br />
and the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and<br />
when he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught<br />
scale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of<br />
the Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and<br />
sent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this,<br />
pale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid.<br />
Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two<br />
Ajaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene<br />
alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but<br />
one of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had<br />
hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins<br />
to grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in<br />
his anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw<br />
others into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the<br />
traces with his sword, but Hector&#8217;s fleet horses bore down upon him<br />
through the rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself,<br />
and the old man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been<br />
quick to mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.<br />
&#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;noble son of Laertes where are you flying<br />
to, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck<br />
with a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend<br />
Nestor from this man&#8217;s furious onset.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the<br />
Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the<br />
thick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of<br />
Neleus. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;these young warriors are pressing you hard,<br />
your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught,<br />
and your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the<br />
horses of Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thither<br />
over the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the<br />
hero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us<br />
drive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how<br />
furiously I too can wield my spear.&#8221;<br />
Nestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the<br />
doughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor&#8217;s<br />
horses, while the two both mounted Diomed&#8217;s chariot. Nestor took the<br />
reins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up<br />
with Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was<br />
charging full speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his<br />
charioteer and squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast<br />
by the nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he died there<br />
and then, and the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot.<br />
Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let<br />
him lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another<br />
driver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for he<br />
presently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him<br />
get up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.<br />
All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have<br />
been penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men<br />
been quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which<br />
fell just in front of Diomed&#8217;s horses with a flare of burning<br />
brimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath the<br />
car, while the reins dropped from Nestor&#8217;s hands. Then he was afraid<br />
and said to Diomed, &#8220;Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see<br />
you not that the hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes<br />
victory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant<br />
it to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of<br />
Jove, for he is far stronger than any.&#8221;<br />
Diomed answered, &#8220;All that you have said is true; there is a grief<br />
however which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among<br />
the Trojans and say, &#8216;The son of Tydeus fled before me to the<br />
ships.&#8217; This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow<br />
me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Son of Tydeus,&#8221; replied Nestor, &#8220;what mean you? Though Hector say<br />
that you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him,<br />
nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.&#8221;<br />
So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,<br />
and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their<br />
darts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, &#8220;Son of Tydeus,<br />
the Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at<br />
table, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.<br />
Henceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than<br />
a woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our<br />
walls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off<br />
our wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.&#8221;<br />
The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his<br />
horses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice<br />
did Jove thunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that<br />
he would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to<br />
them and said, &#8220;Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close<br />
fighting, be men, my friends, and fight with might and with main; I<br />
see that Jove is minded to vouchsafe victory and great glory to<br />
myself, while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for<br />
having thought of building this weak and worthless wall. It shall<br />
not stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their trench, and<br />
when I am BOOK at their ships forget not to bring me fire that I may<br />
burn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and<br />
bewildered by the smoke.&#8221;<br />
Then he cried to his horses, &#8220;Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon<br />
and goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the<br />
honey-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has<br />
fed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you to drink<br />
whenever you would, before doing so even for me who am her own<br />
husband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor,<br />
the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods<br />
and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomed. the<br />
cuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these two things, the<br />
Achaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she<br />
shook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of<br />
Neptune, &#8220;What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find<br />
no compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you<br />
many a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then.<br />
If all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back<br />
and keep Jove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking<br />
alone on Ida.&#8221;<br />
King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, &#8220;Juno, rash of<br />
tongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not set<br />
ourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,<br />
from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and<br />
warriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that<br />
the hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire to the<br />
ships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of<br />
Agamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this<br />
end he went round the ships and tents carrying a great purple cloak,<br />
and took his stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses&#8217; ship, which<br />
was middlemost of all; it was from this place that his voice would<br />
carry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of<br />
Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- for these two<br />
heroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up<br />
their ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a<br />
voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying,<br />
&#8220;Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;<br />
where are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious- the vaunts<br />
we made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned<br />
cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that you<br />
would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men, and<br />
now you prove no match even for one- for Hector, who will be ere<br />
long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so ruin a<br />
great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when to my<br />
sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars<br />
without offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one<br />
of them, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then<br />
this prayer- suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let<br />
not the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him<br />
that his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,<br />
most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its<br />
talons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the<br />
Achaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the<br />
people saw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely<br />
upon the Trojans and fought more boldly.<br />
There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that<br />
he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight<br />
sooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he<br />
slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon.<br />
He had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the<br />
back midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest,<br />
and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his<br />
chariot.<br />
After him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two<br />
Ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his<br />
companion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus<br />
the brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his<br />
place under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax<br />
lifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one<br />
in the throng, the man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back<br />
to Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck down under his<br />
shield.<br />
Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and<br />
then Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike<br />
Lycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn<br />
did he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw<br />
him making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him<br />
and said, &#8220;Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain<br />
among the host, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and<br />
the glory of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care<br />
of you in his own house when you were a child, bastard though you<br />
were. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I will promise and<br />
I will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me<br />
to sack the city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour<br />
after my own- a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman<br />
who shall go up into your bed.&#8221;<br />
And Teucer answered, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge<br />
me; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never<br />
ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and<br />
kill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been<br />
buried in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was<br />
bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit<br />
Priam&#8217;s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair<br />
Castianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and<br />
now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is<br />
weighed down by showers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his head<br />
beneath the weight of his helmet.<br />
Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again<br />
his arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector&#8217;s<br />
brave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was<br />
driving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he<br />
fell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.<br />
Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for<br />
all his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother<br />
Cebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had<br />
said. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the<br />
ground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent<br />
kill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had<br />
laid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged<br />
stone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder;<br />
he hit him just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest,<br />
a very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his<br />
wrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward<br />
on his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running<br />
towards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield.<br />
Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and<br />
Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain.<br />
glad when he saw<br />
Jove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the<br />
Achaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their<br />
head. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he<br />
gives him chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did<br />
Hector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as<br />
they rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set<br />
stakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands<br />
of the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another<br />
and praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to the<br />
gods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes<br />
glaring like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars.<br />
Juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to<br />
Minerva, &#8220;Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no<br />
more thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever<br />
do so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of<br />
but a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury,<br />
and has already done great mischief.&#8221;<br />
Minerva answered, &#8220;Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own<br />
land, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is mad<br />
with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets<br />
how often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours<br />
Eurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to<br />
heaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the<br />
sense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of<br />
Hades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come<br />
back alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove<br />
hates me, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his<br />
knees and took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do<br />
honour to Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins<br />
calling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go<br />
within the house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we<br />
shall then find out whether Priam&#8217;s son Hector will be glad to meet us<br />
in the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and<br />
vultures with the fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of<br />
the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
Thus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,<br />
obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened<br />
steeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her<br />
richly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the threshold of her<br />
father, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle.<br />
Then she stepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so<br />
stout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the ranks of<br />
heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and the<br />
gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord-<br />
gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven and<br />
Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them or to close<br />
it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.<br />
But father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent<br />
winged Iris with a message to them. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;fleet Iris, turn<br />
them back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to<br />
fighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is<br />
what I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them<br />
from their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all<br />
ten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;<br />
my grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father<br />
means. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she<br />
always contradicts me.&#8221;<br />
With this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights<br />
of Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the<br />
outer gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. &#8220;What,&#8221;<br />
said she, &#8220;are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids<br />
going. This is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will<br />
lame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will<br />
break it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the<br />
wounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn,<br />
grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your father means. He is less<br />
hurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says she always<br />
contradicts him but you, bold bold hussy, will you really dare to<br />
raise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?&#8221;<br />
With this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, &#8220;Of a truth,<br />
child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men&#8217;s battles<br />
further in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have<br />
it, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and<br />
Danaans according to his own pleasure.&#8221;<br />
She turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them<br />
fast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the<br />
end wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon<br />
their golden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they<br />
were very angry.<br />
Presently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered<br />
the assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his<br />
horses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it.<br />
Jove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath<br />
him. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke<br />
nor asked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said,<br />
&#8220;Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing<br />
so many of your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is<br />
the might of my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you<br />
were both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its<br />
terrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been- I<br />
should have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never<br />
have brought you back again to Olympus.&#8221;<br />
Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and<br />
brooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word,<br />
for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her<br />
father; but Juno could not contain herself and said, &#8220;What, dread<br />
son of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,<br />
nevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are<br />
perishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so<br />
bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable<br />
suggestions to the Argives, that they may not all of them perish in<br />
your displeasure.&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,<br />
you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the<br />
Argives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused<br />
the son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their<br />
ships&#8217; sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is<br />
how it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths<br />
beneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus<br />
with neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go<br />
on and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your<br />
displeasure; you are the greatest vixen living.&#8221;<br />
Juno made him no answer. The sun&#8217;s glorious orb now sank into<br />
Oceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the<br />
Trojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for<br />
did darkness fall upon the Achaeans.<br />
Then Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a<br />
council on the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear<br />
corpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear<br />
the speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the<br />
bronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the<br />
spear-head was of gold Spear in hand he spoke. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should<br />
destroy the ships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to<br />
Ilius, but darkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved<br />
them and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey<br />
the behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of<br />
their chariots and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to<br />
bring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for<br />
your horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn<br />
watchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try<br />
to fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless<br />
and unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart with him to<br />
nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his<br />
ship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon the<br />
Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that the<br />
growing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon its<br />
heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great fire in<br />
her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by<br />
surprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as I<br />
have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I will<br />
instruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the gods that we<br />
may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for &#8217;tis the<br />
fates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,<br />
therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on our<br />
armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then<br />
know whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from<br />
the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry<br />
off his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle,<br />
abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be<br />
among the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.<br />
Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, and<br />
of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day<br />
will bring evil to the Argives.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took<br />
their sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each<br />
by his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the<br />
city, they brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered<br />
much wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals,<br />
and the wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but<br />
the blessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius<br />
with Priam and Priam&#8217;s people. Thus high in hope they sat through<br />
the livelong night by the highways of war, and many a watchfire did<br />
they kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright-<br />
there is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting<br />
headland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks<br />
from the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and the<br />
heart of the shepherd is glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the<br />
Trojans before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A<br />
thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each<br />
there sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn beside<br />
their chariots, waited till dawn should come.</p>
<p>
BOOK IX</p>
<p>THUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained<br />
Rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all<br />
of them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the<br />
north and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of<br />
the main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter<br />
their sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were the<br />
hearts of the Achaeans.<br />
The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a<br />
council man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste<br />
also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their<br />
assembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract<br />
on the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he<br />
spoke to the Achaeans. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;princes and councillors<br />
Of the Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.<br />
Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of<br />
Troy before returning, but he has played me false, and is now<br />
bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people.<br />
Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust<br />
as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore,<br />
let us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we<br />
shall not take Troy.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat<br />
sorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of<br />
the loud battle-cry made answer saying, &#8220;Son of Atreus, I will chide<br />
your folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I<br />
should do so. In the first place you attacked me before all the<br />
Danaans and said that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young<br />
and old know that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed<br />
you by halves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but<br />
valour, which is the highest both right and might he did not give you.<br />
Sir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike<br />
and cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going<br />
home- go- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you<br />
from Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay<br />
here till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn<br />
homeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on<br />
till we reach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we<br />
came.&#8221;<br />
The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,<br />
and presently Nestor rose to speak. &#8220;Son of Tydeus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;in<br />
war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all<br />
who are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of<br />
what you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of<br />
the whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest of my<br />
own children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled the<br />
chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am<br />
older than you and I will tell you every&#8221; thing; therefore let no man,<br />
not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments<br />
civil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.<br />
&#8220;Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,<br />
but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is<br />
without the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;<br />
when they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your<br />
orders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for<br />
your councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;<br />
there is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the<br />
Achaeans bring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal<br />
wherewith to entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many<br />
are got together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest-<br />
and sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has<br />
lit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than<br />
dismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels<br />
went out in their armour under command of Nestor&#8217;s son Thrasymedes,<br />
a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and<br />
Ialmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son<br />
of Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the<br />
sentinels, and with each there went a hundred youths armed with long<br />
spears: they took their places midway between the trench and the wall,<br />
and when they had done so they lit their fires and got every man his<br />
supper.<br />
The son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to<br />
his quarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their<br />
hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they<br />
had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever<br />
truest, was the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with<br />
all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.<br />
&#8220;With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,<br />
will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much<br />
people. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to<br />
uphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your people<br />
under you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak<br />
and to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have been<br />
minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,<br />
therefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of a<br />
truer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,<br />
sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against<br />
my judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own<br />
pride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for you<br />
still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let<br />
us think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair<br />
speeches that may conciliate him.&#8221;<br />
And King Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Sir, you have reproved my folly<br />
justly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself<br />
a host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying<br />
much people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to<br />
my worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him<br />
great gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of<br />
you all. I will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the<br />
fire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons<br />
and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes.<br />
Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as<br />
my horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen,<br />
Lesbians, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of<br />
surpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I<br />
erewhile took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great<br />
oath that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after<br />
the manner of men and women.<br />
&#8220;All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the<br />
gods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we<br />
Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and<br />
bronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women,<br />
the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean<br />
Argos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will<br />
show him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who is being<br />
nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, Chrysothemis,<br />
Laodice, and lphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, freely<br />
and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add such<br />
dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give<br />
him seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where<br />
there is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea<br />
also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on<br />
the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in<br />
cattle and sheep; they will honour him with gifts as though he were<br />
a god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances. All this will<br />
I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him then yieldit is only<br />
Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding- and hence he is of all<br />
gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and more<br />
royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me.&#8221;<br />
Then Nestor answered, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,<br />
Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send<br />
chosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus<br />
without delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to<br />
Jove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds<br />
Odius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, and<br />
bid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be<br />
that he may have mercy upon us.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants<br />
poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the<br />
mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving<br />
every man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their<br />
offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set<br />
out from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking<br />
first to one and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses,<br />
was instant with them that they should prevail with the noble son of<br />
Peleus.<br />
They went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed<br />
earnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the<br />
son of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reached<br />
the ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a<br />
lyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver.<br />
It was part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city<br />
of Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the<br />
feats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to<br />
him and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses<br />
and Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.<br />
Achilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and<br />
Patroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted<br />
them saying, &#8220;All hail and welcome- you must come upon some great<br />
matter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered<br />
with purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, &#8220;Son<br />
of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with<br />
the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends,<br />
who are now under my roof.&#8221;<br />
Patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block<br />
in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the<br />
loin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the<br />
meat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them<br />
on spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When<br />
the flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top<br />
of them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and<br />
he sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it on<br />
platters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, while<br />
Achilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing<br />
Ulysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus<br />
offer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,<br />
and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before<br />
them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a<br />
sign to Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with<br />
wine and pledged Achilles.<br />
&#8220;Hail,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,<br />
neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been<br />
plenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter.<br />
Sir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without your help<br />
know not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and<br />
their allies have camped hard by our ships and by the wall; they<br />
have lit watchfires throughout their host and deem that nothing can<br />
now prevent them from falling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent<br />
his lightnings on their right; Hector, in all his glory, rages like<br />
a maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears neither god nor<br />
man, but is gone raving mad, and prays for the approach of day. He<br />
vows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire<br />
to their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed<br />
and smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good his<br />
boasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our<br />
home in Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of the<br />
Achaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repent<br />
bitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is done there will<br />
be no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaans<br />
from destruction.<br />
&#8220;My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to<br />
Agamemnon, did he not charge you saying, &#8216;Son, Minerva and Juno will<br />
make you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the<br />
better part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the<br />
Achaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.&#8217; These were<br />
his words, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be<br />
appeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you<br />
great amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what<br />
he has said in his tent that he will give you. He will give you<br />
seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of<br />
gold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won<br />
races and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is<br />
he who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon.<br />
Moreover he will give you seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he<br />
chose for himself, when you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.<br />
He will give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from<br />
you, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has<br />
never gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of men<br />
and women. All these things will he give you now down, and if<br />
hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can<br />
come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your ship<br />
with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty Trojan women,<br />
the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean<br />
Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he<br />
will show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who is<br />
being nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters,<br />
Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one of your<br />
choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; he<br />
will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter,<br />
and will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and<br />
Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea;<br />
Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and<br />
on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in<br />
cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were a<br />
god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this will<br />
he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate both<br />
him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of the<br />
Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour<br />
you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You<br />
might even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he is<br />
infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought<br />
can hold his own against him.&#8221;<br />
Achilles answered, &#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you<br />
formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no<br />
more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do I<br />
hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides<br />
another in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be<br />
appeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the<br />
Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He<br />
that fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are<br />
held in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works<br />
and him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with my<br />
life ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it<br />
to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long night<br />
have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day<br />
against those who were fighting for their women. With my ships I<br />
have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed<br />
with my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of<br />
them, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where he<br />
was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept<br />
much himself.<br />
&#8220;Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the<br />
chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of<br />
the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep<br />
her and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the<br />
Trojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?<br />
Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only<br />
men in the world who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling<br />
will love and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my<br />
whole heart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has<br />
taken her from me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt<br />
me no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses,<br />
and to the other princes to save his ships from burning. He has done<br />
much without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep<br />
and wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but<br />
even so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I<br />
fought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from<br />
the city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree,<br />
but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape<br />
my onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will<br />
to-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw<br />
my ships into the water and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning,<br />
if you care to look, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my<br />
men rowing out to sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes<br />
me a fair passage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much<br />
there that I left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall<br />
bring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair<br />
women, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one<br />
prize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now<br />
bid you, and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and<br />
beware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his<br />
effrontery never fails him.<br />
&#8220;As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I<br />
will take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common<br />
with him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen<br />
me further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his<br />
reason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.<br />
He may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-<br />
not though it be all that he has in the world, both now or ever<br />
shall have; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of<br />
Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world, for<br />
it has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may drive<br />
at once with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the<br />
sands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he<br />
shall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter<br />
wrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair<br />
as Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let<br />
another take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules a<br />
larger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will<br />
find me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia,<br />
daughters of kings that have cities under them; of these I can take<br />
whom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in<br />
Phthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, and<br />
to enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to me<br />
than all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before the<br />
Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the stone<br />
floor of Apollo&#8217;s temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep<br />
are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses if<br />
he wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither be<br />
bought nor harried back again.<br />
&#8220;My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may<br />
meet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but my<br />
name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but it<br />
will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say,<br />
&#8216;Go home, for you will not take Ilius.&#8217; Jove has held his hand over<br />
her to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, as<br />
in duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that I<br />
have sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of<br />
their ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one<br />
that they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him<br />
sleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.<br />
But I will not take him by force.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he<br />
had denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great<br />
fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said,<br />
&#8220;Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the<br />
fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships from<br />
burning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your father<br />
Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad from<br />
Phthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts<br />
whereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me with you to<br />
train you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my son, I<br />
will not stay here without you- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe<br />
to strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I first<br />
left Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger of<br />
father Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was furious with me in the<br />
matter of his concubine, of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of<br />
his wife my mother. My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to<br />
lie with the woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in the<br />
course of time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, and<br />
cursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayed<br />
that no son of mine might ever sit upon knees- and the gods, Jove of<br />
the world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I took<br />
counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me think<br />
on men&#8217;s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer of<br />
my father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father&#8217;s<br />
house with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen came<br />
about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a sheep and many an ox<br />
did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roast<br />
before the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father&#8217;s wine.<br />
Nine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking it in turns to<br />
watch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the cloister of<br />
the outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the room<br />
wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, I<br />
broke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the<br />
outer court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men on<br />
guard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came<br />
to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me<br />
welcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir<br />
to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,<br />
establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler<br />
over the Dolopians.<br />
&#8220;It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all<br />
my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone<br />
out elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the<br />
dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your<br />
lips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness<br />
over my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven<br />
had vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,<br />
Achilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now,<br />
therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish not<br />
your anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are more than<br />
ours, but even heaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he<br />
prays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries<br />
and by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burnt<br />
sacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled,<br />
with eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being<br />
fierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful<br />
to mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but<br />
nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a man has<br />
pity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near him, they will<br />
bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them and<br />
will not listen to them, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray<br />
that he may presently fall into sin- to his ruing bitterly<br />
hereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove due<br />
reverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were not<br />
the son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later- if he<br />
were still furious and implacable- I am not he that would bid you<br />
throw off your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how great<br />
their need; but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has sent<br />
his captains to urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all the<br />
Argives are most acceptable to you; make not then their words and<br />
their coming to be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous so<br />
far. We have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they<br />
were roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fair<br />
words could soothe them.<br />
&#8220;I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all<br />
friends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were<br />
fighting and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetolians<br />
defending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana<br />
of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had<br />
not offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had all<br />
been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove alone<br />
he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other it<br />
had escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer<br />
goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him- a<br />
savage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to his<br />
orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them<br />
to the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from<br />
many cities and killed it- for it was so monstrous that not a few were<br />
needed, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this<br />
the goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about<br />
the head and skin of the boar.<br />
&#8220;So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the<br />
Curetes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their ground<br />
under the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered<br />
as even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his<br />
mother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair<br />
Cleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of<br />
Ides the man then living. He it was who took his bow and faced King<br />
Apollo himself for fair Marpessa&#8217;s sake; her father and mother then<br />
named her Alcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintive<br />
strains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off.<br />
Meleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which<br />
he felt by reason of his mother&#8217;s curses. His mother, grieving for the<br />
death of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her<br />
hands, calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down<br />
upon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that<br />
they would kill her son- and Erinys that walks in darkness and knows<br />
no ruth heard her from Erebus.<br />
&#8220;Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and<br />
the dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the<br />
elders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of<br />
their priests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him<br />
a great reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most<br />
fertile in the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other<br />
open plough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the<br />
threshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His<br />
sisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more<br />
refused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to<br />
him also prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was<br />
battering at the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled<br />
the walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his<br />
sorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is<br />
taken; she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given<br />
over to the flames, while the women and children are carried into<br />
captivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he<br />
donned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion he<br />
saved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of<br />
those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he<br />
saved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thus<br />
minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the ships<br />
are burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts,<br />
and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas if you<br />
fight without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but you<br />
will not be held in like honour.&#8221;<br />
And Achilles answered, &#8220;Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no<br />
need of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide<br />
with me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are<br />
strong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no more<br />
with this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son of<br />
Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. You<br />
ought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king as<br />
much as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others shall take<br />
my answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at<br />
daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go.&#8221;<br />
On this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to<br />
prepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their<br />
leave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, &#8220;Ulysses, noble son of<br />
Laertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must<br />
now take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are<br />
waiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is<br />
cruel, and cares nothing for the love his comrades lavished upon him<br />
more than on all the others. He is implacable- and yet if a man&#8217;s<br />
brother or son has been slain he will accept a fine by way of amends<br />
from him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid in full<br />
remains in peace among his own people; but as for you, Achilles, the<br />
gods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, all<br />
about one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we<br />
have, and much else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind,<br />
respect the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as<br />
messengers from the host of the Danaans, and would fain he held<br />
nearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ajax,&#8221; replied Achilles, &#8220;noble son of Telamon, you have spoken<br />
much to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and<br />
remember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I<br />
were some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go,<br />
then, and deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with<br />
fighting till Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the<br />
Myrmidons in his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships.<br />
For all his lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he<br />
is at my own tent and ship.&#8221;<br />
On this they took every man his double cup, made their<br />
drink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the<br />
way. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make ready<br />
a comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so with<br />
sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laid<br />
himself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles slept in an<br />
inner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede,<br />
whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side<br />
of the room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given him<br />
when he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.<br />
When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans<br />
rose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King<br />
Agamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will he<br />
save the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still<br />
furious?&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,<br />
Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, and<br />
spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with the<br />
Achaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,<br />
he said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. He<br />
said further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,<br />
for that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. &#8216;Jove,&#8217; he said, &#8216;has<br />
laid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken<br />
heart.&#8217; This is what he said, and the others who were with me can tell<br />
you the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who<br />
may be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,<br />
for so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the<br />
morning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and<br />
dejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused<br />
them, till presently Diomed said, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, king of<br />
men, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor<br />
offered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you have<br />
encouraged him in his pride am further. Let him stay or go as he will.<br />
He will fight later when he is in the humour, and heaven puts it in<br />
his mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; we have<br />
eaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in rest there<br />
is both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears,<br />
forthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the ships,<br />
urging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.&#8221;<br />
Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They<br />
then made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent,<br />
where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>
<p>
BOOK X</p>
<p>NOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole<br />
night through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he<br />
could get no rest. As when fair Juno&#8217;s lord flashes his lightning in<br />
token of great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the<br />
ground, or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry<br />
war, even so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul<br />
trembled within him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he<br />
marvelled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the<br />
sound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he<br />
turned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair<br />
by handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very<br />
disquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once<br />
to Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any<br />
way of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his<br />
shirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a<br />
huge tawny lion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet-<br />
and took his spear in his hand.<br />
Neither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives<br />
who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the<br />
Trojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,<br />
put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny<br />
hand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most<br />
powerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though<br />
he were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting<br />
his goodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his<br />
brother had come.<br />
Menelaus spoke first. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my dear brother, are you thus<br />
arming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the<br />
Trojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and<br />
spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of<br />
great daring.&#8221;<br />
And King Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd<br />
counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his<br />
mind, and inclines towards Hector&#8217;s sacrifices rather than ours. I<br />
never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one<br />
day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans- and<br />
that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor<br />
goddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with<br />
all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.<br />
Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the<br />
companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they<br />
will listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and<br />
Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It<br />
was to them more particularly that we gave this charge.&#8221;<br />
Menelaus replied, &#8220;How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with<br />
them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have<br />
given your orders?&#8221; &#8220;Wait,&#8221; answered King Agamemnon, &#8220;for there are so<br />
many paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every<br />
man on your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage<br />
and by his father&#8217;s name, give each all titular observance, and<br />
stand not too much upon your own dignity; we must take our full<br />
share of toil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.&#8221;<br />
With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went<br />
on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent<br />
hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,<br />
his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle<br />
with which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people<br />
into battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his<br />
elbow and looked up at Agamemnon. &#8220;Who is it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that goes<br />
thus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when<br />
men are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some<br />
comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your<br />
business?&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the<br />
Achaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has<br />
laid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my<br />
limbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my<br />
eyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the<br />
Achaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without<br />
sure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap out of my body,<br />
and my limbs fail me. If then you can do anything- for you too<br />
cannot sleep- let us go the round of the watch, and see whether they<br />
are drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The<br />
enemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by night.&#8221;<br />
Nestor replied, &#8220;Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,<br />
Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will<br />
have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I<br />
will go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of<br />
Tydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some<br />
one had also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their<br />
ships are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however<br />
refrain from blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- and<br />
I will say so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleeping<br />
and leaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about<br />
imploring aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in<br />
extreme danger.&#8221;<br />
And Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,<br />
for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed from<br />
sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me<br />
to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I<br />
was, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call<br />
the very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall<br />
find them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said<br />
that we would meet them.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In that case,&#8221; answered Nestor, &#8220;the Argives will not blame him nor<br />
disobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them<br />
instructions.&#8221;<br />
With this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his<br />
comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large,<br />
and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod<br />
spear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First<br />
he called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him,<br />
for he was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside<br />
his tent and said, &#8220;Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along<br />
the line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that<br />
you find so urgent?&#8221; And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, &#8220;Ulysses,<br />
noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great<br />
straits. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may advise<br />
well with us whether we shall fight or fly.&#8221;<br />
On this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his<br />
shoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of<br />
Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his<br />
comrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for<br />
their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that<br />
were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar<br />
like the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin<br />
of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up<br />
to him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him<br />
and urging him to bestir himself. &#8220;Wake up,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;son of<br />
Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that the<br />
Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,<br />
with but a little space between us and them?&#8221;<br />
On these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, &#8220;Old man, your<br />
heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there<br />
no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the<br />
princes? There is no tiring you.&#8221;<br />
And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, &#8220;My son, all that you<br />
have said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might<br />
call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger;<br />
life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go<br />
then, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax<br />
and the fleet son of Phyleus.&#8221;<br />
Diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- a<br />
skin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had<br />
roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the<br />
round of those who were on guard, and found the captains not<br />
sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms<br />
about them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are<br />
yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain forest<br />
towards them- forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and<br />
slumber is broken- even so was sleep chased from the eyes of the<br />
Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned<br />
constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among the<br />
Trojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. &#8220;Watch on,<br />
my children,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest<br />
our enemies triumph over us.&#8221;<br />
With this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the<br />
Achaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave<br />
son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were<br />
beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their<br />
meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses,<br />
for it was here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his<br />
onslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate<br />
with one another.<br />
Nestor spoke first. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is there any man bold<br />
enough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us<br />
news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the<br />
ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the<br />
Achaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn all<br />
this and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in<br />
the mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs<br />
from all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her<br />
lamb- which is a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked as<br />
a guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke<br />
saying, &#8220;Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over<br />
against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater<br />
confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see<br />
some opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man<br />
is alone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.&#8221;<br />
On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,<br />
servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so<br />
did Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host<br />
of the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon<br />
Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: &#8220;Diomed,&#8221; said he, &#8220;son of Tydeus,<br />
man after my own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take the<br />
best man of those that have offered, for many would now go with you.<br />
Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst<br />
out of respect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood.&#8221;<br />
He said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, &#8220;If<br />
you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I<br />
fail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face<br />
all kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were<br />
to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is<br />
quick to see and understand.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Son of Tydeus,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;say neither good nor ill about<br />
me, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for<br />
the night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,<br />
two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left<br />
us.&#8221;<br />
They then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of<br />
Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)<br />
and on his head he set a helmet of bull&#8217;s hide without either peak<br />
or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.<br />
Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set<br />
a leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern<br />
thongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar&#8217;s teeth,<br />
well and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner<br />
lining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of<br />
Eleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He<br />
gave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas<br />
gave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and<br />
now it was set upon the head of Ulysses.<br />
When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains<br />
behind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon<br />
their right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they<br />
heard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to<br />
Minerva: &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who<br />
spy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships;<br />
befriend me in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to the<br />
ships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploit<br />
that shall bring sorrow to the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
Then Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: &#8220;Hear me too,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my<br />
noble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the<br />
Achaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus,<br />
and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on<br />
his return thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of<br />
daring, for you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me<br />
now, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer<br />
of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the<br />
yoke. I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you in<br />
sacrifice.&#8221;<br />
Thus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they<br />
had done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way<br />
like two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained<br />
bodies of them that had fallen.<br />
Neither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called<br />
the princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his<br />
counsel before them. &#8220;Is there one,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who for a great<br />
reward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be<br />
well paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of<br />
horses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans,<br />
if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot;<br />
he must go to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as<br />
heretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeans<br />
design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep<br />
their watches.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain<br />
man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in gold<br />
and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only<br />
son among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.<br />
&#8220;I, Hector,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Will to the ships and will exploit them. But<br />
first hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the<br />
chariot, bedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the<br />
noble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail<br />
you. I will go through the host from one end to the other till I<br />
come to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the<br />
Achaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight or fly.&#8221;<br />
When he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore<br />
him his oath saying, &#8220;May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear<br />
witness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds,<br />
and that you shall have your will with them for ever.&#8221;<br />
The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on<br />
going. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore<br />
the skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret<br />
skin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships,<br />
but he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left<br />
the horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way,<br />
but Ulysses perceived his coming and said to Diomed, &#8220;Diomed, here<br />
is some one from the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or<br />
whether it is some thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; let<br />
him get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take him.<br />
If, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spear<br />
and hem him in towards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent<br />
his getting back to the town.&#8221;<br />
With this they turned out of their way and lay down among the<br />
corpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had<br />
got about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds<br />
one that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land<br />
quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their<br />
footsteps he stood still, for he made sure they were friends from<br />
the Trojan camp come by Hector&#8217;s orders to bid him return; when,<br />
however, they were only a spear&#8217;s cast, or less away form him, he<br />
saw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The<br />
others gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds<br />
press forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of<br />
them, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut<br />
him off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards the<br />
ships that he would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva<br />
infused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of<br />
the Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he<br />
might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with his<br />
spear and said, &#8220;Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that case<br />
I shall soon make an end of you.&#8221;<br />
He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew<br />
over the man&#8217;s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He<br />
stood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered,<br />
and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and<br />
seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, &#8220;Take me alive; I<br />
will ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought<br />
iron, and from this my father will satisfy you with a very large<br />
ransom, should he hear of my being alive at the ships of the<br />
Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Fear not,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;let no thought of death be in your<br />
mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about<br />
alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the<br />
ships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of<br />
the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at<br />
the ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?&#8221;<br />
Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: &#8220;Hector, with his<br />
vain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said<br />
he would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his<br />
bronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the<br />
flying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the ships<br />
are still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten<br />
them, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are<br />
neglecting to keep their watches.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses smiled at him and answered, &#8220;You had indeed set your heart<br />
upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are<br />
hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than<br />
Achilles himself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and<br />
tell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started? Where<br />
lies his armour and his horses? How, too, are the watches and<br />
sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their plans? Will<br />
they stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that they<br />
have worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?&#8221;<br />
And Dolon answered, &#8220;I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other<br />
councillors are now holding conference by the monument of great<br />
Ilus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about which<br />
you ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host.<br />
The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them;<br />
they, therefore, are awake and keep each other to their duty as<br />
sentinels; but the allies who have come from other places are asleep<br />
and leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and<br />
children are not here.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses then said, &#8220;Now tell me; are they sleeping among the<br />
Trojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may<br />
understand it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you truly all,&#8221; replied Dolon. &#8220;To the seaward lie<br />
the Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the<br />
noble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and<br />
Meonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask<br />
about an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the<br />
Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie<br />
apart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus<br />
son of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest<br />
that I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than<br />
any wind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold,<br />
and he has brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest<br />
workmanship- too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only<br />
for the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely<br />
here, until you come back and have proved my words whether they be<br />
false or true.&#8221;<br />
Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, &#8220;Think not, Dolon, for<br />
all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape<br />
now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will<br />
come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy<br />
or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will<br />
give no more trouble.&#8221;<br />
On this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him<br />
further, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his<br />
sword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the<br />
dust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his<br />
head, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses<br />
hung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and<br />
prayed saying, &#8220;Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in<br />
preference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still<br />
further towards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.&#8221;<br />
With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk<br />
tree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering<br />
boughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back<br />
through the&#8217; flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards<br />
amid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the<br />
company of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with<br />
their day&#8217;s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground beside<br />
them all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses<br />
beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his<br />
horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses<br />
from some way off saw him and said, &#8220;This, Diomed, is the man, and<br />
these are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your<br />
very utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses at<br />
once- or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses.&#8221;<br />
Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote<br />
them right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being<br />
hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion<br />
springs furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without<br />
their shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian<br />
soldiers till he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and<br />
drew them aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go<br />
forward freely without being frightened as they passed over the dead<br />
bodies, for they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus<br />
came to the king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was<br />
breathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the<br />
seed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses<br />
untied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,<br />
striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from<br />
the chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.<br />
But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he<br />
might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which<br />
the king&#8217;s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift<br />
the armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not<br />
kill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up<br />
to him and said, &#8220;Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be<br />
driven thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.&#8221;<br />
Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the<br />
horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the<br />
ships of the Achaeans.<br />
But Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son<br />
of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the<br />
Trojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble<br />
kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the<br />
horses were no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in<br />
their death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his<br />
friend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the<br />
people kept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of<br />
the heroes who had now got away towards the ships.<br />
When they reached the place where they had killed Hector&#8217;s scout,<br />
Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the<br />
ground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and<br />
remounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward<br />
nothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will.<br />
Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said<br />
he, &#8220;princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or<br />
wrong?- but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of<br />
the tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving in<br />
horses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the<br />
Argives may have come to some harm at their hands.&#8221;<br />
He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,<br />
whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and<br />
congratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question<br />
them. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by<br />
these horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some<br />
god meet you and give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well<br />
conversant with the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never<br />
hold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as<br />
these are. Surely some god must have met you and given them to you,<br />
for you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove&#8217;s daughter Minerva.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean<br />
name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than<br />
these, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,<br />
however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace.<br />
Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions.<br />
Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and<br />
the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.&#8221;<br />
He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while<br />
the other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly<br />
built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with<br />
thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood<br />
eating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils<br />
of Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred<br />
offering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and<br />
washed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs.<br />
When the sea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had<br />
refreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves.<br />
After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they<br />
sat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a<br />
drink-offering of wine to Minerva.</p>
