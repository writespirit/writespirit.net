				<p>The Creation of the World </p>
<p>Of bodies chang&#8217;d to various forms, I sing: <br />
Ye Gods, from whom these miracles did spring, <br />
Inspire my numbers with coelestial heat; <br />
&#8216;Till I my long laborious work compleat: <br />
And add perpetual tenour to my rhimes, <br />
Deduc&#8217;d from Nature&#8217;s birth, to Caesar&#8217;s times. <br />
Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball, <br />
And Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s high canopy, that covers all, <br />
One was the face of Nature; if a face: <br />
Rather a rude and indigested mass: <br />
A lifeless lump, unfashion&#8217;d, and unfram&#8217;d, <br />
Of jarring seeds; and justly Chaos nam&#8217;d. <br />
No sun was lighted up, the world to view; <br />
No moon did yet her blunted horns renew: <br />
Nor yet was Earth suspended in the sky, <br />
Nor pois&#8217;d, did on her own foundations lye: <br />
Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown; <br />
But earth, and air, and water, were in one. <br />
Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable, <br />
And water&#8217;s dark abyss unnavigable. <br />
No certain form on any was imprest; <br />
All were confus&#8217;d, and each disturb&#8217;d the rest. <br />
For hot and cold were in one body fixt; <br />
And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.</p>
<p>But God, or Nature, while they thus contend, <br />
To these intestine discords put an end: <br />
Then earth from air, and seas from earth were driv&#8217;n, <br />
And grosser air sunk from aetherial Heav&#8217;n. <br />
Thus disembroil&#8217;d, they take their proper place; <br />
The next of kin, contiguously embrace; <br />
And foes are sunder&#8217;d, by a larger space. <br />
The force of fire ascended first on high, <br />
And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky: <br />
Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire; <br />
Whose atoms from unactive earth retire. <br />
Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num&#8217;rous throng <br />
Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along. <br />
About her coasts, unruly waters roar; <br />
And rising, on a ridge, insult the shore. <br />
Thus when the God, whatever God was he, <br />
Had form&#8217;d the whole, and made the parts agree, <br />
That no unequal portions might be found, <br />
He moulded Earth into a spacious round: <br />
Then with a breath, he gave the winds to blow; <br />
And bad the congregated waters flow. <br />
He adds the running springs, and standing lakes; <br />
And bounding banks for winding rivers makes. <br />
Some part, in Earth are swallow&#8217;d up, the most <br />
In ample oceans, disembogu&#8217;d, are lost. <br />
He shades the woods, the vallies he restrains <br />
With rocky mountains, and extends the plains.</p>
<p>And as five zones th&#8217; aetherial regions bind, <br />
Five, correspondent, are to Earth assign&#8217;d: <br />
The sun with rays, directly darting down, <br />
Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone: <br />
The two beneath the distant poles, complain <br />
Of endless winter, and perpetual rain. <br />
Betwixt th&#8217; extreams, two happier climates hold <br />
The temper that partakes of hot, and cold. <br />
The fields of liquid air, inclosing all, <br />
Surround the compass of this earthly ball: <br />
The lighter parts lye next the fires above; <br />
The grosser near the watry surface move: <br />
Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there, <br />
And thunder&#8217;s voice, which wretched mortals fear, <br />
And winds that on their wings cold winter bear. <br />
Nor were those blustring brethren left at large, <br />
On seas, and shores, their fury to discharge: <br />
Bound as they are, and circumscrib&#8217;d in place, <br />
They rend the world, resistless, where they pass; <br />
And mighty marks of mischief leave behind; <br />
Such is the rage of their tempestuous kind. <br />
First Eurus to the rising morn is sent <br />
(The regions of the balmy continent); <br />
And Eastern realms, where early Persians run, <br />
To greet the blest appearance of the sun. <br />
Westward, the wanton Zephyr wings his flight; <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the remnants of departing light: <br />
Fierce Boreas, with his off-spring, issues forth <br />
T&#8217; invade the frozen waggon of the North. <br />
While frowning Auster seeks the Southern sphere; <br />
And rots, with endless rain, th&#8217; unwholsom year.</p>
<p>High o&#8217;er the clouds, and empty realms of wind, <br />
The God a clearer space for Heav&#8217;n design&#8217;d; <br />
Where fields of light, and liquid aether flow; <br />
Purg&#8217;d from the pondrous dregs of Earth below.</p>
<p>Scarce had the Pow&#8217;r distinguish&#8217;d these, when streight <br />
The stars, no longer overlaid with weight, <br />
Exert their heads, from underneath the mass; <br />
And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass, <br />
And with diffusive light adorn their heav&#8217;nly place. <br />
Then, every void of Nature to supply, <br />
With forms of Gods he fills the vacant sky: <br />
New herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share: <br />
New colonies of birds, to people air: <br />
And to their oozy beds, the finny fish repair.</p>
<p>A creature of a more exalted kind <br />
Was wanting yet, and then was Man design&#8217;d: <br />
Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast, <br />
For empire form&#8217;d, and fit to rule the rest: <br />
Whether with particles of heav&#8217;nly fire <br />
The God of Nature did his soul inspire, <br />
Or Earth, but new divided from the sky, <br />
And, pliant, still retain&#8217;d th&#8217; aetherial energy: <br />
Which wise Prometheus temper&#8217;d into paste, <br />
And, mixt with living streams, the godlike image cast.</p>
<p>Thus, while the mute creation downward bend <br />
Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend, <br />
Man looks aloft; and with erected eyes <br />
Beholds his own hereditary skies. <br />
From such rude principles our form began; <br />
And earth was metamorphos&#8217;d into Man.</p>
<p>The Golden Age</p>
<p>The golden age was first; when Man yet new, <br />
No rule but uncorrupted reason knew: <br />
And, with a native bent, did good pursue. <br />
Unforc&#8217;d by punishment, un-aw&#8217;d by fear, <br />
His words were simple, and his soul sincere; <br />
Needless was written law, where none opprest: <br />
The law of Man was written in his breast: <br />
No suppliant crowds before the judge appear&#8217;d, <br />
No court erected yet, nor cause was heard: <br />
But all was safe, for conscience was their guard. <br />
The mountain-trees in distant prospect please, <br />
E&#8217;re yet the pine descended to the seas: <br />
E&#8217;re sails were spread, new oceans to explore: <br />
And happy mortals, unconcern&#8217;d for more, <br />
Confin&#8217;d their wishes to their native shore. <br />
No walls were yet; nor fence, nor mote, nor mound, <br />
Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet&#8217;s angry sound: <br />
Nor swords were forg&#8217;d; but void of care and crime, <br />
The soft creation slept away their time. <br />
The teeming Earth, yet guiltless of the plough, <br />
And unprovok&#8217;d, did fruitful stores allow: <br />
Content with food, which Nature freely bred, <br />
On wildings and on strawberries they fed; <br />
Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest, <br />
And falling acorns furnish&#8217;d out a feast. <br />
The flow&#8217;rs unsown, in fields and meadows reign&#8217;d: <br />
And Western winds immortal spring maintain&#8217;d. <br />
In following years, the bearded corn ensu&#8217;d <br />
From Earth unask&#8217;d, nor was that Earth renew&#8217;d. <br />
From veins of vallies, milk and nectar broke; <br />
And honey sweating through the pores of oak.</p>
<p>The Silver Age</p>
<p>But when good Saturn, banish&#8217;d from above, <br />
Was driv&#8217;n to Hell, the world was under Jove. <br />
Succeeding times a silver age behold, <br />
Excelling brass, but more excell&#8217;d by gold. <br />
Then summer, autumn, winter did appear: <br />
And spring was but a season of the year. <br />
The sun his annual course obliquely made, <br />
Good days contracted, and enlarg&#8217;d the bad. <br />
Then air with sultry heats began to glow; <br />
The wings of winds were clogg&#8217;d with ice and snow; <br />
And shivering mortals, into houses driv&#8217;n, <br />
Sought shelter from th&#8217; inclemency of Heav&#8217;n. <br />
Those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds; <br />
With twining oziers fenc&#8217;d; and moss their beds. <br />
Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke, <br />
And oxen labour&#8217;d first beneath the yoke.</p>
<p>The Brazen Age</p>
<p>To this came next in course, the brazen age: <br />
A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage, <br />
Not impious yet&#8230;</p>
<p>The Iron Age</p>
<p>Hard steel succeeded then: <br />
And stubborn as the metal, were the men. <br />
Truth, modesty, and shame, the world forsook: <br />
Fraud, avarice, and force, their places took. <br />
Then sails were spread, to every wind that blew. <br />
Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new: <br />
Trees, rudely hollow&#8217;d, did the waves sustain; <br />
E&#8217;re ships in triumph plough&#8217;d the watry plain.</p>
<p>Then land-marks limited to each his right: <br />
For all before was common as the light. <br />
Nor was the ground alone requir&#8217;d to bear <br />
Her annual income to the crooked share, <br />
But greedy mortals, rummaging her store, <br />
Digg&#8217;d from her entrails first the precious oar; <br />
Which next to Hell, the prudent Gods had laid; <br />
And that alluring ill, to sight display&#8217;d. <br />
Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold, <br />
Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold: <br />
And double death did wretched Man invade, <br />
By steel assaulted, and by gold betray&#8217;d, <br />
Now (brandish&#8217;d weapons glittering in their hands) <br />
Mankind is broken loose from moral bands; <br />
No rights of hospitality remain: <br />
The guest, by him who harbour&#8217;d him, is slain, <br />
The son-in-law pursues the father&#8217;s life; <br />
The wife her husband murders, he the wife. <br />
The step-dame poyson for the son prepares; <br />
The son inquires into his father&#8217;s years. <br />
Faith flies, and piety in exile mourns; <br />
And justice, here opprest, to Heav&#8217;n returns.</p>
<p>The Giants&#8217; War</p>
<p>Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above; <br />
Against beleaguer&#8217;d Heav&#8217;n the giants move. <br />
Hills pil&#8217;d on hills, on mountains mountains lie, <br />
To make their mad approaches to the skie. <br />
&#8216;Till Jove, no longer patient, took his time <br />
T&#8217; avenge with thunder their audacious crime: <br />
Red light&#8217;ning plaid along the firmament, <br />
And their demolish&#8217;d works to pieces rent. <br />
Sing&#8217;d with the flames, and with the bolts transfixt, <br />
With native Earth, their blood the monsters mixt; <br />
The blood, indu&#8217;d with animating heat, <br />
Did in th&#8217; impregnant Earth new sons beget: <br />
They, like the seed from which they sprung, accurst, <br />
Against the Gods immortal hatred nurst, <br />
An impious, arrogant, and cruel brood; <br />
Expressing their original from blood.</p>
<p>Which when the king of Gods beheld from high <br />
(Withal revolving in his memory, <br />
What he himself had found on Earth of late, <br />
Lycaon&#8217;s guilt, and his inhumane treat), <br />
He sigh&#8217;d; nor longer with his pity strove; <br />
But kindled to a wrath becoming Jove:</p>
<p>Then call&#8217;d a general council of the Gods; <br />
Who summon&#8217;d, issue from their blest abodes, <br />
And fill th&#8217; assembly with a shining train. <br />
A way there is, in Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s expanded plain, <br />
Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below, <br />
And mortals, by the name of Milky, know. <br />
The ground-work is of stars; through which the road <br />
Lyes open to the Thunderer&#8217;s abode: <br />
The Gods of greater nations dwell around, <br />
And, on the right and left, the palace bound; <br />
The commons where they can: the nobler sort <br />
With winding-doors wide open, front the court. <br />
This place, as far as Earth with Heav&#8217;n may vie, <br />
I dare to call the Louvre of the skie. <br />
When all were plac&#8217;d, in seats distinctly known, <br />
And he, their father, had assum&#8217;d the throne, <br />
Upon his iv&#8217;ry sceptre first he leant, <br />
Then shook his head, that shook the firmament: <br />
Air, Earth, and seas, obey&#8217;d th&#8217; almighty nod; <br />
And, with a gen&#8217;ral fear, confess&#8217;d the God. <br />
At length, with indignation, thus he broke <br />
His awful silence, and the Pow&#8217;rs bespoke.</p>
<p>I was not more concern&#8217;d in that debate <br />
Of empire, when our universal state <br />
Was put to hazard, and the giant race <br />
Our captive skies were ready to imbrace: <br />
For tho&#8217; the foe was fierce, the seeds of all <br />
Rebellion, sprung from one original; <br />
Now, wheresoever ambient waters glide, <br />
All are corrupt, and all must be destroy&#8217;d. <br />
Let me this holy protestation make, <br />
By Hell, and Hell&#8217;s inviolable lake, <br />
I try&#8217;d whatever in the godhead lay: <br />
But gangren&#8217;d members must be lopt away, <br />
Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay. <br />
There dwells below, a race of demi-gods, <br />
Of nymphs in waters, and of fawns in woods: <br />
Who, tho&#8217; not worthy yet, in Heav&#8217;n to live, <br />
Let &#8216;em, at least, enjoy that Earth we give. <br />
Can these be thought securely lodg&#8217;d below, <br />
When I my self, who no superior know, <br />
I, who have Heav&#8217;n and Earth at my command, <br />
Have been attempted by Lycaon&#8217;s hand?</p>
<p>At this a murmur through the synod went, <br />
And with one voice they vote his punishment. <br />
Thus, when conspiring traytors dar&#8217;d to doom <br />
The fall of Caesar, and in him of Rome, <br />
The nations trembled with a pious fear; <br />
All anxious for their earthly Thunderer: <br />
Nor was their care, o Caesar, less esteem&#8217;d <br />
By thee, than that of Heav&#8217;n for Jove was deem&#8217;d: <br />
Who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain <br />
Their murmurs, then resum&#8217;d his speech again. <br />
The Gods to silence were compos&#8217;d, and sate <br />
With reverence, due to his superior state.</p>
<p>Cancel your pious cares; already he <br />
Has paid his debt to justice, and to me. <br />
Yet what his crimes, and what my judgments were, <br />
Remains for me thus briefly to declare. <br />
The clamours of this vile degenerate age, <br />
The cries of orphans, and th&#8217; oppressor&#8217;s rage, <br />
Had reach&#8217;d the stars: I will descend, said I, <br />
In hope to prove this loud complaint a lye. <br />
Disguis&#8217;d in humane shape, I travell&#8217;d round <br />
The world, and more than what I heard, I found. <br />
O&#8217;er Maenalus I took my steepy way, <br />
By caverns infamous for beasts of prey: <br />
Then cross&#8217;d Cyllene, and the piny shade <br />
More infamous, by curst Lycaon made: <br />
Dark night had cover&#8217;d Heaven, and Earth, before <br />
I enter&#8217;d his unhospitable door. <br />
Just at my entrance, I display&#8217;d the sign <br />
That somewhat was approaching of divine. <br />
The prostrate people pray; the tyrant grins; <br />
And, adding prophanation to his sins, <br />
I&#8217;ll try, said he, and if a God appear, <br />
To prove his deity shall cost him dear. <br />
&#8216;Twas late; the graceless wretch my death prepares, <br />
When I shou&#8217;d soundly sleep, opprest with cares: <br />
This dire experiment he chose, to prove <br />
If I were mortal, or undoubted Jove: <br />
But first he had resolv&#8217;d to taste my pow&#8217;r; <br />
Not long before, but in a luckless hour, <br />
Some legates, sent from the Molossian state, <br />
Were on a peaceful errand come to treat: <br />
Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh; <br />
And lays the mangled morsels in a dish: <br />
Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest, <br />
And bids me welcome to this humane feast. <br />
Mov&#8217;d with disdain, the table I o&#8217;er-turn&#8217;d; <br />
And with avenging flames, the palace burn&#8217;d. <br />
The tyrant in a fright, for shelter gains <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring fields, and scours along the plains. <br />
Howling he fled, and fain he wou&#8217;d have spoke; <br />
But humane voice his brutal tongue forsook. <br />
About his lips the gather&#8217;d foam he churns, <br />
And, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns, <br />
But on the bleating flock his fury turns. <br />
His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs <br />
Cleaves to his back; a famish&#8217;d face he bears; <br />
His arms descend, his shoulders sink away <br />
To multiply his legs for chase of prey. <br />
He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains, <br />
And the same rage in other members reigns. <br />
His eyes still sparkle in a narr&#8217;wer space: <br />
His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face</p>
<p>This was a single ruin, but not one <br />
Deserves so just a punishment alone. <br />
Mankind&#8217;s a monster, and th&#8217; ungodly times <br />
Confed&#8217;rate into guilt, are sworn to crimes. <br />
All are alike involv&#8217;d in ill, and all <br />
Must by the same relentless fury fall. <br />
Thus ended he; the greater Gods assent; <br />
By clamours urging his severe intent; <br />
The less fill up the cry for punishment. <br />
Yet still with pity they remember Man; <br />
And mourn as much as heav&#8217;nly spirits can. <br />
They ask, when those were lost of humane birth, <br />
What he wou&#8217;d do with all this waste of Earth: <br />
If his dispeopl&#8217;d world he would resign <br />
To beasts, a mute, and more ignoble line; <br />
Neglected altars must no longer smoke, <br />
If none were left to worship, and invoke. <br />
To whom the Father of the Gods reply&#8217;d, <br />
Lay that unnecessary fear aside: <br />
Mine be the care, new people to provide. <br />
I will from wondrous principles ordain <br />
A race unlike the first, and try my skill again.</p>
<p>Already had he toss&#8217;d the flaming brand; <br />
And roll&#8217;d the thunder in his spacious hand; <br />
Preparing to discharge on seas and land: <br />
But stopt, for fear, thus violently driv&#8217;n, <br />
The sparks should catch his axle-tree of Heav&#8217;n. <br />
Remembring in the fates, a time when fire <br />
Shou&#8217;d to the battlements of Heaven aspire, <br />
And all his blazing worlds above shou&#8217;d burn; <br />
And all th&#8217; inferior globe to cinders turn. <br />
His dire artill&#8217;ry thus dismist, he bent <br />
His thoughts to some securer punishment: <br />
Concludes to pour a watry deluge down; <br />
And what he durst not burn, resolves to drown.</p>
<p>The northern breath, that freezes floods, he binds; <br />
With all the race of cloud-dispelling winds: <br />
The south he loos&#8217;d, who night and horror brings; <br />
And foggs are shaken from his flaggy wings. <br />
From his divided beard two streams he pours, <br />
His head, and rheumy eyes distill in show&#8217;rs, <br />
With rain his robe, and heavy mantle flow: <br />
And lazy mists are lowring on his brow; <br />
Still as he swept along, with his clench&#8217;d fist <br />
He squeez&#8217;d the clouds, th&#8217; imprison&#8217;d clouds resist: <br />
The skies, from pole to pole, with peals resound; <br />
And show&#8217;rs inlarg&#8217;d, come pouring on the ground. <br />
Then, clad in colours of a various dye, <br />
Junonian Iris breeds a new supply <br />
To feed the clouds: impetuous rain descends; <br />
The bearded corn beneath the burden bends: <br />
Defrauded clowns deplore their perish&#8217;d grain; <br />
And the long labours of the year are vain.</p>
<p>Nor from his patrimonial Heaven alone <br />
Is Jove content to pour his vengeance down; <br />
Aid from his brother of the seas he craves, <br />
To help him with auxiliary waves. <br />
The watry tyrant calls his brooks and floods, <br />
Who rowl from mossie caves (their moist abodes); <br />
And with perpetual urns his palace fill: <br />
To whom in brief, he thus imparts his will.</p>
<p>Small exhortation needs; your pow&#8217;rs employ: <br />
And this bad world, so Jove requires, destroy. <br />
Let loose the reins to all your watry store: <br />
Bear down the damms, and open ev&#8217;ry door.</p>
<p>The floods, by Nature enemies to land, <br />
And proudly swelling with their new command, <br />
Remove the living stones, that stopt their way, <br />
And gushing from their source, augment the sea. <br />
Then, with his mace, their monarch struck the ground; <br />
With inward trembling Earth receiv&#8217;d the wound; <br />
And rising streams a ready passage found. <br />
Th&#8217; expanded waters gather on the plain: <br />
They float the fields, and over-top the grain; <br />
Then rushing onwards, with a sweepy sway, <br />
Bear flocks, and folds, and lab&#8217;ring hinds away. <br />
Nor safe their dwellings were, for, sap&#8217;d by floods, <br />
Their houses fell upon their houshold Gods. <br />
The solid piles, too strongly built to fall, <br />
High o&#8217;er their heads, behold a watry wall: <br />
Now seas and Earth were in confusion lost; <br />
A world of waters, and without a coast.</p>
<p>One climbs a cliff; one in his boat is born: <br />
And ploughs above, where late he sow&#8217;d his corn. <br />
Others o&#8217;er chimney-tops and turrets row, <br />
And drop their anchors on the meads below: <br />
Or downward driv&#8217;n, they bruise the tender vine, <br />
Or tost aloft, are knock&#8217;d against a pine. <br />
And where of late the kids had cropt the grass, <br />
The monsters of the deep now take their place. <br />
Insulting Nereids on the cities ride, <br />
And wond&#8217;ring dolphins o&#8217;er the palace glide. <br />
On leaves, and masts of mighty oaks they brouze; <br />
And their broad fins entangle in the boughs. <br />
The frighted wolf now swims amongst the sheep; <br />
The yellow lion wanders in the deep: <br />
His rapid force no longer helps the boar: <br />
The stag swims faster, than he ran before. <br />
The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain, <br />
Despair of land, and drop into the main. <br />
Now hills, and vales no more distinction know; <br />
And levell&#8217;d Nature lies oppress&#8217;d below. <br />
The most of mortals perish in the flood: <br />
The small remainder dies for want of food.</p>
<p>A mountain of stupendous height there stands <br />
Betwixt th&#8217; Athenian and Boeotian lands, <br />
The bound of fruitful fields, while fields they were, <br />
But then a field of waters did appear: <br />
Parnassus is its name; whose forky rise <br />
Mounts thro&#8217; the clouds, and mates the lofty skies. <br />
High on the summit of this dubious cliff, <br />
Deucalion wafting, moor&#8217;d his little skiff. <br />
He with his wife were only left behind <br />
Of perish&#8217;d Man; they two were human kind. <br />
The mountain nymphs, and Themis they adore, <br />
And from her oracles relief implore. <br />
The most upright of mortal men was he; <br />
The most sincere, and holy woman, she.</p>
<p>When Jupiter, surveying Earth from high, <br />
Beheld it in a lake of water lie, <br />
That where so many millions lately liv&#8217;d, <br />
But two, the best of either sex, surviv&#8217;d; <br />
He loos&#8217;d the northern wind; fierce Boreas flies <br />
To puff away the clouds, and purge the skies: <br />
Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driv&#8217;n, <br />
Discover Heav&#8217;n to Earth, and Earth to Heav&#8217;n. <br />
The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace <br />
On the rough sea, and smooths its furrow&#8217;d face. <br />
Already Triton, at his call, appears <br />
Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears; <br />
And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears. <br />
The soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire, <br />
And give the waves the signal to retire. <br />
His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent <br />
Grows by degrees into a large extent, <br />
Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound, <br />
Runs the wide circuit of the world around: <br />
The sun first heard it, in his early east, <br />
And met the rattling ecchos in the west. <br />
The waters, listning to the trumpet&#8217;s roar, <br />
Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.</p>
<p>A thin circumference of land appears; <br />
And Earth, but not at once, her visage rears, <br />
And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds; <br />
The streams, but just contain&#8217;d within their bounds, <br />
By slow degrees into their channels crawl; <br />
And Earth increases, as the waters fall. <br />
In longer time the tops of trees appear, <br />
Which mud on their dishonour&#8217;d branches bear.</p>
<p>At length the world was all restor&#8217;d to view; <br />
But desolate, and of a sickly hue: <br />
Nature beheld her self, and stood aghast, <br />
A dismal desart, and a silent waste.</p>
<p>Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look <br />
Beheld, he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke: <br />
Oh wife, oh sister, oh of all thy kind <br />
The best, and only creature left behind, <br />
By kindred, love, and now by dangers joyn&#8217;d; <br />
Of multitudes, who breath&#8217;d the common air, <br />
We two remain; a species in a pair: <br />
The rest the seas have swallow&#8217;d; nor have we <br />
Ev&#8217;n of this wretched life a certainty. <br />
The clouds are still above; and, while I speak, <br />
A second deluge o&#8217;er our heads may break. <br />
Shou&#8217;d I be snatcht from hence, and thou remain, <br />
Without relief, or partner of thy pain, <br />
How cou&#8217;dst thou such a wretched life sustain? <br />
Shou&#8217;d I be left, and thou be lost, the sea <br />
That bury&#8217;d her I lov&#8217;d, shou&#8217;d bury me. <br />
Oh cou&#8217;d our father his old arts inspire, <br />
And make me heir of his informing fire, <br />
That so I might abolisht Man retrieve, <br />
And perisht people in new souls might live. <br />
But Heav&#8217;n is pleas&#8217;d, nor ought we to complain, <br />
That we, th&#8217; examples of mankind, remain. <br />
He said; the careful couple joyn their tears: <br />
And then invoke the Gods, with pious prayers. <br />
Thus, in devotion having eas&#8217;d their grief, <br />
From sacred oracles they seek relief; <br />
And to Cephysus&#8217; brook their way pursue: <br />
The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew; <br />
With living waters, in the fountain bred, <br />
They sprinkle first their garments, and their head, <br />
Then took the way, which to the temple led. <br />
The roofs were all defil&#8217;d with moss, and mire, <br />
The desart altars void of solemn fire. <br />
Before the gradual, prostrate they ador&#8217;d; <br />
The pavement kiss&#8217;d; and thus the saint implor&#8217;d.</p>
<p>O righteous Themis, if the Pow&#8217;rs above <br />
By pray&#8217;rs are bent to pity, and to love; <br />
If humane miseries can move their mind; <br />
If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind; <br />
Tell how we may restore, by second birth, <br />
Mankind, and people desolated Earth. <br />
Then thus the gracious Goddess, nodding, said; <br />
Depart, and with your vestments veil your head: <br />
And stooping lowly down, with losen&#8217;d zones, <br />
Throw each behind your backs, your mighty mother&#8217;s bones. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d the pair, and mute with wonder stand, <br />
&#8216;Till Pyrrha first refus&#8217;d the dire command. <br />
Forbid it Heav&#8217;n, said she, that I shou&#8217;d tear <br />
Those holy reliques from the sepulcher. <br />
They ponder&#8217;d the mysterious words again, <br />
For some new sense; and long they sought in vain: <br />
At length Deucalion clear&#8217;d his cloudy brow, <br />
And said, the dark Aenigma will allow <br />
A meaning, which, if well I understand, <br />
From sacrilege will free the God&#8217;s command: <br />
This Earth our mighty mother is, the stones <br />
In her capacious body, are her bones: <br />
These we must cast behind. With hope, and fear, <br />
The woman did the new solution hear: <br />
The man diffides in his own augury, <br />
And doubts the Gods; yet both resolve to try. <br />
Descending from the mount, they first unbind <br />
Their vests, and veil&#8217;d, they cast the stones behind: <br />
The stones (a miracle to mortal view, <br />
But long tradition makes it pass for true) <br />
Did first the rigour of their kind expel, <br />
And suppled into softness, as they fell; <br />
Then swell&#8217;d, and swelling, by degrees grew warm; <br />
And took the rudiments of human form. <br />
Imperfect shapes: in marble such are seen, <br />
When the rude chizzel does the man begin; <br />
While yet the roughness of the stone remains, <br />
Without the rising muscles, and the veins. <br />
The sappy parts, and next resembling juice, <br />
Were turn&#8217;d to moisture, for the body&#8217;s use: <br />
Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment; <br />
The rest, too solid to receive a bent, <br />
Converts to bones; and what was once a vein, <br />
Its former name and Nature did retain. <br />
By help of pow&#8217;r divine, in little space, <br />
What the man threw, assum&#8217;d a manly face; <br />
And what the wife, renew&#8217;d the female race. <br />
Hence we derive our nature; born to bear <br />
Laborious life; and harden&#8217;d into care.</p>
<p>The rest of animals, from teeming Earth <br />
Produc&#8217;d, in various forms receiv&#8217;d their birth. <br />
The native moisture, in its close retreat, <br />
Digested by the sun&#8217;s aetherial heat, <br />
As in a kindly womb, began to breed: <br />
Then swell&#8217;d, and quicken&#8217;d by the vital seed. <br />
And some in less, and some in longer space, <br />
Were ripen&#8217;d into form, and took a sev&#8217;ral face. <br />
Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fled, <br />
And seeks, with ebbing tides, his ancient bed, <br />
The fat manure with heav&#8217;nly fire is warm&#8217;d; <br />
And crusted creatures, as in wombs, are form&#8217;d; <br />
These, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find; <br />
Some rude, and yet unfinish&#8217;d in their kind: <br />
Short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth: <br />
One half alive; and one of lifeless earth.</p>
<p>For heat, and moisture, when in bodies join&#8217;d, <br />
The temper that results from either kind <br />
Conception makes; and fighting &#8217;till they mix, <br />
Their mingled atoms in each other fix. <br />
Thus Nature&#8217;s hand the genial bed prepares <br />
With friendly discord, and with fruitful wars.</p>
<p>From hence the surface of the ground, with mud <br />
And slime besmear&#8217;d (the faeces of the flood), <br />
Receiv&#8217;d the rays of Heav&#8217;n: and sucking in <br />
The seeds of heat, new creatures did begin: <br />
Some were of sev&#8217;ral sorts produc&#8217;d before, <br />
But of new monsters, Earth created more. <br />
Unwillingly, but yet she brought to light <br />
Thee, Python too, the wondring world to fright, <br />
And the new nations, with so dire a sight: <br />
So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space <br />
Did his vast body, and long train embrace. <br />
Whom Phoebus basking on a bank espy&#8217;d; <br />
E&#8217;re now the God his arrows had not try&#8217;d <br />
But on the trembling deer, or mountain goat; <br />
At this new quarry he prepares to shoot. <br />
Though ev&#8217;ry shaft took place, he spent the store <br />
Of his full quiver; and &#8217;twas long before <br />
Th&#8217; expiring serpent wallow&#8217;d in his gore. <br />
Then, to preserve the fame of such a deed, <br />
For Python slain, he Pythian games decred. <br />
Where noble youths for mastership shou&#8217;d strive, <br />
To quoit, to run, and steeds, and chariots drive. <br />
The prize was fame: in witness of renown <br />
An oaken garland did the victor crown. <br />
The laurel was not yet for triumphs born; <br />
But every green alike by Phoebus worn, <br />
Did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing locks adorn.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Daphne into a Lawrel</p>
<p>The first and fairest of his loves, was she <br />
Whom not blind fortune, but the dire decree <br />
Of angry Cupid forc&#8217;d him to desire: <br />
Daphne her name, and Peneus was her sire. <br />
Swell&#8217;d with the pride, that new success attends, <br />
He sees the stripling, while his bow he bends, <br />
And thus insults him: Thou lascivious boy, <br />
Are arms like these for children to employ? <br />
Know, such atchievements are my proper claim; <br />
Due to my vigour, and unerring aim: <br />
Resistless are my shafts, and Python late <br />
In such a feather&#8217;d death, has found his fate. <br />
Take up the torch (and lay my weapons by), <br />
With that the feeble souls of lovers fry. <br />
To whom the son of Venus thus reply&#8217;d, <br />
Phoebus, thy shafts are sure on all beside, <br />
But mine of Phoebus, mine the fame shall be <br />
Of all thy conquests, when I conquer thee.</p>
<p>He said, and soaring, swiftly wing&#8217;d his flight: <br />
Nor stopt but on Parnassus&#8217; airy height. <br />
Two diff&#8217;rent shafts he from his quiver draws; <br />
One to repel desire, and one to cause. <br />
One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold: <br />
To bribe the love, and make the lover bold: <br />
One blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay <br />
Provokes disdain, and drives desire away. <br />
The blunted bolt against the nymph he drest: <br />
But with the sharp transfixt Apollo&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; enamour&#8217;d deity pursues the chace; <br />
The scornful damsel shuns his loath&#8217;d embrace: <br />
In hunting beasts of prey, her youth employs; <br />
And Phoebe rivals in her rural joys. <br />
With naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare; <br />
And with a fillet binds her flowing hair. <br />
By many suitors sought, she mocks their pains, <br />
And still her vow&#8217;d virginity maintains. <br />
Impatient of a yoke, the name of bride <br />
She shuns, and hates the joys, she never try&#8217;d. <br />
On wilds, and woods, she fixes her desire: <br />
Nor knows what youth, and kindly love, inspire. <br />
Her father chides her oft: Thou ow&#8217;st, says he, <br />
A husband to thy self, a son to me. <br />
She, like a crime, abhors the nuptial bed: <br />
She glows with blushes, and she hangs her head. <br />
Then casting round his neck her tender arms, <br />
Sooths him with blandishments, and filial charms: <br />
Give me, my Lord, she said, to live, and die, <br />
A spotless maid, without the marriage tye. <br />
&#8216;Tis but a small request; I beg no more <br />
Than what Diana&#8217;s father gave before. <br />
The good old sire was soften&#8217;d to consent; <br />
But said her wish wou&#8217;d prove her punishment: <br />
For so much youth, and so much beauty join&#8217;d, <br />
Oppos&#8217;d the state, which her desires design&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The God of light, aspiring to her bed, <br />
Hopes what he seeks, with flattering fancies fed; <br />
And is, by his own oracles, mis-led. <br />
And as in empty fields the stubble burns, <br />
Or nightly travellers, when day returns, <br />
Their useless torches on dry hedges throw, <br />
That catch the flames, and kindle all the row; <br />
So burns the God, consuming in desire, <br />
And feeding in his breast a fruitless fire: <br />
Her well-turn&#8217;d neck he view&#8217;d (her neck was bare) <br />
And on her shoulders her dishevel&#8217;d hair; <br />
Oh were it comb&#8217;d, said he, with what a grace <br />
Wou&#8217;d every waving curl become her face! <br />
He view&#8217;d her eyes, like heav&#8217;nly lamps that shone, <br />
He view&#8217;d her lips, too sweet to view alone, <br />
Her taper fingers, and her panting breast; <br />
He praises all he sees, and for the rest <br />
Believes the beauties yet unseen are best: <br />
Swift as the wind, the damsel fled away, <br />
Nor did for these alluring speeches stay: <br />
Stay Nymph, he cry&#8217;d, I follow, not a foe. <br />
Thus from the lyon trips the trembling doe; <br />
Thus from the wolf the frighten&#8217;d lamb removes, <br />
And, from pursuing faulcons, fearful doves; <br />
Thou shunn&#8217;st a God, and shunn&#8217;st a God, that loves. <br />
Ah, lest some thorn shou&#8217;d pierce thy tender foot, <br />
Or thou shou&#8217;dst fall in flying my pursuit! <br />
To sharp uneven ways thy steps decline; <br />
Abate thy speed, and I will bate of mine. <br />
Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly; <br />
Nor basely born, nor shepherd&#8217;s swain am I. <br />
Perhaps thou know&#8217;st not my superior state; <br />
And from that ignorance proceeds thy hate. <br />
Me Claros, Delphi, Tenedos obey; <br />
These hands the Patareian scepter sway. <br />
The King of Gods begot me: what shall be, <br />
Or is, or ever was, in Fate, I see. <br />
Mine is th&#8217; invention of the charming lyre; <br />
Sweet notes, and heav&#8217;nly numbers, I inspire. <br />
Sure is my bow, unerring is my dart; <br />
But ah! more deadly his, who pierc&#8217;d my heart. <br />
Med&#8217;cine is mine; what herbs and simples grow <br />
In fields, and forrests, all their pow&#8217;rs I know; <br />
And am the great physician call&#8217;d, below. <br />
Alas that fields and forrests can afford. <br />
No remedies to heal their love-sick lord! <br />
To cure the pains of love, no plant avails: <br />
And his own physick, the physician falls.</p>
<p>She heard not half; so furiously she flies; <br />
And on her ear th&#8217; imperfect accent dies, <br />
Fear gave her wings; and as she fled, the wind <br />
Increasing, spread her flowing hair behind; <br />
And left her legs and thighs expos&#8217;d to view: <br />
Which made the God more eager to pursue. <br />
The God was young, and was too hotly bent <br />
To lose his time in empty compliment: <br />
But led by love, and fir&#8217;d with such a sight, <br />
Impetuously pursu&#8217;d his near delight.</p>
<p>As when th&#8217; impatient greyhound slipt from far, <br />
Bounds o&#8217;er the glebe to course the fearful hare, <br />
She in her speed does all her safety lay; <br />
And he with double speed pursues the prey; <br />
O&#8217;er-runs her at the sitting turn, and licks <br />
His chaps in vain, and blows upon the flix: <br />
She scapes, and for the neighb&#8217;ring covert strives, <br />
And gaining shelter, doubts if yet she lives: <br />
If little things with great we may compare, <br />
Such was the God, and such the flying fair, <br />
She urg&#8217;d by fear, her feet did swiftly move, <br />
But he more swiftly, who was urg&#8217;d by love. <br />
He gathers ground upon her in the chace: <br />
Now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace; <br />
And just is fast&#8217;ning on the wish&#8217;d embrace. <br />
The nymph grew pale, and in a mortal fright, <br />
Spent with the labour of so long a flight; <br />
And now despairing, cast a mournful look <br />
Upon the streams of her paternal brook; <br />
Oh help, she cry&#8217;d, in this extreamest need! <br />
If water Gods are deities indeed: <br />
Gape Earth, and this unhappy wretch intomb; <br />
Or change my form, whence all my sorrows come. <br />
Scarce had she finish&#8217;d, when her feet she found <br />
Benumb&#8217;d with cold, and fasten&#8217;d to the ground: <br />
A filmy rind about her body grows; <br />
Her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs: <br />
The nymph is all into a lawrel gone; <br />
The smoothness of her skin remains alone. <br />
Yet Phoebus loves her still, and casting round <br />
Her bole, his arms, some little warmth he found. <br />
The tree still panted in th&#8217; unfinish&#8217;d part: <br />
Not wholly vegetive, and heav&#8217;d her heart. <br />
He fixt his lips upon the trembling rind; <br />
It swerv&#8217;d aside, and his embrace declin&#8217;d. <br />
To whom the God, Because thou canst not be <br />
My mistress, I espouse thee for my tree: <br />
Be thou the prize of honour, and renown; <br />
The deathless poet, and the poem, crown. <br />
Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn, <br />
And, after poets, be by victors worn. <br />
Thou shalt returning Caesar&#8217;s triumph grace; <br />
When pomps shall in a long procession pass. <br />
Wreath&#8217;d on the posts before his palace wait; <br />
And be the sacred guardian of the gate. <br />
Secure from thunder, and unharm&#8217;d by Jove, <br />
Unfading as th&#8217; immortal Pow&#8217;rs above: <br />
And as the locks of Phoebus are unshorn, <br />
So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn. <br />
The grateful tree was pleas&#8217;d with what he said; <br />
And shook the shady honours of her head.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Io into a Heyfer</p>
<p>An ancient forest in Thessalia grows; <br />
Which Tempe&#8217;s pleasing valley does inclose: <br />
Through this the rapid Peneus take his course; <br />
From Pindus rolling with impetuous force; <br />
Mists from the river&#8217;s mighty fall arise: <br />
And deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies: <br />
Perpetual fogs are hanging o&#8217;er the wood; <br />
And sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood. <br />
Deep, in a rocky cave, he makes abode <br />
(A mansion proper for a mourning God). <br />
Here he gives audience; issuing out decrees <br />
To rivers, his dependant deities. <br />
On this occasion hither they resort; <br />
To pay their homage, and to make their court. <br />
All doubtful, whether to congratulate <br />
His daughter&#8217;s honour, or lament her fate. <br />
Sperchaeus, crown&#8217;d with poplar, first appears; <br />
Then old Apidanus came crown&#8217;d with years: <br />
Enipeus turbulent, Amphrysos tame; <br />
And Aeas last with lagging waters came. <br />
Then, of his kindred brooks, a num&#8217;rous throng <br />
Condole his loss; and bring their urns along. <br />
Not one was wanting of the wat&#8217;ry train, <br />
That fill&#8217;d his flood, or mingled with the main: <br />
But Inachus, who in his cave, alone, <br />
Wept not another&#8217;s losses, but his own, <br />
For his dear Io, whether stray&#8217;d, or dead, <br />
To him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed. <br />
He sought her through the world; but sought in vain; <br />
And no where finding, rather fear&#8217;d her slain.</p>
<p>Her, just returning from her father&#8217;s brook, <br />
Jove had beheld, with a desiring look: <br />
And, Oh fair daughter of the flood, he said, <br />
Worthy alone of Jove&#8217;s imperial bed, <br />
Happy whoever shall those charms possess; <br />
The king of Gods (nor is thy lover less) <br />
Invites thee to yon cooler shades; to shun <br />
The scorching rays of the meridian sun. <br />
Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove <br />
Alone, without a guide; thy guide is Jove. <br />
No puny Pow&#8217;r, but he whose high command <br />
Is unconfin&#8217;d, who rules the seas and land; <br />
And tempers thunder in his awful hand, <br />
Oh fly not: for she fled from his embrace <br />
O&#8217;er Lerna&#8217;s pastures: he pursu&#8217;d the chace <br />
Along the shades of the Lyrcaean plain; <br />
At length the God, who never asks in vain, <br />
Involv&#8217;d with vapours, imitating night, <br />
Both Air, and Earth; and then suppress&#8217;d her flight, <br />
And mingling force with love, enjoy&#8217;d the full delight. <br />
Mean-time the jealous Juno, from on high, <br />
Survey&#8217;d the fruitful fields of Arcady; <br />
And wonder&#8217;d that the mist shou&#8217;d over-run <br />
The face of day-light, and obscure the sun. <br />
No nat&#8217;ral cause she found, from brooks, or bogs, <br />
Or marshy lowlands, to produce the fogs; <br />
Then round the skies she sought for Jupiter, <br />
Her faithless husband; but no Jove was there: <br />
Suspecting now the worst, Or I, she said, <br />
Am much mistaken, or am much betray&#8217;d. <br />
With fury she precipitates her flight: <br />
Dispels the shadows of dissembled night; <br />
And to the day restores his native light. <br />
Th&#8217; Almighty Leacher, careful to prevent <br />
The consequence, foreseeing her descent, <br />
Transforms his mistress in a trice; and now <br />
In Io&#8217;s place appears a lovely cow. <br />
So sleek her skin, so faultless was her make, <br />
Ev&#8217;n Juno did unwilling pleasure take <br />
To see so fair a rival of her love; <br />
And what she was, and whence, enquir&#8217;d of Jove: <br />
Of what fair herd, and from what pedigree? <br />
The God, half caught, was forc&#8217;d upon a lye: <br />
And said she sprung from Earth. She took the word, <br />
And begg&#8217;d the beauteous heyfer of her lord. <br />
What should he do? &#8217;twas equal shame to Jove <br />
Or to relinquish, or betray his love: <br />
Yet to refuse so slight a gift, wou&#8217;d be <br />
But more t&#8217; increase his consort&#8217;s jealousie: <br />
Thus fear, and love, by turns, his heart assail&#8217;d; <br />
And stronger love had sure, at length, prevail&#8217;d: <br />
But some faint hope remain&#8217;d, his jealous queen <br />
Had not the mistress through the heyfer seen. <br />
The cautious Goddess, of her gift possest, <br />
Yet harbour&#8217;d anxious thoughts within her breast; <br />
As she who knew the falshood of her Jove; <br />
And justly fear&#8217;d some new relapse of love. <br />
Which to prevent, and to secure her care, <br />
To trusty Argus she commits the fair.</p>
<p>The head of Argus (as with stars the skies) <br />
Was compass&#8217;d round, and wore an hundred eyes. <br />
But two by turns their lids in slumber steep; <br />
The rest on duty still their station keep; <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d the total constellation sleep. <br />
Thus, ever present, to his eyes, and mind, <br />
His charge was still before him, tho&#8217; behind. <br />
In fields he suffer&#8217;d her to feed by Day, <br />
But when the setting sun to night gave way, <br />
The captive cow he summon&#8217;d with a call; <br />
And drove her back, and ty&#8217;d her to the stall. <br />
On leaves of trees, and bitter herbs she fed, <br />
Heav&#8217;n was her canopy, bare earth her bed: <br />
So hardly lodg&#8217;d, and to digest her food, <br />
She drank from troubled streams, defil&#8217;d with mud. <br />
Her woeful story fain she wou&#8217;d have told, <br />
With hands upheld, but had no hands to hold. <br />
Her head to her ungentle keeper bow&#8217;d, <br />
She strove to speak, she spoke not, but she low&#8217;d: <br />
Affrighted with the noise, she look&#8217;d around, <br />
And seem&#8217;d t&#8217; inquire the author of the sound.</p>
<p>Once on the banks where often she had play&#8217;d <br />
(Her father&#8217;s banks), she came, and there survey&#8217;d <br />
Her alter&#8217;d visage, and her branching head; <br />
And starting, from her self she wou&#8217;d have fled. <br />
Her fellow nymphs, familiar to her eyes, <br />
Beheld, but knew her not in this disguise. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Inachus himself was ignorant; <br />
And in his daughter, did his daughter want. <br />
She follow&#8217;d where her fellows went, as she <br />
Were still a partner of the company: <br />
They stroak her neck; the gentle heyfer stands, <br />
And her neck offers to their stroaking hands. <br />
Her father gave her grass; the grass she took; <br />
And lick&#8217;d his palms, and cast a piteous look; <br />
And in the language of her eyes, she spoke. <br />
She wou&#8217;d have told her name, and ask&#8217;d relief, <br />
But wanting words, in tears she tells her grief. <br />
Which, with her foot she makes him understand; <br />
And prints the name of Io in the sand.</p>
<p>Ah wretched me! her mournful father cry&#8217;d; <br />
She, with a sigh, to wretched me reply&#8217;d: <br />
About her milk-white neck, his arms he threw; <br />
And wept, and then these tender words ensue. <br />
And art thou she, whom I have sought around <br />
The world, and have at length so sadly found? <br />
So found, is worse than lost: with mutual words <br />
Thou answer&#8217;st not, no voice thy tongue affords: <br />
But sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast; <br />
And speech deny&#8217;d, by lowing is express&#8217;d. <br />
Unknowing, I prepar&#8217;d thy bridal bed; <br />
With empty hopes of happy issue fed. <br />
But now the husband of a herd must be <br />
Thy mate, and bell&#8217;wing sons thy progeny. <br />
Oh, were I mortal, death might bring relief: <br />
But now my God-head but extends my grief: <br />
Prolongs my woes, of which no end I see, <br />
And makes me curse my immortality! <br />
More had he said, but fearful of her stay, <br />
The starry guardian drove his charge away, <br />
To some fresh pasture; on a hilly height <br />
He sate himself, and kept her still in sight.</p>
<p>The Eyes of Argus transform&#8217;d into a Peacock&#8217;s Train</p>
<p>Now Jove no longer cou&#8217;d her suff&#8217;rings bear; <br />
But call&#8217;d in haste his airy messenger, <br />
The son of Maia, with severe decree <br />
To kill the keeper, and to set her free. <br />
With all his harness soon the God was sped, <br />
His flying hat was fastned on his head, <br />
Wings on his heels were hung, and in his hand <br />
He holds the vertue of the snaky wand. <br />
The liquid air his moving pinions wound, <br />
And, in the moment, shoot him on the ground. <br />
Before he came in sight, the crafty God <br />
His wings dismiss&#8217;d, but still retain&#8217;d his rod: <br />
That sleep-procuring wand wise Hermes took, <br />
But made it seem to sight a sherpherd&#8217;s hook. <br />
With this, he did a herd of goats controul; <br />
Which by the way he met, and slily stole. <br />
Clad like a country swain, he pip&#8217;d, and sung; <br />
And playing, drove his jolly troop along.</p>
<p>With pleasure, Argus the musician heeds; <br />
But wonders much at those new vocal reeds. <br />
And whosoe&#8217;er thou art, my friend, said he, <br />
Up hither drive thy goats, and play by me: <br />
This hill has browz for them, and shade for thee. <br />
The God, who was with ease induc&#8217;d to climb, <br />
Began discourse to pass away the time; <br />
And still betwixt, his tuneful pipe he plies; <br />
And watch&#8217;d his hour, to close the keeper&#8217;s eyes. <br />
With much ado, he partly kept awake; <br />
Not suff&#8217;ring all his eyes repose to take: <br />
And ask&#8217;d the stranger, who did reeds invent, <br />
And whence began so rare an instrument?</p>
<p>The Transformation of Syrinx into Reeds</p>
<p>Then Hermes thus: A nymph of late there was <br />
Whose heav&#8217;nly form her fellows did surpass. <br />
The pride and joy of fair Arcadia&#8217;s plains, <br />
Belov&#8217;d by deities, ador&#8217;d by swains: <br />
Syrinx her name, by Sylvans oft pursu&#8217;d, <br />
As oft she did the lustful Gods delude: <br />
The rural, and the woodland Pow&#8217;rs disdain&#8217;d; <br />
With Cynthia hunted, and her rites maintain&#8217;d: <br />
Like Phoebe clad, even Phoebe&#8217;s self she seems, <br />
So tall, so streight, such well-proportion&#8217;d limbs: <br />
The nicest eye did no distinction know, <br />
But that the goddess bore a golden bow: <br />
Distinguish&#8217;d thus, the sight she cheated too. <br />
Descending from Lycaeus, Pan admires <br />
The matchless nymph, and burns with new desires. <br />
A crown of pine upon his head he wore; <br />
And thus began her pity to implore. <br />
But e&#8217;er he thus began, she took her flight <br />
So swift, she was already out of sight. <br />
Nor stay&#8217;d to hear the courtship of the God; <br />
But bent her course to Ladon&#8217;s gentle flood: <br />
There by the river stopt, and tir&#8217;d before; <br />
Relief from water nymphs her pray&#8217;rs implore.</p>
<p>Now while the lustful God, with speedy pace, <br />
Just thought to strain her in a strict embrace, <br />
He fill&#8217;d his arms with reeds, new rising on the place. <br />
And while he sighs, his ill success to find, <br />
The tender canes were shaken by the wind; <br />
And breath&#8217;d a mournful air, unheard before; <br />
That much surprizing Pan, yet pleas&#8217;d him more. <br />
Admiring this new musick, Thou, he said, <br />
Who canst not be the partner of my bed, <br />
At least shall be the confort of my mind: <br />
And often, often to my lips be joyn&#8217;d. <br />
He form&#8217;d the reeds, proportion&#8217;d as they are, <br />
Unequal in their length, and wax&#8217;d with care, <br />
They still retain the name of his ungrateful fair.</p>
<p>While Hermes pip&#8217;d, and sung, and told his tale, <br />
The keeper&#8217;s winking eyes began to fail, <br />
And drowsie slumber on the lids to creep; <br />
&#8216;Till all the watchman was at length asleep. <br />
Then soon the God his voice, and song supprest; <br />
And with his pow&#8217;rful rod confirm&#8217;d his rest: <br />
Without delay his crooked faulchion drew, <br />
And at one fatal stroke the keeper slew. <br />
Down from the rock fell the dissever&#8217;d head, <br />
Opening its eyes in death; and falling, bled; <br />
And mark&#8217;d the passage with a crimson trail: <br />
Thus Argus lies in pieces, cold, and pale; <br />
And all his hundred eyes, with all their light, <br />
Are clos&#8217;d at once, in one perpetual night. <br />
These Juno takes, that they no more may fail, <br />
And spreads them in her peacock&#8217;s gaudy tail.</p>
<p>Impatient to revenge her injur&#8217;d bed, <br />
She wreaks her anger on her rival&#8217;s head; <br />
With Furies frights her from her native home; <br />
And drives her gadding, round the world to roam: <br />
Nor ceas&#8217;d her madness, and her flight, before <br />
She touch&#8217;d the limits of the Pharian shore. <br />
At length, arriving on the banks of Nile, <br />
Wearied with length of ways, and worn with toil, <br />
She laid her down; and leaning on her knees, <br />
Invok&#8217;d the cause of all her miseries: <br />
And cast her languishing regards above, <br />
For help from Heav&#8217;n, and her ungrateful Jove. <br />
She sigh&#8217;d, she wept, she low&#8217;d; &#8217;twas all she cou&#8217;d; <br />
And with unkindness seem&#8217;d to tax the God. <br />
Last, with an humble pray&#8217;r, she beg&#8217;d repose, <br />
Or death at least, to finish all her woes. <br />
Jove heard her vows, and with a flatt&#8217;ring look, <br />
In her behalf to jealous Juno spoke, <br />
He cast his arms about her neck, and said, <br />
Dame, rest secure; no more thy nuptial bed <br />
This nymph shall violate; by Styx I swear, <br />
And every oath that binds the Thunderer. <br />
The Goddess was appeas&#8217;d; and at the word <br />
Was Io to her former shape restor&#8217;d. <br />
The rugged hair began to fall away; <br />
The sweetness of her eyes did only stay, <br />
Tho&#8217; not so large; her crooked horns decrease; <br />
The wideness of her jaws and nostrils cease: <br />
Her hoofs to hands return, in little space: <br />
The five long taper fingers take their place, <br />
And nothing of the heyfer now is seen, <br />
Beside the native whiteness of the skin. <br />
Erected on her feet she walks again: <br />
And two the duty of the four sustain. <br />
She tries her tongue; her silence softly breaks, <br />
And fears her former lowings when she speaks: <br />
A Goddess now, through all th&#8217; Aegyptian State: <br />
And serv&#8217;d by priests, who in white linnen wait.</p>
<p>Her son was Epaphus, at length believ&#8217;d <br />
The son of Jove, and as a God receiv&#8217;d; <br />
With sacrifice ador&#8217;d, and publick pray&#8217;rs, <br />
He common temples with his mother shares. <br />
Equal in years, and rival in renown <br />
With Epaphus, the youthful Phaeton <br />
Like honour claims; and boasts his sire the sun. <br />
His haughty looks, and his assuming air, <br />
The son of Isis could no longer bear: <br />
Thou tak&#8217;st thy mother&#8217;s word too far, said he, <br />
And hast usurp&#8217;d thy boasted pedigree. <br />
Go, base pretender to a borrow&#8217;d name. <br />
Thus tax&#8217;d, he blush&#8217;d with anger, and with shame; <br />
But shame repress&#8217;d his rage: the daunted youth <br />
Soon seeks his mother, and enquires the truth: <br />
Mother, said he, this infamy was thrown <br />
By Epaphus on you, and me your son. <br />
He spoke in publick, told it to my face; <br />
Nor durst I vindicate the dire disgrace: <br />
Even I, the bold, the sensible of wrong, <br />
Restrain&#8217;d by shame, was forc&#8217;d to hold my tongue. <br />
To hear an open slander, is a curse: <br />
But not to find an answer, is a worse. <br />
If I am Heav&#8217;n-begot, assert your son <br />
By some sure sign; and make my father known, <br />
To right my honour, and redeem your own. <br />
He said, and saying cast his arms about <br />
Her neck, and beg&#8217;d her to resolve the doubt.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tis hard to judge if Clymene were mov&#8217;d <br />
More by his pray&#8217;r, whom she so dearly lov&#8217;d, <br />
Or more with fury fir&#8217;d, to find her name <br />
Traduc&#8217;d, and made the sport of common fame. <br />
She stretch&#8217;d her arms to Heav&#8217;n, and fix&#8217;d her eyes <br />
On that fair planet that adorns the skies; <br />
Now by those beams, said she, whose holy fires <br />
Consume my breast, and kindle my desires; <br />
By him, who sees us both, and clears our sight, <br />
By him, the publick minister of light, <br />
I swear that Sun begot thee; if I lye, <br />
Let him his chearful influence deny: <br />
Let him no more this perjur&#8217;d creature see; <br />
And shine on all the world but only me. <br />
If still you doubt your mother&#8217;s innocence, <br />
His eastern mansion is not far from hence; <br />
With little pains you to his Leve go, <br />
And from himself your parentage may know. <br />
With joy th&#8217; ambitious youth his mother heard, <br />
And eager, for the journey soon prepar&#8217;d. <br />
He longs the world beneath him to survey; <br />
To guide the chariot; and to give the day: <br />
From Meroe&#8217;s burning sands he bends his course, <br />
Nor less in India feels his father&#8217;s force: <br />
His travel urging, till he came in sight; <br />
And saw the palace by the purple light.</p>
