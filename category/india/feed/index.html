				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Dr. Vidagdha Bennett</em></p>
<p>Most tourists arrive in Kolkata clutching the latest guidebook to India as if it were a lifeline tossed in a stormy and troubled sea. The 2007 edition from Lonely Planet, to take one popular example, is reassuringly crammed with well-researched facts on all the practical aspects of travelling in the sub-continent. The section on Kolkata prescribes exactly what to do, where to stay according to your budget, places to eat – and how to exit the city rapidly once you have exhausted the slender range of options that are listed. In practice, I found that this tome is, without doubt, a compendium of vital information should you happen to be a ‘casual’ traveller, someone who is just passing through the city on the way to, say, Darjeeling or Varanasi, someone who wants to skim the surface and cross Kolkata off the list of 100 places you hoped to see before you die.</p>
<p><span id="more-19040"></span></p>
<p>But I was not. Kolkata has been such a rich and vibrant presence in my imagination for more than thirty years that my first trip to this cradle of spirituality, literature, music and art had become more a pilgrimage than an excursion. For me, Kolkata was not on the way to anywhere; it was a destination in itself. Having sacrificed valuable space in my suitcase for the whopping 1,236-page, one kilo Lonely Planet doorstopper, I consulted it religiously in the first instance to find somewhere decent and economical to stay. From its excellent maps, I memorised the basic layout of the streets. Then, a few days later, I sold it to a second-hand bookstore and launched into life beyond its carefully regimented scope.</p>
<p>After a month of exploring the city on my own, my experiences have led me to believe that Kolkata is one of those great destinations in the world that warrant a vastly different approach to tourism. To me, the worst aspects of our Western attitude to travel are summed up by Sir Edmund Hillary’s statement after he became the first person to summit Mount Everest: “We knocked the bastard off,” he declared when he arrived back at base camp with Tenzing after their victorious ascent of the world’s highest peak on May 29th, 1953.</p>
<p>Hillary had climbed the holy mountain Chomolungma, “Mother Goddess of the Universe”, whose snowy slopes no Tibetan or Nepali had previously dared to desecrate. Even now, sherpas perform elaborate pujas to ask for the blessings of the mountain before starting out on an expedition. At every step of the way, they invoke her compassion. To Hillary, this sense of the sacred, this devotion, this reverence for a mere mountain – an upsurge of marine limestone caused by a collision of the earth’s tectonic plates – was so much baloney. In fact, his dismissal of these deeply ingrained beliefs was so absolute that he used language which to the Indian, Nepali and Tibetan cultures contained the most abusive of all references, language which, in truth, shamed our Western culture. And even now, fifty-five years on, his attitude is reproduced in the phraseology of those travellers who boast that they have “done India” or some other remote and exotic locale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the current trend in guidebooks reinforces this soulless approach. We have only to look at the pressurised way in which information is gathered to ascertain their priorities. Tony Wheeler, co-founder with his wife Maureen of Lonely Planet, somewhat disturbingly describes his company’s research process in his book “Once While Travelling: The Lonely Planet Story” (Viking: 2005):</p>
<p><em>“Guidebooks are perishable commodities; the information quickly dates, so once you start work you must push through to the end as rapidly as you can. As a result, guidebooks are researched at breakneck pace. There’s no time to sit around and soak up the atmosphere…” </em><br />
<em>(p. 243)</em></p>
<p>In other words, no time to ‘see’, only to look. Fortunately, there has always been another kind of traveller, a traveller for whom logging countless miles to look at something is not enough. For these travellers, each journey is born of a purpose – it is a search for meaning, an act of devotion. Phil Cousineau, in his wonderful book “The Art of Pilgrimage” (Conari Press: 1998) writes:</p>
<p><em>“For millennia, this cry in the heart for embarking upon a meaningful journey has been answered by pilgrimage, a transformative journey to a sacred centre. It calls for a journey to a holy site associated with gods, saints, or heroes, or to a natural setting imbued with spiritual power, or to a revered temple to seek counsel.” (xxiii)</em></p>
<p>And spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy assures us:</p>
<p><em>Humanity’s</em><br />
<em>          Pilgrim-sunrise-days</em><br />
<em>          Shall forever last.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, what defines a pilgrim is the ability to be moved by something, to respond with heart and soul, to cross that invisible divide between past and present, so that the past lives and breathes vividly and intensely. It is our receptivity to the dreams and aspirations of the past, our urge to experience life through the eyes of a saint or a genius or a hero. This is the hope we carry in our hearts when we imbue our journey with an element of the sacred. And we risk all, offer all, pass through endless difficulties and trials to fulfil it.</p>
<p>Equally, we may start out as tourists and be so swept away by the power of a place that our journey is quite unexpectedly transformed into a pilgrimage and we find ourselves returning to that place or object over and over in our imagination.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, what is required of a tourist, other than the means to travel? He may derive pleasure from his adventures, but he is not required to give of himself or be touched in any way by what he sees.<br />
He remains a foreigner, a bystander, someone who chooses to maintain a degree of separation from what he has journeyed so far to gaze at.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy expresses this difference between soulless and soulful travel in an imagined conversation between man and God:</p>
<p><em>“Father, I love to travel.”</em><br />
<em>                    “Son, I travel to love.”</em></p>
<p>Even if they acknowledge the large numbers of pilgrims moving invisibly around the world, how can the directors of guidebooks possibly adjust what has become an internationally successful publishing formula? How can guidebooks be re-invented to meet the needs of today’s pilgrim-travellers?</p>
<p>I believe that guidebooks would benefit by focussing on what endures, rather than what changes, and by recognising that it is more important to inspire than to inform. Imagine coming across a slim volume called “The Kolkata Guidebook for Writers”. Perhaps it would contain detailed maps of Kolkata showing the homes of Rabindranath Tagore, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Vidyasagar, Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, D.L. Roy, Jibananda Das and a host of others. Perhaps it could show the precise place in Sudder Street where Tagore wrote his immortal poem “The Awakening of the Fountain.” It would describe where to find the gravesite of Michael Madhusudan Dutt with its deeply moving epitaph:</p>
<p><em>“Stop a while, traveller!</em><br />
<em>          Should Mother Bengal claim thee for her son.</em><br />
<em>          As a child takes repose on his mother’s</em><br />
<em>                    Elysian lap,</em><br />
<em>          Even so, here in the Long Home,</em><br />
<em>          On the bosom of the earth,</em><br />
<em>          Enjoys the sweet eternal sleep</em><br />
<em>          Poet Madhusudan of the Duttas.”</em></p>
<p>(Translated into English by Sri Chinmoy)</p>
<p>My Kolkata Guidebook for Writers would include directions to the cell in Alipore Jail where the great spiritual leader and epic poet Sri Aurobindo was interned on charges of sedition in 1908. The book would also showcase the works of contemporary Bengali writers, such as Sankar, Amitav Ghose and Buddhadev Bose. It would detail the history and development of College Street and the Kolkata Book Fair, list the major bookstores and publishers, give directions to the favourite hang-outs of Bengali writers, perhaps include a section on where visiting writers could submit their articles and poems for publication, where they could participate in readings or find translation services.</p>
<p>I would offer separate guidebooks for lovers of music, art and film, for spiritual seekers, for students of architecture and photography, for gourmets wishing to acquire or merely taste the delights of authentic Bengali cooking, for those who would like to explore the city on foot or bicycle, for those who yearn to serve on a volunteer basis at Mother Teresa’s homes or similar foundations, for those wishing to stay and work in Kolkata, for sports fans, for shoppers, for scholars and researchers, and, finally, for those interested in tracing the footsteps of Bengal’s heroic freedom-fighters.</p>
<p>In short, I would offer a plethora of in-depth specialist guidebooks, preferably written by Bengalis, for this most fascinating of all cities. True, they would forfeit all pretence at being comprehensive. But perhaps they would achieve something far more important: perhaps they would evoke an imaginative and inspired response in the minds and hearts of travellers.</p>

<p ><strong>Arjuna:</strong></p>
<p>   Tell me of the man who lives in wisdom,<br />
   Ever aware of the Self, O Krishna;<br />
   How does he talk, how sit, how move about?</p>
<p>   <strong>Sri Krishna:</strong></p>
<p>   He lives in wisdom<br />
   Who sees himself in all and all in him,<br />
   Whose love for the Lord of Love has consumed<br />
   Every selfish desire and sense-craving<br />
   Tormenting the heart. Not agitated<br />
   By grief nor hankering after pleasure,<br />
   He lives free from lust and fear and anger<br />
   Fettered no more by selfish attachments,<br />
   He is not elated by good fortune<br />
   Nor depressed by bad. Such is the seer.</p>
<p>   Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs<br />
   The sage can draw in his senses at will.<br />
   An aspirant abstains from sense-pleasures,<br />
   But he still craves for them. These cravings all<br />
   Disappear when he sees the Lord of Love.<br />
   For even of one who treads the path<br />
   The stormy senses can sweep off the mind.<br />
   But he lives in wisdom who subdues them,<br />
  And keeps his mind ever absorbed in me.</p>

<p>Akbar the Great Moghul emperor ruled Northern India from 1556 to 1605. He was a great leader, warrior, hunter, a lover of nature and the arts, expert sportsman and philosopher. Akbar was a multifaceted man &#8211; a master of all arts, yet one of his most revered qualities and greatest legacies was his great love for and practice of religious tolerance. Viewed in the context of the era in which Akbar lived this is all the more astonishing and impressive. In a time where wars constantly waged in the name of religion, prejudice was rife in many parts of the world and would remain so for hundreds of years, Akbar practiced an unprecedented kindness, compassion and reverence for many religious other than his own Muslim faith.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="/authors/akbar">Akbar</a> ruled Hindus, Muslims, Zoroastrians, and Jains, members of which were all treated equally under his philosophy of sulahkul or &quot;universal tolerance. With Akbar as their ruler, for the first time in their history India had a Muslim leader who not only tolerated the many other religions, but actively sought out their guidance and wisdom.</p>
<p>One of the first of Akbar&#8217;s actions that endeared him to the Hindu population was his abolition of two fiercely resented taxes. The first tax was on all Hindu pilgrims when they visited their shrines, the second tax was the jizya &#8211; a severe tax on all non muslims. The abolition of these two taxes were greatly appreciated by Akbars Hindu subjects and lent strength to his rule.</p>
<p>Akbar unified India as no other ruler had done before. He secured allegiance from the Rajput emperor of Amber by marrying his daughter thus making him a powerful ally. His new wife who was given the revered title Maryam az-Zamani was allowed to practice her own religion, this was a first time a Hindu woman was allowed to worship freely in a Muslim harem and it set a precedent. From that day forward all Hindu women within the harem were free to follow their own faith.</p>
<p>In 1575 Akbar created the Ibadatkhana, the House of Worship, as a place of religious debate and dialogue. Wise men of all religions were invited to come to the Ibadatkhana on Friday nights to discuss religion and philosophy. After presiding over many of these discussions Akbar became more and more convinced of the value and righteousness of all religions, he felt confined by the narrow limits of one religion and sought more spiritual answers from Hinduism. He adopted many of their customs, he fasted regularly, abstained from meat, visited the holy places that Hindu&#8217;s worshipped, he drank the holy water from the river Ganges and sought advice from Hindu sages and holy men.</p>
<p>Akbar also invited Catholic priests from Goa to his palace to enlighten him on Christianity and the words of the Christ. When they presented him with their gift &#8211; Europe&#8217;s newest and most lavish printed edition of the Bible, a seven-volume set with many illustrations. Akbar prayerfully kissed each volume, and then touched each one to his head.</p>
<p>Akbar sought to unite all his subjects no matter their creed or faith. He accomplished this enormous feat and as a result his kingdom flourished. Akbar was revered and loved by his subjects and is remembered as India&#8217;s greatest ruler.</p>

<p>In an essay written in 1918 and entitled The Renaissance in India, Sri Aurobindo presents us with a masterly view of India&#8217;s culture through the ages &#8212; her essential spirit and her characteristic soul, her unique genius and powers which gave her her remarkably long periods of greatness and an unusually prolific creativity &#8212; that which allowed her to survive for so long when other ancient civilisations faded away.

<p>Quite an interesting story, a little outdated now but still worth mentioning.</p>
<p>A young boy by the name of Ram Bomjan decided to meditate under a tree continuously for several months. His followers claimed that during this time he didn&#8217;t take any food or water. When his activities were observed by a Nepalese government team who gained permission to observe the boy continually for 48 hours. They found that to their amazement, he did remain rigid and focused in meditation.</p>
<p>Back in March he disappeared, perhaps because of all the interest he was receiving. Many locals believe he has gone to meditate in peace away from the glare of the media spotlight.</p>
<p>I feel the boy is genuine. That does not necessarily mean he is a reincarnation of the Buddha. But he seems an advanced soul who has practised meditation sincerly before. Whether he is eating or not. It is worth noting there are not many 16 year old boys who can still still motionless for 10 minutes. Let alone practically all day. His parents say as a young boy he had a particular strong sense of compassion for living creatures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very interesting article in business week. Modern business leaders are increasingly looking to the wisdom of India for practical solutions to creating a successful business. There is a growing realisation that a successful business does not have to compromise its principles. In fact an &quot;ethical&quot; business which seeks to promote the well being of its workers and consumers can actually be a very successful business model.</p>
<p>&quot; THE ANCIENT SPIRITUAL wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita seems at first like an odd choice for guiding today&#8217;s numbers-driven managers. Also known as Song of the Divine One, the work relates a conversation between the supreme deity Krishna and Arjuna, a warrior prince struggling with a moral crisis before a crucial battle. One key message is that enlightened leaders should master any impulses or emotions that cloud sound judgment. Good leaders are selfless, take initiative, and focus on their duty rather than obsessing over outcomes or financial gain. &quot;The key point,&quot; says Ram Charan, a coach to CEOs such as General Electric Co.&#8217;s (GE) Jeffrey R. Immelt, &quot;is to put purpose before self. This is absolutely applicable to corporate leadership today.&quot;</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

<p>From : Akbar&#8217;s Secret visit to Mirabai</p>
<p>&quot;Although Akbar was a Muslim, he liked the Hindu spirituality and culture immensely.   At his court, he retained all kinds of talented and extraordinary people from   various religions. Akbar always appreciated others&#8217; good qualities. In the course   of time, he came to hear about Mirabai, the great devotee of Lord Krishna. The   bhajans that she sang became known throughout the length and breadth of India.   Akbar decided to go and see her for himself. </p>
<p>At first, it seemed impossible for the Emperor to fulfil his wish. Mirabai     was married to Prince Bhoja Raj of Chittor. This family and the Moghul Emperors     had always been the worst of enemies! If Akbar went to see Mirabai, he would     be risking his life and he would also be placing Mirabai herself in great danger.     But Akbar was determined to go. He said, &quot;I will not go as the Emperor     with my army. I will go in disguise.&quot;</p>
