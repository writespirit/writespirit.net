<h3>Quotes by P.Yogananda</h3>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p > &#8220;Let my soul smile through my heart <br />
  and my heart smile through my eyes,<br /> <br />
  that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&#8220;Many people excuse their own faults <br />
   but judge other persons harshly.<br /> <br />
  We  should reverse this attitude <br />
  by excusing others&#8217; shortcomings and by  harshly examining our own.&#8221;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&#8220;There is a magnet in your heart that will attract  true friends. <br />
  That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first.  <br />
  When you learn to live for others, they will live for you.&#8221; </p>

<h2>Quotes by Yogananda </h2>
<p>  &#8216;To meditate truly is to concentrate solely on spirit. This is  esoteric meditation. It is the highest form of activity that man  can perform,  and it is the most balanced way to find GOD.&#8217; </p>
<p> &#8216;Every day undertake something that is difficult for you and try  to do it. Though you fail 5 times, keep on, and as soon as you have  succeeded in that direction, apply your concentrated will on  something else. You will thus be able to accomplish increasingly  greater things. Will is the instrument of the image of God  within you.&#8217; </p>
<p>
&#8216;HE who is persistent will realize God. So try your best to make meditation a regular experience in your life.&#8217; </p>
<p>&#8216;TO be able to concentrate is essential for spiritual progress; without concentration you shall never find God.                Learn how to shut out of your consciousness all sounds and other earthly distractions.&#8217; </p>

<p>&quot;Affirm divine calmness and peace, and send out only thoughts  of love and goodwill if you want to live in peace and harmony. Never get angry,  for anger poisons your system. Try to understand people who cross you, and  whenever anybody tries to inflame you, mentally say: &ldquo;I am too comfortable to  be angry. I don&rsquo;t want to be sick with anger.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&quot;To be calmly active and actively calm &ndash; a Prince of Peace  sitting on the throne of poise, directing the kingdom of activity &ndash; is to be  spiritually healthy. Too much activity &ndash; is to be spiritually healthy. Too much  activitiy makes one an automation and too much calmness makes one lazy and  impractical. Peace is the enjoyment of life; activity is the expression of  life. A balance between the activity of the West and the calmness of the East  is needed.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;As you find your soul-reservoir of peace, less and less  controversy will be able to afflict your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If your husband or wife gets angry and rouses your ire, take  a little walk and cool off before responding. If he or she speaks sharply, don&rsquo;t  retort in the same way. It is better to remain quite until the temper has  cooled down&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Never let anyone rob you of your peace; and don not  steal away the peace of others by your verbal misbehavior&hellip;<br />
