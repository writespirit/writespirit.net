<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;A man began to sink a well, but having dug down to the depth of twenty cubits he could not find the least trace of the water-spring which was to feed his well. So he desisted from the work and selected another place for the purpose. There he dug deeper than before, but even then he could not find any water. So again he selected another spot and dug still deeper than before, but it was also of no avail. At last in utter disgust he gave up the task altogether. The sum total of the depths of these three wells was little short of a hundred cubits. Had he had the patience to devote even a half of the whole of this labour to his first well, without shifting the site of the well from place to place, he would surely have been successful in getting water. Such is the case with men who continually shift their positions in regard to faith. In order to meet with success we should devote ourselves entirely to a single object of faith, without being doubtful as to its efficacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Savitri answered to almighty Death:<br />
&#8220;O dark-browed sophist of the universe<br />
Who veilst the Real with its own Idea,<br />
Hiding with brute objects Nature&#8217;s living face,<br />
Masking eternity with thy dance of death,<br />
Thou hast woven the ignorant mind into a screen<br />
And made of Thought error&#8217;s purveyor and scribe,<br />
And a false witness of mind&#8217;s servant sense.<br />
An aesthete of the sorrow of the world,<br />
Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy<br />
Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light<br />
And called in Truth to vindicate a lie.<br />
A lying reality is falsehood&#8217;s crown<br />
And a perverted truth her richest gem.<br />
O Death, thou speakest truth but truth that slays,<br />
I answer to thee with the Truth that saves.<br />
A traveller new-discovering himself,<br />
One made of Matter&#8217;s world his starting-point,<br />
He made of Nothingness his living-room<br />
And Night a process of the eternal light<br />
And death a spur towards immortality.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo,</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Q</i>. Why do you not lead a family life with your wife?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>A</i>. The God Kârtikeya, the leader of the Heavenly army, once happened to scratch a cat with his nail. On going home he saw there was the mark of a scratch on the cheek of his Mother. Seeing this, he asked of her, &#8216;Mother, dear, how have you got that ugly scratch on your cheek?&#8217; The Goddess Durgâ replied, &#8216;Child, this is thy own handiwork,&#8211;the mark scratched by thy own nail.&#8217; Kârtikeya asked in wonder, &#8216;Mother, how is it? I never remember to have scratched thee!&#8217; The Mother replied, &#8216;Darling, hast thou forgotten having scratched a cat this morning?&#8217;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Kârtikeya said, &#8216;Yes, I did scratch a cat; but how did your cheek get marked?&#8217; The Mother replied, &#8216;Dear child, nothing exists in this world but myself. I am all creation. Whomsoever thou hurtest, thou hurtest me.&#8217; Kârtikeya was greatly surprised at this, and determined thenceforward never to marry; for whom would he marry? Every woman was mother to him. I am like Kârtikeya. I consider every woman as my Divine Mother.</p>

<p>The light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright:<br />
The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love’s detachment beats the time.<br />
Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kabîr says<br />
“My Beloved One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky.”</p>
<p>Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?<br />
Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and night,<br />
There are the hidden banner and the secret canopy:<br />
There the sound of the unseen bells is heard.<br />
Kabîr says: “There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the Universe sitteth on His throne.”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;A man sitting under the shade of the Kalpa-v<i>ri</i>ksha (wishing-tree) wished to be a king, and in an instant he was a king. The next moment he wished to have a charming damsel, and the damsel was instantly by his side. The man then thought within himself, if a tiger came and devoured him, and alas! in an instant he was in the jaws of a tiger! God is like that wishing-tree: whosoever in His presence thinks that he is destitute and poor, remains as such, but he who thinks and believes that the Lord fulfils all his wants, receives everything from Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be capable of silence, stillness, illuminated passivity is to be fit for immortality <em>—amr.tatv ¯aya kalpate</em>.</p>
<p>It is to be dh¯ıra, the ideal of our ancient civilisation, which does not mean to be tamasic, inert and a block. The inaction of the tamasic man is a stumbling-block to the energies around him, the inaction of the Yogin creates, preserves and destroys; his action is dynamic with the direct, stupendous driving-power of great natural forces. It is a stillness within often covered by a ripple of talk and activity without,—the oceanwith its lively surface of waves. But even as men do not see the reality of God’s workings from the superficial noise of the world and its passing events, for they are hidden beneath that cover, so also shall they fail to understand the action of the Yogin, for he is different within from what he is outside.</p>
<p>The strength of noise and activity is, doubtless, great,—did not the walls of Jericho fall by the force of noise? But infinite is the strength of the stillness and the silence, in which great forces prepare for action.&#8221;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties – this knowledge, this feeling … that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.&#8221;</p>

Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night<br />

Like nature&#8217;s patient, sleepless Eremite,<br />

Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask<br />
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors&#8211;<br />
No&#8211;yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,<br />
Pillow&#8217;d upon my fair love&#8217;s ripening breast,<br />
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,<br />
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,<br />
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,<br />
And so live ever&#8211;or else swoon to death.</p>
