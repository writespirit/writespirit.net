<p><strong>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</strong></p>
<p>The Gospel of Sri Ramkrishna tells of the unique life and teachings of spiritual Master, Sri Ramakrishna. <a class="reference" href="/authors/sri_ramakrishna">Sri Ramakrishna</a> who was born in a simple Indian village and received little in the way of formal education. However, from an early age he felt, with great intensity, a desire to see God. Throughout the book we are constantly reminded of the pure devotion inherent in the life and spirit of Sri Ramakrishna. Frequently we become aware of the mystical ecstasy&#8217;s Ramakrishna would repeatedly enjoy. To the credit of the author M, we feel a glimpse of this devotional consciousness; the book is far more than just dry words, describing facts and theories. Any spiritual seeker can derive great inspiration from this book. In particular it will encourage us to pursue the direct path of love, devotion and surrender.</p>

<p><strong>Swami Vivekananda a biography by Swami Nikhilananda.</strong></p>
<p>If Sri Ramakrishna was the source of mystical knowledge, Vivekandana, was his faithful disciple who strove to manifest his Master&#8217;s light. Vivekananda was not just a saint and liberated Soul, he felt the necessity of awakening his fellow man from ignorance, leading them to their own liberation. Throughout this well written biography we become aware of Vivekananda&#8217;s spiritual depth and also his desire to serve others selflessly. Through this biography the indomitable spirit of Vivekananda is clearly shown. It is not possible to read this book without being infused with some of Vivekananda&#8217;s remarkable spirit: &quot;Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowlska &#8211; Divine Mercy in My Soul</strong></p>
<p>The diary of saint Maria Kowalska gives a revealing insight into a contemporary Christian Saint. The depth of her devotion and obedience is both revealing and inspiring.</p>
<p>During her brief life on earth she lived as a humble nun, unknown to the outside world. The remarkable feature of her life was her inner life and connection to her spiritual guide Jesus Christ. She explains in simple and clear language the divine grace and blessings that she frequently experienced. Because she had such a deep inner connection to the source of divine consciousness, she could willingly and happily submit to the many trials, humiliations and sufferings that came her way. The power of the book makes you realise that if we can discover the divine within, there is nothing that you cannot face in the outer world. Although she died in obscurity in 1938, her writings led Pope John Paul II to hail her as &quot;the great apostle of Divine Mercy in our time.&quot;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are some of my personal favorite spiritual books. This list is far from exhaustive, but, it is just a few good suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>A Search In Secret India. by Paul Brunton</strong></p>
<p>One always retains a certain affection for the book which gives you a real thirst for the spiritual life. It was the concluding chapter in &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot; by, Paul Brunton, that awoke a real longing for me to try meditation. The book tells of the various adventures and experiences of Paul Brunton, as he travels through India.Throughout the book we are introduced to a variety of exotic fakirs, saints, astrologers and charlatans. But, it is amidst his various journey&#8217;s and travels we get a real glimpse of the ancient spirituality of India. In particular, his visit to Arunachala and the great Sage, Ramana Maharshi, really stick in the mind. It is on the holy mountain of Arunachala that Paul Brunton experiences a state of advanced meditation. Much to the credit of the writer, he is able to convey at least a glimpse of this marvelous experience. Most importantly it awakens in the aspirant the feeling that this is something we can experience ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Autobiography of a Yogi. by Paramhansa Yogananda</strong></p>
<p>For many &quot;autobiography of a yogi&quot; has opened up a whole new world of yoga, spiritual masters and Saints. Many concepts in the book are, to a westerner, far removed from our conventional education. Yet, Yogananda writes with such a potent spiritual force that great spiritual feats and experiences feel like a natural occurrence. It is hard, if not impossible, to express experiences of super-consciousness, but through Yogananda we get a memorable insight into the life and viewpoint of a real yogi. Rightly a spiritual classic, the autobiography of a yogi really captures the imagination.</p>
<p>Initiation by Elizabeth Haisch.</p>
<p>Initiation is a fascinating insight into the struggles and spiritual memories of Elizabeth Haisch. We are given a revealing insight into the spirituality of Ancient Egypt, through her memories and experiences we realise the possibilities of reincarnation and self realisation. A treasure of juicy information about reincarnation, but also a book that inspires us to live the spiritual life yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Savitri by Sri Aurobindo</strong></p>
<p>I have not read even 20% of Savitri, sometimes I read it and I fail to grasp its sublime meaning. Yet, despite my failure to read it in its entirety, it maintains a powerful pull. Some verses stand out, even just a few lines are quite often sufficient to take us to a realm of poetic delight. Savitri gives a unique and unprecedented understanding of profound spiritual truths. Certain chapters I have bookmarked for frequent rereading. In particular, the conversation between <a class="reference" href="/spiritual_poets/sri_aurobindo_poetry/savitri/my-god-is-love/">Death and Savitri</a>, to me give a quite remarkable view of spiritual evolution and the mystery of life and death. Perhaps, Savitri is far ahead of its time. But to delve into the world of Savitri is like delving into the meditation of a realised Spiritual Master.</p>
<p>Savitri by Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Within. by Sri Chinmoy</strong></p>
<p>Books on spiritual knowledge are numerous, but to read spiritual advice, whilst feeling the illumination of a real spiritual master are rare. The mark of true spiritual writing is not just the words, but the consciousness with which they embody. Through a unique, concise style, Sri Chinmoy highlights spiritual ideals with a mixture of poetry, prose and aphorism. In fact, at times the prose is like poetry. It does not so much argue as state profound truths in the manner of a real Seer. The prose comes with the confidence of one who has experienced these truths in his own life. Whilst the prose is poetic, the poetry can similarly educate like prose. There is beauty and power in the poetry, but Sri Chinmoy also uses short poetic aphorisms as a means to reinforce the meaning of prose in the minimum of words.</p>
