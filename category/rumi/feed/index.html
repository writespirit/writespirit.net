<h3> If </h3>
<p >If you can disentangle <br />
yourself from your selfish self<br />
all heavenly spirits<br />
will stand ready to serve you</p>
<p>if you can finally hunt down<br />
   your own beastly self<br />
   you have the right<br />
   to claim Solomon&#8217;s kingdom</p>
<p>you are that blessed soul who<br />
   belongs to the garden of paradise<br />
   is it fair to let yourself<br />
   fall apart in a shattered house</p>
<p>you are the bird of happiness<br />
   in the magic of existence<br />
   what a pity when you let<br />
   yourself be chained and caged</p>
<p>but if you can break free<br />
   from this dark prison named body<br />
   soon you will see<br />
   you are the sage and the fountain of life</p>

<p>Oh God <br />
    Let all lovers be content <br />
    Give them happy endings <br />
    Let their lives be celebrations <br />
    Let their hearts dance in the fire of your  love. <br /></ br>
  </p>
</div>
<p>From: <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/the_poetseers/love">Love poems of Rumi</a> &#8211; Deepak Chopra </p>
</p>
<p>To  celebrate the 800th birth anniversary of mystic poet Jelalludin Rumi  UNESCO has announced that the year&nbsp; 2007  will be the International&nbsp; Year of Rumi  Year. During the next year there will be special ceremonies and programs held  all over the world to commemorate this great Persian poet. In particular  celebrations will focus on Rumi&rsquo;s place of birth and Turkey where he lived for  many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rumi was born in Balkh in what is now Afganisthan. Balkh was  then part of the Persian Empire the precursor of modern day Iran. Rumi spent most of his life living in Turkey and was buried in Konya, Turkey</p>
<h4>Rumi&#8217;s Poetry </h4>
<p><a href="http://www.poetseers.org/the_poetseers/rumis_poetry">Rumi&rsquo;s poetry</a> and philosophy is based on tolerance,  openness, and the overwhelming power of universal love. </p>
<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;When in Love, <br />
    body, mind, heart and soul don&#8217;t even exist.<br />
    Become this, <br />
  fall in Love, and you will not be separated again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>- Rumi <br />
  Trans. by: Sharam Shiva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote" >&quot;The fault is in the  blamer<br />
Spirit sees nothing  to criticize&quot;</p>
<p >- Rumi <br />
  From: Wisdom of Rumi by: Timothy Freke</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rumi had the capacity to appear beyond cultural and national  boundaries. This helps to explain his universal appeal, both during his life  and in the modern world, 800 years after his birth. Many of the western  translations have downplayed the importance of Rumi&rsquo;s Islamic studies, however  Rumi was well known as being one of the foremost scholars of the time. The  Qu&rsquo;ran provides significant inspiration for his poetry and writings. However  although brought up in the tradition of Islam Rumi is at heart a Sufi mystic  who goes beyond the domain of religion and intellectual study. He also weaved  everyday occurrences and fables into his poetry, whilst giving a glimpse of a  divine life far transcending the ordinary world. In particular Rumi was a great  believer in the spiritual power of music. Through absorption in spiritual music  an aspirant was able to go beyond his ego and experience the bliss of divine  communion.</p>
<p>For Rumi spirituality involved a profound change of  consciousness, a transformation so marked it was like the proverbial rebirth of  a seeker.</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;I was dead, then alive.<br />
Weeping, then laughing.</p>
<p>The power of love came into me,<br />
and I became fierce like a lion,<br />
then tender like the evening star.&quot;</p>
<p>From: Odes of Rumi<br />
  By: Coleman Barks</p>
<p>The key moment in Rumi&rsquo;s life came when he met his master  and wandering dervish called Shams. It was the dishevelled Shams who awoke in  Rumi a passionate longing for union with the Divine. On discovering the inner  path of love Rumi lost interest in scholarly debate and devoted his life to  spiritual practises and the writing of poetry. Rumi&#8217;s major work is the Masnawi. The Masnawi is often called the &quot;Qur&#8217;an-e Parsi&quot; (The Persian Qur&#8217;an). It is considered by many to be one of the greatest works of mystical poetry. Rumi&#8217;s other major work is the Divan of Shams</p>
<p>It is perhaps ironic that a muslim mystic from Persia has  become America&rsquo;s best selling poet in the past years. The Essential Rumi  translated by Coleman Barks has sold 250,000 copies. &ldquo;The Soul of Rumi&rdquo; was  published in September 2001 and has gone on to be a very popular seller.</p>
