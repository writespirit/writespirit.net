<p style="padding-left: 30px">A marvellous sun looked down from ecstasy&#8217;s skies<br />
On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection&#8217;s home,<br />
Magical unfoldings of the Eternal&#8217;s smile<br />
Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight.<br />
God&#8217;s everlasting day surrounded her,<br />
Domains appeared of sempiternal light<br />
Invading all Nature with the Absolute&#8217;s joy.<br />
Her body quivered with eternity&#8217;s touch,<br />
Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span id="more-20051"></span><br />
Infinity&#8217;s finite fronts she lived in, new<br />
For ever to an everliving sight.<br />
Eternity multiplied its vast self-look<br />
Translating its endless mightiness and joy<br />
Into delight souls playing with Time could share<br />
In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths,<br />
In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights,<br />
In passionate heart-beats of an undying love,<br />
In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade.<br />
Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes,<br />
In serene arches of translucent calm<br />
From Wonder&#8217;s dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down<br />
An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes<br />
Which suffered without pain the absolute ray<br />
And saw immortal clarities of form.<br />
Twilight and mist were exiles from that air,<br />
Night was impossible to such radiant heavens.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo</p>

<p>In open casket dark and gleaming</p>
<p>richly draped in mourning velvet,</p>
<p>I turn into the setting sun,</p>
<p>my final journey now begun.</p>
<p>So calmly swift this polished boat,</p>
<p>so calm and bright the golden sea;</p>
<p>and just ahead, the bright horizon;</p>
<p>and just beyond, the splendor free.</p>
<p>Forgotten all those clumsy dreams</p>
<p>rising up in dark of mind;</p>
<p>earthly beauty left behind.</p>
<p>Now I touch, I drink the sun!</p>
<p>This I, once thick with form and flesh,</p>
<p>slowly rising</p>
<p>through dense atmospheres of life,</p>
<p>now pulses with light –</p>
<p>a glowing awareness</p>
<p>without center or source,</p>
<p>a luminous stillness</p>
<p>in the calm luminous stillness,</p>
<p>the endless course.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-509" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/Airborne-Spirits-488x300.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="300" /></p>
<p>I think a while of Love, and while I think,<br />
Love is to me a world,<br />
Sole meat and sweetest drink,<br />
And close connecting link<br />
Tween heaven and earth.</p>
<p><span id="more-19088"></span></p>
<p>I only know it is, not how or why,<br />
My greatest happiness;<br />
However hard I try,<br />
Not if I were to die,<br />
Can I explain.</p>
<p>I fain would ask my friend how it can be,<br />
But when the time arrives,<br />
Then Love is more lovely<br />
Than anything to me,<br />
And so I&#8217;m dumb.</p>
<p>For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak,<br />
But only thinks and does;<br />
Though surely out &#8217;twill leak<br />
Without the help of Greek,<br />
Or any tongue.</p>
<p>A man may love the truth and practise it,<br />
Beauty he may admire,<br />
And goodness not omit,<br />
As much as may befit<br />
To reverence.</p>
<p>But only when these three together meet,<br />
As they always incline,<br />
And make one soul the seat,<br />
And favorite retreat,<br />
Of loveliness;</p>
<p>When under kindred shape, like loves and hates<br />
And a kindred nature,<br />
Proclaim us to be mates,<br />
Exposed to equal fates<br />
Eternally;</p>
<p>And each may other help, and service do,<br />
Drawing Love&#8217;s bands more tight,<br />
Service he ne&#8217;er shall rue<br />
While one and one make two,<br />
And two are one;</p>
<p>In such case only doth man fully prove<br />
Fully as man can do,<br />
What power there is in Love<br />
His inmost soul to move<br />
Resistlessly.</p>
<p>______</p>
<p>Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side,<br />
Withstand the winter&#8217;s storm,<br />
And spite of wind and tide,<br />
Grow up the meadow&#8217;s pride,<br />
For both are strong</p>
<p>Above they barely touch, but undermined<br />
Down to their deepest source,<br />
Admiring you shall find<br />
Their roots are intertwined<br />
Insep&#8217;rably.</p>

The Soul that rises with us, our life&#8217;s Star,<br />
Hath had elsewhere its setting,<br />
And cometh from afar:<br />
Not in entire forgetfulness,<br />
And not in utter nakedness,<br />
But trailing clouds of glory do we come<br />
From God, who is our home:<br />
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-438" title="light-trees" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/light-trees.jpg" alt="light-trees" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright:<br />
The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love&#8217;s<br />
detachment beats the time.<br />
Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kabîr<br />
says:<br />
&#8220;My Beloved One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Kabir</p>
<p><span id="more-19080"></span>Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?<br />
Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and<br />
night,<br />
There are the hidden banner and the secret canopy:<br />
There the sound of the unseen bells is heard.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the<br />
Universe sitteth on His throne.&#8221;<br />
The whole world does its works and commits its errors: but few<br />
are the lovers who know the Beloved.<br />
The devout seeker is he who mingles in his heart the double<br />
currents of love and detachment, like the mingling of the<br />
streams of Ganges and Jumna;<br />
In his heart the sacred water flows day and night; and thus the<br />
round of births and deaths is brought to an end.</p>
<p>Behold what wonderful rest is in the Supreme Spirit!  and he<br />
enjoys it, who makes himself meet for it.<br />
Held by the cords of love, the swing of the Ocean of Joy sways to<br />
and fro; and a mighty sound breaks forth in song.<br />
See what a lotus blooms there without water!  and Kabîr says<br />
&#8220;My heart&#8217;s bee drinks its nectar.&#8221;<br />
What a wonderful lotus it is, that blooms at the heart of the<br />
spinning wheel of the universe!  Only a few pure souls know of<br />
its true delight.<br />
Music is all around it, and there the heart partakes of the joy<br />
of the Infinite Sea.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Dive thou into that Ocean of sweetness: thus let all<br />
errors of life and of death flee away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behold how the thirst of the five senses is quenched there!  and<br />
the three forms of misery are no more!<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;It is the sport of the Unattainable One: look<br />
within, and behold how the moon-beams of that Hidden One shine<br />
in you.&#8221;<br />
There falls the rhythmic beat of life and death:<br />
Rapture wells forth, and all space is radiant with light.<br />
There the Unstruck Music is sounded; it is the music of the love<br />
of the three worlds.<br />
There millions of lamps of sun and of moon are burning;<br />
There the drum beats, and the lover swings in play.<br />
There love-songs resound, and light rains in showers; and the<br />
worshipper is entranced in the taste of the heavenly nectar.<br />
Look upon life and death; there is no separation between them,<br />
The right hand and the left hand are one and the same.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There the wise man is speechless; for this truth may<br />
never be found in Vadas or in books.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have had my Seat on the Self-poised One,<br />
I have drunk of the Cup of the Ineffable,<br />
I have found the Key of the Mystery,<br />
I have reached the Root of Union.<br />
Travelling by no track, I have come to the Sorrowless Land: very<br />
easily has the mercy of the great Lord come upon me.<br />
They have sung of Him as infinite and unattainable: but I in my<br />
meditations have seen Him without sight.<br />
That is indeed the sorrowless land, and none know the path that<br />
leads there:<br />
Only he who is on that path has surely transcended all sorrow.<br />
Wonderful is that land of rest, to which no merit can win;<br />
It is the wise who has seen it, it is the wise who has sung of<br />
it.<br />
This is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous<br />
savour?<br />
He who has savoured it once, he knows what joy it can give.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the<br />
wise man becomes speechless and silent,<br />
The worshipper is utterly inebriated,<br />
His wisdom and his detachment are made perfect;<br />
He drinks from the cup of the inbreathings and the outbreathings<br />
of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the whole sky is filled with sound, and there that music is<br />
made without fingers and without strings;<br />
There the game of pleasure and pain does not cease.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you<br />
will find your life in the Supreme Land of Bliss.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a frenzy of ecstasy there is in every hour! and the<br />
worshipper is pressing out and drinking the essence of the<br />
hours: he lives in the life of Brahma.<br />
I speak truth, for I have accepted truth in life; I am now<br />
attached to truth, I have swept all tinsel away.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;Thus is the worshipper set free from fear; thus have<br />
all errors of life and of death left him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the sky is filled with music:<br />
There it rains nectar:<br />
There the harp-strings jingle, and there the drums beat.<br />
What a secret splendour is there, in the mansion of the sky!<br />
There no mention is made of the rising and the setting of the<br />
sun;<br />
In the ocean of manifestation, which is the light of love, day<br />
and night are felt to be one.<br />
Joy for ever, no sorrow,&#8211;no struggle!<br />
There have I seen joy filled to the brim, perfection of joy;<br />
No place for error is there.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There have I witnessed the sport of One Bliss!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have known in my body the sport of the universe: I have escaped<br />
from the error of this world..<br />
The inward and the outward are become as one sky, the Infinite<br />
and the finite are united: I am drunken with the sight of this<br />
All!<br />
This Light of Thine fulfils the universe: the lamp of love that<br />
burns on the salver of knowledge.<br />
Kabîr says: &#8220;There error cannot enter, and the conflict of life<br />
and death is felt no more.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429" title="ARUNACHALA-BLUE-unmesh" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/ARUNACHALA-BLUE-unmesh.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am sitting on a mountain.<br />
I am casting shadows into the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I did not invite it but the sun has come<br />
And is now playing tag with my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am whispering to clouds today,<br />
“Watch out for my shoulders,”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For I wish no harm<br />
To all my soft friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where do you think you will Be<br />
When God reveals Himself<br />
Inside of you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-19078"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was so glad to hear<br />
That every pillow in this world<br />
Will become stuffed with<br />
My soul and beard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am sitting on a mountain range.<br />
I am a precious body of living water<br />
Offered to the earth<br />
From Light’s own hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Why ever talk of miracles<br />
When you are destined to become<br />
Infinite love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Still, the Final Grace was left:<br />
For all of existence and Hafiz to blend<br />
And to find that I am every pillow<br />
Offering comfort</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To each mind and<br />
Foot.</p>
