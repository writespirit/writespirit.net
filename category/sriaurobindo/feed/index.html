				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 12 September 1939, Sri Aurobindo wrote the following sonnet;</p>
<p>THE GREATER PLAN</p>
<p>I am held no more by life&#8217;s alluring cry,<br />
Her joy and grief, her charm, her laughter&#8217;s lute.<br />
Hushed are the magic moments of the flute,<br />
And form and colour and brief ecstacy.<br />
I would hear, in my spirit&#8217;s wideness solitary<br />
The Voice that speaks when mortal lips are mute:<br />
I seek the wonder of things absolute<br />
Born from the silence of Eternity.</p>
<p>There is a need within the soul of man<br />
The splendours of the surface never sate;<br />
For life and mind and their glory and debate<br />
Are the slow prelude of a vaster theme,<br />
A sketch confused of a supernal plan,<br />
A preface to the epic of the Supreme.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p><span id="more-19275"></span></p>
<p>Like many of us this sonnet speaks directly to the individual seeking a greater meaning in their life. No more satisfied with the alluring desires of the current material world or charmed by the laughter of pleasures indulged, the author points to the wonder of things absolute as a means of uncovering the magic moments of joy that can be heard when mortal lips are mute. Sri Aurobindo writes that &#8216;there is a need within the soul of man the splendours of the surface never sate;&#8217;. What is that need?</p>
<p>We are left with this clear answer, The Greater Plan, of which our outer lives of glory and debate form a prelude or confused sketch to the real journey, the epic of the Supreme. For many this sonnet is an inspirational pointer to a wider vision of life, which includes a higher more selfless goal for all of us, which may be summarised in the simple form as &#8216;not my will, but Thy be done.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">His name the index of a failing hope,<br />
The position of a dead remembered star.<br />
Only were safe who kept God in their hearts:<br />
Courage their armour, faith their sword, they must walk,<br />
The hand ready to smite, the eye to scout,<br />
Casting a javelin regard in front,<br />
Heroes and soldiers of the army of Light.<br />
Hardly even so, the grisly danger past,<br />
Released into a calmer purer air,<br />
They dared at length to breathe and smile once more.<br />
Once more they moved beneath a real sun.<br />
Though Hell claimed rule, the spirit still had power.<br />
This No-man&#8217;s-land he passed without debate;<br />
Him the heights missioned, him the Abyss desired:<br />
None stood across his way, no voice forbade.<br />
For swift and easy is the downward path,<br />
And now towards the Night was turned his face.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo, Savitri</p>

<p>The silent Soul of all the world was there:<br />
A Being lived, a Presence and a Power,<br />
A single Person who was himself and all<br />
And cherished Nature&#8217;s sweet and dangerous throbs<br />
Transfigured into beats divine and pure.<br />
One who could love without return for love,<br />
Meeting and turning to the best the worst,<br />
It healed the bitter cruelties of earth,<br />
Transforming all experience to delight;<br />
Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth<br />
It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child<br />
And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy;<br />
It led things evil towards their secret good,<br />
It turned racked falsehood into happy truth;<br />
Its power was to reveal divinity.</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The immense remoteness of her trance had passed; <br />
Human she was once more, earth&#8217;s Savitri, <br />
Yet felt in her illimitable change. <br />
A power dwelt in her soul too great for earth, <br />
A bliss lived in her heart too large for heaven; <br />
Light too intense for thought and love too boundless <br />
For earth&#8217;s emotions lit her skies of mind <br />
And spread through her deep and happy seas of soul. <br />
All that is sacred in the world drew near <br />
To her divine passivity of mood. <br />
A marvellous voice of silence breathed its thoughts. <br />
All things in Time and Space she had taken for hers;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an essay written in 1918 and entitled The Renaissance in India, Sri Aurobindo presents us with a masterly view of India&#8217;s culture through the ages &#8212; her essential spirit and her characteristic soul, her unique genius and powers which gave her her remarkably long periods of greatness and an unusually prolific creativity &#8212; that which allowed her to survive for so long when other ancient civilisations faded away. He explains the basis of her strength &#8212; that which enabled her to resist so many attempts at crushing her culture. </p>

<h3>Cosmic Consciousness </h3>
<p >I have wrapped the wide world in my wider self<br />
   And Time and Space my spirit&#8217;s seeing are.<br />
   I am the god and demon, ghost and elf,<br />
   I am the wind&#8217;s speed and the blazing star.</p>
<p>   All Nature is the nursling of my care,<br />
   I am its struggle and the eternal rest;<br />
   The world&#8217;s joy thrilling runs through me, I bear<br />
   The sorrow of millions in my lonely breast.</p>
<p>   I have learned a close identity with all,<br />
   Yet am by nothing bound that I become;<br />
   Carrying in me the universe&#8217;s call<br />
   I mount to my imperishable home.</p>
<p>   I pass beyond Time and life on measureless wings,<br />
  Yet still am one with born and unborn things.</p>
