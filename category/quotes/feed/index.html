If there is sin, this is the only sin &#8211; to say that you are weak, or others are weak.”</span></p>
<p> Swami Vivekananda</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The soul in man is greater than his fate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">- Sri Aurobindo, Savitri</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;" align="center">&#8220;The soul that can<br />
Live alone with itself<br />
Meets God..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">- Sri Aurobindo, Savitri</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;" align="center">&#8220;Our soul has infinite potentiality and this infinite potentiality has to be manifested here on earth. The soul came from the Supreme to manifest Him. The more the soul manifests Truth or Divinity, the greater the achievement both for the soul and for the Supreme.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;" align="center">The body was born and it will die. But for the soul there is no death. It is like the betel-nut. When the nut is ripe it does not stick to the shell. But when it is green it is difficult to separate it from the shell. After realizing God, one does not identify oneself any more with the body. Then one knows that body and soul are two different things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">- Sri Ramakrishna [2]</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;" align="center">&#8220;Love is the song of the soul, singing to God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">P.Yogananda [3]</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;" align="center">&#8220;The soul migrates from body to body. Weapons cannot cleave it, nor fire consume it, nor water drench it, nor wind dry it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jealousy<br />
is a deep-rooted<br />
Love-rejection-life.</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jealousy<br />
And supremacy<br />
Are always fond<br />
Of living together.</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p><span id="more-19099"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a way to conquer jealousy.<br />
Take jealousy as a piece of cloth.<br />
Use your utmost power<br />
To tear that piece of cloth<br />
Into hundreds of pieces.<br />
While tearing the piece of cloth,<br />
Just think of all the jealousies you have.<br />
Your jealousy is bound to disappear.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jealousy<br />
Is an instant<br />
Joy-killer.</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jealousy happily<br />
Plies its boat<br />
Between the inner tragedies<br />
And outer tragedies<br />
Of its rivals.</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8221; Finally, the real spiritual way to conquer jealousy is to feel that you are one with the person who is the object of your jealousy. For example, if someone is a better actor than you are, feel that it is you who are acting. In this way, you can conquer jealousy and, at the same time, expand your own consciousness. &#8220;</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy [3]</p>

<p>Even pain and grief are garbs of world-delight,<br />
It hides behind thy sorrow and thy cry.<br />
Because thy strength is a part and not God&#8217;s whole,<br />
Because afflicted by the little self<br />
Thy consciousness forgets to be divine<br />
As it walks in the vague penumbra of the flesh<br />
And cannot bear the world&#8217;s tremendous touch,<br />
Thou criest out and sayst that there is pain.<br />
Indifference, pain and joy, a triple disguise,<br />
Attire of the rapturous Dancer in the ways,<br />
Withhold from thee the body of God&#8217;s bliss.<br />
Thy spirit&#8217;s strength shall make thee one with God,<br />
Thy agony shall change to ecstasy,<br />
Indifference deepen into infinity&#8217;s calm<br />
And joy laugh nude on the peaks of the Absolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mind finds it difficult to be happy, precisely because the mind consciously enjoys the sense of separativity. It is always judging and doubting the reality in others. This is the human mind, the ordinary physical mind, the earth-bound mind.</p>
<p>But we also have the aspiring heart, the loving heart. This loving heart is free from insecurity, for it has already established its oneness with the rest of the world. This heart carries the message of self-offering, and self-offering is God-discovery.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-518" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="search-secret-india" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/search-secret-india.jpg" alt="search secret india" width="300" height="300" />A Search in Secret India</em> by Paul Brunton was published in 1934 and instantly became a classic of spiritual literature. It is the story of one man’s personal odyssey -  A search to find the real meaning behind life. Through his entertaining and illumining journey, Paul Brunton shows a glimpse into a relatively unknown side to India. An India of fakirs, astrologers, Spiritual Gurus and a living spirituality. Students on any spiritual path will enjoy sharing the experiences and universal truths of this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disillusioned by life in England, Paul Brunton hoped to find in India, a spirituality his soul was eager to find.  The book combines a rigorous Western journalistic standard with a sympathy and openness to the Spirituality of India. Just a few decades before, his compatriot, Rudyard Kipling had famously said. &#8220;East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.&#8221; But, Brunton was a pathfinder in breaking down this barrier and seeking a union in diversity.</p>
<p><span id="more-19095"></span></p>
<p>With his Western analytical mind, Paul Brunton is able to distinguish between minor occultists and genuine Rishi’s who sought and realised God. But, whoever he meets, he manages to offer a fair balanced appraisal of what he experiences.</p>
<p>As well as being a guide to spirituality,  it helped change attitudes to India. In the 1930s, Britain ruled India and often opinions of India were often based on crude generalisations. This book helped to open up another side to India. It also helped to popularise concepts such as meditation and yoga. In particular, it was Paul Brunton who made the Spiritual Master, <a href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/ramana_maharshi/life_of_ramana_maharshi/">Ramana Maharshi</a> known in the West.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-519 aligncenter" title="ARUNACHALA-BLUE-unmesh" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/ARUNACHALA-BLUE-unmesh.jpg" alt="Arunachala - maharshi" width="500" height="362" /></p>
<p>There are many colourful chapters from snake charmers, and astrologers to Sages who don’t speak. But, the highlight is undoubtedly, the final chapter where, at the end of his quest, he stumbles across sacred Mount Arunachala, where he meets Ramana Maharshi (who he recognises as his Guru).</p>
<p>It is a truism that the heights of meditation cannot adequately be expressed by the written word, but Brunton manages to leave us a glimpse into profound meditation he experienced.</p>
<p>To close, from the last chapter, Tablets of Forgotten Truth</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“There is That in man which belongs to an imperishable race. He neglects his true self almost completely, but his neglect can never affect of alter its shining greatness. He may forget it and entirely go to sleep in the senses, yet on the day when it stretches forth its hand and touches him, he shall remember who he is and recover his soul.”</p>
<p>- Paul Brunton, p 306</p>

<p>A fleeting life is all we have. So why do we boast, why do we disproportionately exaggerate our earthly, mortal and brittle achievements? The physical in us, no matter how strong, fails us when the Prince of Gloom appears. When death appears, the physical deserts us no matter how strong it is, the vital deserts us no matter how enthusiastic it is, the mind deserts us no matter how brilliant it is, the heart deserts us no matter how kind and pure it is.</p>
<p>A fleeting life is all we have. Why then do we listen to the dictates of the physical world, the temptation- world? Why? Why? Why do we not listen to the dictates of the all-illumining and all-fulfilling soul? Why? Why? Why do we dine each night, all night long, with ignorance-sea? Why do we sport with darkness-dragon every day, all day long? Why? Why? Why do we not love God even conditionally, if it is impossible for us to love God unconditionally? Why? Why?</p>
<p><span id="more-19091"></span></p>
<p>A fleeting life is all we have. Why do we not please God partially, if it is not within our capacity to please God totally and unreservedly? Why? Why? Can we not say to God once and for all that, although we have given all of our previous lives, even to the previous second, to ignorance-night, from now on we shall give this fleeting life of ours to Him alone? Can we not give God the full authority to guide us, mould us and shape us in His own way? Since we have failed in the hands of ignorance, can we not give God a chance to direct our life? If God too fails, then we shall see what we ourselves can do with our life. But is it not fair on our part at least to give God a chance, as countless times we have given chances to ignorance-night? Let this short incarnation of ours be offered to God and God alone. If we offer our life to God, then ours will be the life short in years but long in achievements.</p>
<p>God says to us, &#8220;Children, I have promised you that I shall not misuse you, I shall not misguide you. I shall prove to you that I can make new personalities, new realities and new divinities out of you; only give Me a chance. As you have time and again given chances to ignorance, even so for this short, fleeting time give Me the chance and see what I can do for you, since you cannot see what I have already done for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children, give Me a chance and see what I can do in this fleeting life of yours. This fleeting life can be expanded and extended, My children, if you care to envision My Divinity with your surrendered heart and with your oneness-soul. A fleeting life need not and cannot be the last word of the earth-arena. An endless life, a birthless and deathless life, can alone satisfy man, the future God.&#8221;</p>

<p>~Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof.&#8221;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Faith is like a lamp and wisdom makes the flame burn bright. Carry this lamp always and in good time the darkness will yield and you will abide in the Light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dhammavadaka</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8221; When I approached God at that time, I hardly had a living faith in Him. The agnostic was in me, the atheist was in me, the sceptic was in me and I was not absolutely sure that there was a God at all. I did not feel His presence. Yet something drew me to the truth of the Vedas, the truth of the Gita, the truth of the Hindu religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Sri Aurobindo The Uttarpara Address (1909)</p>

<p>Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The fruit of silence is prayer<br />
the fruit of prayer is faith<br />
the fruit of faith is love<br />
the fruit of love is service<br />
the fruit of service is peace.</p>
<p>- Mother Teresa</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Doubt is an old disease.<br />
Faith is an old medicine.<br />
Compassion is an old doctor.<br />
Concern is an old nurse.</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy</p>
