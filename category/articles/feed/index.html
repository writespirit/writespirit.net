				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The happiest man in God’s creation.</p>
<p>Make yourself known to humanity:<br />
Its dark jealousy will make you unhappy.<br />
Make yourself known to yourself:<br />
You will unquestionably be<br />
The happiest man in God’s entire creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>It might be interesting to have a look at the philosophical development of happiness in a historical context. A good place to begin a search for happiness might not be in Europe during the middle ages where life must have been pretty hard for most people, with seemingly constant wars, the threat of disease, hunger and religious superstitions all rife. Especially it would seem for women. (Please don’t burn that witch, before she cooks me my dinner) For many the idea of dying and going to a beautiful heaven was all that was worth living for! The Renaissance began a new chapter in western history and the development of perhaps a new meaning of happiness.</p>
<p>Take for instance Francis Hutcheson, who was born in 1694 in Ireland, to Scottish parents and later moved back to Glasgow. He is generally regarded as the founding father of the Scottish Enlightenment. He believed that man universally carried within himself the means to learn how to be virtuous and helpful to others. Men served others not because they had no choice in it, if they wanted to get along with others, but because they realized they actually enjoyed doing it. (By the way, women still really had no choice in it!) He believed that helping others suffused us with a sense of well-being and pleasure. Being good meant doing good to others. Virtue (and to some extent the ten commandments!) required it, but our feelings confirmed it.</p>
<p>The link between feelings and happiness was important. Man was born to make other’s lives more pleasant, and to be wicked or vicious was to be miserable and unhappy. A delight in the good of others becomes the basis of our sense of right and wrong. We decided that what helps and pleases a person, is good, because it gives us pleasure. What injures him is bad, because it causes us pain. Men begin to realize that the happiness of others is also their own happiness. Some vulgar people assumed, mistakenly, that happiness meant the gratification of the physical desires: food, drink, and sex. But for Hutcheson the highest form of happiness was making others happy. The desire to be moral and virtuous, to treat others with kindness, and the desire to be free were universal, and human beings wanted them because it made them happy.<br />
Thomas Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence in 1776 enshrined these same ideals in writing for the American people. Jefferson believed that happiness was the aim of life, and that virtue was the foundation of happiness. He wrote that, all men are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights; among these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p><span id="more-19281"></span></p>
<p>However this view was not held universally by all around that time. Lord Kames (a Scottish lawyer) argued that morality arose from human aspirations rather than divine ones. Kames believed that happiness came from the acquisition of property and that laws to protect the possessions honestly acquired formed the focus of good governments. (rather than to pursue the common good of all.) Probably at that time most of the poor could only honestly acquire a loaf of bread! He said that “Man is disposed by nature to appropriate. My property is an important part of my sense of self, an important sense of my personality. Property makes me a whole and complete human being”.<br />
The happiest society (presumably full of happy citizens), Kames concluded, was where the progress of capitalism polished the manners of men, whereas uncivilized peoples lacked the self interest of personal ownership to interact in a happy and productive way.</p>
<p>It seems now that Kames view became the mantra of progress throughout most of the populations of the developed world and the common incentive for many in the developing nations. So was he right? Well, about a hundred years later, a man from India came to America and gave an address at the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago in 1893. Swami Vivekananda lectured about Vedanta (the knowledge of the Vedas, India’s holy scriptures). He introduced the idea that this world is an illusion and that, as he put it, “God is only true, the world is not true. Let the world fall to ruin around my ears: I do not care. So with the next life, I do not care to go to heaven. By going to heaven we only prolong the miserable illusions. In heaven you become gods, drink nectar, and get rheumatism.”</p>
<p>If the world is indeed an illusion as Vivekananda argues, then it follows that we, being part of the material world, equally are just an illusion, formed somewhere in our brains by the decoding of the duality matrix surrounding us. Philosophically then any feelings I may have are also illusory, including happiness, (or lack of it). Swami Vivekananda taught that, “God is the only reality, and that the real in me is God. Thou art That. Thou art the Reality”!</p>
<p>The question then becomes, is God happiness? Fortunately for us Sri Chinmoy offers an answer in the form of a poem. He writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience and Reality.</p>
<p>My Supreme Lord,<br />
What is the difference<br />
Between happiness and delight?<br />
“My child, happiness is an experience,<br />
And delight is a reality<br />
That transcends experience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>Here Sri Chinmoy suggests that God is in fact Delight, a higher level of consciousness that transcends happiness. Therefore a more perfect way of defining happiness maybe that it is an illusory experience that we can experience in this illusory world. However if we can break or suspend the illusion and identify ourselves with or as the real Reality, then it is possible for us to transcend the dualities of happiness and pain, and become Delight itself. Many great spiritual teachers over the ages have expressed the notion that this is the true reason and meaning to our lives, a higher purpose often simply expressed by the term, Oneness. (As in, I and my Father are one.)</p>
<p>In 1976 Sri Chinmoy offered a University lecture entitled, Happiness. In the lecture he writes, “Happiness can be found only in our conscious surrender to God’s Will. Right now, here on earth, we enjoy false happiness in the body, vital, mind and heart. But there comes a time when real happiness, divine happiness, dawns. At that time the body is fully awake and consciously offering its service-light, the vital is dynamic, the mind is calm and quite and the heart feels its oneness, its inseparable oneness, with the rest of the world”.</p>
<p>So a goal of life maybe stated as, to integrally raise ones consciousness to become Delight-Oneness, and thus having removed the illusion of duality, to live in the world in constant Delight as a service to others who have not yet attained to this goal. On the road to this goal, a pertinent question would be whether or not it is preferable to experience happiness or sadness? Well that depends on you. If you know both as an illusion then you might want to try both. (As most of us have.) It is generally accepted in society that happiness is a preferable state to live in than sadness or depression. In fact a huge array of industries, pastimes, and distractions have all been developed to try to create and maintain a sense of happiness for people all around the world.</p>
<p>Some people have believed the opposite to be true. For example, in the MahaBharata, the classical Indian epic, Draupadi, the wife/queen of the Pandava family, preferred to live in a state of unhappiness, because she felt that in this way she devoted herself, and relied more, on the help of Sri Krishna, who she considered the Lord incarnate at that time. Now many people also seem to be caught in an unconsciously depressive and destructive way of living. Many are unable to change their reality. The high rates of suicide, drug, alcohol and gambling addictions, and violence among young people and others, maybe partly attributed to a general unhappiness in our communities. Most governments try to address this problem by maintaining low levels of unemployment.</p>
<p>So an historical look at the state of happiness reveals a changing and diverse range of meanings. What the future holds is really up to the individual to create for themselves. However in the area of happiness, it seems that throughout history there has been one common thread, and that is, to “Know Thyself” is to know true happiness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a guest post by Manatita</p>
<p>In this essay, the writer will first show the essentials of Yama and Niyama and its relation to Yoga, and will conclude with the practical aspect of how these two ?abstinences?, has affected his daily life and Yoga practice.</p>
<p>Yama and Niyama are the first steps in Yoga practice. They are considered the foundations of Yoga. They are the first two limbs of the eight-fold Path of Patanjali &#8211; the ancient sage &#8211; the rest being:-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Asana &#8211; bodily postures. They combine a series of exhaustive exercises, widely known in the West as Hatha Yoga, for the health and discipline of the physical. They are also useful for the movement of the life-force and the attainment of the Higher Yoga.</li>
<li>Pranayama &#8211; control of the life-force. It involves the inhaling, retention and exhaling of breath.</li>
<li>Pratyahara &#8211; withdrawal of the senses from the external world</li>
<li>Dharana &#8211; concentration &#8211; control of or steadying of the mind on a particular object to the exclusion of everything else.</li>
<li>Dhyana &#8211; the gazing or fixing of the mind on a Higher Consciousness. Sri Chinmoy, in his book The Silent teaching, 1985, refers to it as conscious self-expansion?.?silence, energizing and fulfilling?the eloquent expression of the inexpressible?</li>
<li>Samadhi &#8211; profound contemplation or the tuning of the inner self with the Universal Self. This is a profound state and achieved by only a few. (Gibson, WB: The Key to Yoga, 1958)</li>
</ul>
<div><span id="more-19051"></span></div>
<p>Yoga means to yoke, to bring together, and to merge. Yoga is union with God &#8211; the union of the individual self with the transcendental Self (Sri Chinmoy: Yoga and the Spiritual Life).</p>
<p>Yama and Niyama are the ?do?s? and ?don?ts or ethical principles of Yoga, sometimes likened to the Ten Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount. Even ?Effort and Relaxation.? The two, being so closely related, are sometimes described as one, but Yama, nevertheless, is the first step.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Yama &#8211; self-restraint/forbearance/right-thinking &#8211; things to avoid doing because it will bring harm to the individual and to society. These are the ?don?ts?:</li>
<li>Ahimsa &#8211; Non-injury &#8211; to abstain from harming all forms of living creatures through thoughts, words or deeds. Ahimsa is an inner virtue. Here purity of intent is very important. As we may sometimes have to kill to sustain life or even walk on creatures without seeing. Sincerity of purpose and purity of intent is of paramount importance. Ahimsa is an inner attitude in which hatred is replaced by love. It is true sacrifice, forgiveness and power. (Swami Sivananda: Bliss divine, P. 15)</li>
<li>Satya &#8211; Non-lying or truthfulness &#8211; to be true to oneself, ones thoughts, words and actions should agree. However, according to Blake the poet or Sri Ramakrishna, the Great spiritual Master of India, one should never tell a cruel truth.</li>
<li>Asteya <cite>-</cite> Non-stealing or honesty <cite>-</cite> desire or craving is said to be the root cause of stealing and dishonesty. When one is free of the yearning for material objects or gains, the attraction to gaining objects through immoral means will cease.</li>
<li>Bramacharya &#8211; Non-sensuality, continence &#8211; this is freedom from lust in thought, word or deed. (Swami Sivananda: Gospel of Divine Life, 1985) It includes freedom from physical as well as mental pleasures. Even in the dream state. Here Yoga postures such as Sirshasana and also Sattvic (wholesome) food can help a great deal. One also needs to be careful with immoral company and to be inwardly vigilante at all times. (Prabhavananda Swami: Narada?s way of Divine love, 1972).</li>
<li>Aparigraha &#8211; non-greed &#8211; freedom from covetousness and possession beyond one?s needs. These include coveting something belonging to someone else. Non-greed allows one to be free from the fear of loss, hatred &amp; anger towards what other&#8217;s have, or attachment and disappointment when things are lost or unattainable. By the practice of Aparigraha one is aided in the practice of Ahimsa (non-killing), Satya (truthfulness), and Asteya (non-stealing).</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these ?abstinences? is to seek perfection, following the Yama?s more closely day by day. They lessen desires and produces calm, enabling one to devote oneself to the Higher goal of Yoga.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Niyama &#8211; observances &#8211; it consists of purity, both internal and external (Shaucha), contentment (Santosha), the practice of austerity (Tapas), the study and learning of spiritual books (Swadhyaya), and self-surrender to God (Atmanivedana).</li>
<li>Saucha &#8211; purity &#8211; both external and internal. For internal cleansing one should look to having a right diet eating Sattvic (pure) foods that are conducive to meditation and comes from pure sources. The best foods to eat are ones that come from organic sources grown with respect for the earth and the environment. Cleanliness will assist the Prana or life energy carried through the body.</li>
<li>Santosha &#8211; contentment or peacefulness &#8211; generating and releasing hidden energy of our bodies, brings new light to every cell. The more light we bring into the body, into the cells, the more we shall experience Santosha. An inner peace and contentment shall overcome us and fill us with joy and happiness. This peacefulness generally remains irrespective of the state of the world.</li>
<li>Tapas &#8211; spiritual discipline &#8211; Tapas can be likened to Karma-yoga, the yoga of action, because it requires us to act to keep each part of the body and mind clean and pure. It also requires discipline, steadfastness and a burning intensity for Truth.</li>
<li>Swadhyaya &#8211; self-study or spiritual study.</li>
<li>Atmanirvedana &#8211; self-surrender or offering of one?s life to God. This is the Highest Goal. See Sri Chinmoy?s ?Beyond Within? One should be surrendered totally and unconditionally to the Will of the Supreme. It is initially difficult and requires practice, faith, all the above principles plus the company of a realised Soul or God?s Grace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having established what Yoga is, we see that Yama and Niyama as expounded by Patanjali, are really steps to discover one?s true nature. It would appear from the teachings, (Narada Bhakti Sutras??that without Yama and Niyama there is no happiness. Without a code for moral and spiritual values, there is only chaos in life. Nevertheless, a life of wholesome thoughts, study, discipline and exercise, accompanied by Dharana (concentration) and Dhyana (meditation) can and will one day certainly take us to the yogic goal of self-realisation &#8211; total and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme.</p>
<div id="how-yama-and-niyama-has-helped-me" class="section">
<h3><a name="how-yama-and-niyama-has-helped-me"></a>How Yama and Niyama has Helped me.</h3>
<p>Yama and Niyama have put me on the path to a greater awareness of the harmony of living and life?s true purpose. Looking at the Yama?s, especially Ahimsa, has helped me to practice non-violence to all beings. While I still stumble from time to time, my sense of the principles of Patanjali, has deepened my study and sharpened my practice. Naturally this has reflected in my feeling calmer and with a greater acceptance of life here and now.</p>
<p>I feel an acute awareness of the environment and the sacredness of life, and I am less likely to abuse creatures and higher animals. I am now inclined to devote myself to study and spiritual discipline, and also to improve my health so that I can be a better person and instrument for a Higher cause. I move forward positively towards the path of self-restraint.</p>
<p>I strive to be aware of Truth in my Practice, and as best as I can, minimise the hurt that I cause others in my words, thought and deeds. Each Entity is a part of the life energy of Being, and as such, is important to me.</p>
<p>Overall, I eat healthier, encourage positive lifestyles, avoid the negatives of the mundane, and by God?s grace, aim to re-discover life?s true purpose.</p>

</div>
<p>Within man, there are two aspects. There is his real inner, divine self. There is also the body and intellect which, at his present stage of evolution, consider himself to be a separate egoist entity. However, there comes a time when man realises that he is not the body and intellect. His real existence is a state of being; a consciousness at one with the Universal consciousness.</p>
<p>The great pyramids of Egypt hold a real significance in this great spiritual quest.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is great significance in an equilateral triangle. The three sides refer to the tri-natured aspect of God: God the creator, God the preserver and God the transformer. This tri-natured aspect of God, can also be seen in the analogy of a seeker&#8217;s journey. There is the starting point, which represents his birth in the matter of creation, there is then the long journey of evolution and inner discovery; finally ending in the seeker&#8217;s realisation of his true identity. At this point, the seeker loses his identity and re-submerges in his original divine consciousness. Thus there are 3 aspects to a seeker&#8217;s journey. This tri-natured aspect is perfectly reflected in an equilateral triangle, which boasts a perfect symmetry. Within the 3 lines of the triangle, there is the area within. Thus we can say that the one is in the three and the three encompasses the one. This is the nature of God, 3 in 1 and 1 in 3. Thus it is said that God has four faces. Like points on the Compass; the four aspects of God, represent a different aspect of his nature.</p>
<p>The shape of the pyramids is chosen very carefully to reflect these underlying aspects of the divine unity. The pyramid has 4 faces. Three faces to the heavens, and one face to the earth. The pyramid is composed of 4 equilatoral triangles, which all manifest the cosmic nature of God 3 in 1 and 1 in 3. The pyramids were built with the greatest precision. It was not built by slaves, but by adepts who had mastery over nature. They used their understanding of sacred laws to make stones weightless. They could reduce the gravitational pull on huge blocks of stone, thus enabling them to be effortlessly used. The idea of a huge army of slaves building the pyramid, has only been created because many modern egyptologists cannot conceive that the ancient Egyptians may have had technology not available to modern man.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the great pyramids was a place for spiritual initiation. It was in the sacred confines of the great pyramids that initiates would undergo the process of attaining real illumination. The pyramids were chosen because they are an outer symbolism of man&#8217;s inner quest. The spirituality of ancient Egypt was concerned with initiates seeking the Divine within themselves. Unfortunately, over time, the spiritual initiates who guarded the secrets of realisation, lost influence and over time, the pyramids became used for different purposes. This is why it is hard to find evidence of these early spiritual practices.</p>
<p>Two Books which throw much light on the spiritual significance of the great Pyramids include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A Search in Secret Egypy by Paul Brunton &#8211; who spent a night alone in the Great Pyramid itself.</li>
<li>Initiation by Elizabeth Haich. In her books she recounts memories of a former incarnation in Ancient Egypt.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philosophy and spirituality share some common ideas, but also differ in their approach and practise of the truth. To some people there is a wide divergence between philosophy and spirituality. However, to some extent, they share some similarities and both have their role to play in the discovery of truth.</p>
<p><strong>1. Mind and Heart.</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy deals primarily with the mind. It tries to understand, solve and explain problems through mental clarity and written explanation. Philosophy can seek to prove the existence of God, but this proof is always through the medium of the human intellect. In philosophy, it is the mind that is predominant.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Philosophy is in the thinking mind. Philosophy is of the searching mind. Philosophy is for the illumining mind.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>[1] &#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>Spirituality accepts the mind can have a role to play; but, at the same time it can never be satisfied solely with the reasoning of the mind. Spirituality wishes to experience the heart of reality, and not just examine life from the fringes. Spirituality is not so much concerned with proving God&#8217;s existence; spirituality teaches us to make the God a living presence in our consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Spirituality is in the aspiring heart. Spirituality is of the liberating soul. Spirituality is for the fulfilling and immortalising God.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>[1] &#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p><strong>2. Proof vs Experience.</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy seeks to prove and convince others. For example, philosophers seek to prove either the existence or non existence of God. A philosopher can enlighten others to a limited extent. But, in practise, few are converted by the philosophy of others. Even the most persuasive and convincing explanations of God&#8217;s existence leave us unsatisfied. Spirituality is not concerned with convincing others; spirituality is primarily a matter of personal experience. Spirituality is not something to be talked about, but, lived. It may be impossible to explain our spiritual experiences to others, but this does not matter. The belief or disbelief of other people does not impact on our experience. Practising spirituality can give us a genuine feeling of inner peace and connection with our source. When we develop this connection we have good feeling towards others, but, we do not feel responsible for their beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Role of Consciousness.</strong></p>
<p>The essence of spirituality is consciousness. A spiritual seeker seeks to bring to the fore his divine qualities of peace and light. These are not mere words, but, become a living presence. Philosophy can talk about these states of consciousness, but on its own it cannot bring them into the consciousness of the reader. The highest philosophy can lead a seeker along the right path; but, ultimately philosophy has limitations in moving the reader from a mental understanding to a direct experience.</p>
<p><strong>4. Complexity and Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Spirituality loves simplicity. Philosophy loves complexity. Both have their roles to play; but, it is often through simplicity that we can most easily reach the goal. Philosophy takes delight in pursuing multiple lines of inquiry. Hypotheses are tested against the strictures of logic and the most developed reasoning of the mind. Spirituality does not criticize the path of the mind, but, says to the aspiring seeker. &quot;Dive Deep within. All questions can be answered in your silent mind and aspiring heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Philosophy takes us along the path to our destination. It can remove the ignorance and prejudices of the mind. By illumining the mind it can aspire us to understand and grow into the truth. Spirituality urges us to make the truth a living reality. Spirituality and philosophy need not be at loggerheads. Spirituality informs philosophy, it gives added meaning to the illumination of the mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>
&quot;No price is too great to pay for inner peace. &quot;</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>Consciously or unconsciously we are all searching for inner peace. Inner peace is the foundation of lasting happiness, and satisfaction. Without inner peace, man can not know, either himself, or be at peace with the world.</p>
<p><strong>1. Inner Peace is a Choice.</strong></p>
<p>It is our own thoughts that will either bring us peace or restlessness. If our mind is clear of useless, undivine thoughts, we can experience inner peace in abundance. When we lose our inner peace it is because of our own thoughts. It is tempting to blame our problems on the world and other people. However, a man of inner peace will not allow the outer world to disturb his inner mind. If we maintain equanimity and detachment to events of the world, inner peace will remain a permanent feature of our mind.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">God has not forgotten</div>
<div class="line">To give us peace.</div>
<div class="line">He is just waiting for us</div>
<div class="line">To ask for it.</div>
</div>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p><strong>2. Inner Peace is to be experienced Here and Now.</strong></p>
<p>It is a mistake to feel inner peace will be achieved in the future, when circumstances are more favourable. Inner peace can only be felt in the present moment. If we live only in the here and now, we will not worry about the future, or speculate on the past. If we live only for the present moment we can learn to understand the immediacy of inner peace.</p>
<p><strong>3. Inner peace and Oneness are inseparable.</strong></p>
<p>If we live in the critical mind and are constantly judging others, we will never experience real inner peace. When we judge others we try to assert our superiority over others, but this can never bring inner peace. When we are flooded with inner peace, we feel others are an extended part of our reality; the imperfection of others actually seem our own imperfections, just in another body.</p>
<p><strong>4. Inner Peace is in the heart not the Mind.</strong></p>
<p>To find inner peace in the mind, is difficult. The nature of the mind is to think, analyse and create problems. The nature of the heart is oneness, love and joy. If we can bring to the fore the qualities of the heart, we will find peace. It is also in the heart, that our Soul resides. The Soul is the divine part of our being, and is inundated with peace.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;To come back to the secret of inner peace, our questioning and doubting mind is always wanting in peace. Our loving and dedicated heart is always flooded with inner peace.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> <a class="reference" href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> [2]</p>
<p><strong>5. Inner Peace is Dynamic not Passive.</strong></p>
<p>Inner peace energises us. When we have a connection with inner peace, we spontaneously have a positive outlook on life. Inner peace is not a passive quality, it embodies great energy.</p>
<p><strong>6. Inner Peace and Meditation.</strong></p>
<p>If we feel inner peace remains a far cry, we should not despair. If we sincerely pray and meditate for inner peace we can achieve it. Our sincere aspiration for inner peace, is the most powerful tool for making it a living reality. We cannot expect to be flooded with inner peace if we make no effort to attain it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;To hope to achieve peace without spirituality or meditation is to expect water in the desert.&quot; [3]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. Peace does not Require an Escape from the world.</strong></p>
<p>Inner peace does not require us to live in an himalayan cave. Inner peace can be experienced in the hustle and bustle of the world. What is important is the state of our mind, not the outer circumstances.</p>

<div class="line-block"><a href="http://www.writespirit.net/blog/2007/03/11/secrets-happiness/do-you-always-want-to-happy-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-19249"><img class=" wp-image-19249 aligncenter" title="do-you-always-want-to-happy" src="http://www.writespirit.net/wp-content/uploads/old-images/do-you-always-want-to-happy1.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></div>
<p><strong>The Secrets of Happiness by Jogyata Dallas</strong></p>
<p>The quest for lasting happiness lies at the very heart of all human purpose and experience, though this much desired attainment is sought in many different ways. Among the ways that have proven successful a number of recurring themes are evident.</p>
<p>The perennial philosophies of our spiritual teachers urge self-perfecting, the inner way, while most of mankind is searching in the outer world ? right person, right possessions, right place.</p>
<div class="line-block"></div>
<p>Here are a few pointers that work:</p>
<div class="line-block"></div>
<p><strong>Start Within</strong></p>
<p>A huge wealth of highly credible literature and teachings concur that happiness is first of all an inner accomplishment, not just a series of circumstances. Prayer, contemplation, quiet time, simply sitting with peaceful music, the practice of inner stillness, all help in developing understanding, balance, an inner harmony and poise. Happiness arises out of these practices like the fragrance of a flower.</p>
<p><strong>Visualise Your Day</strong></p>
<p>Take five minutes at the start of each day to visualize what you intend to accomplish ? prepare the mind, your life energy, and burst into your day with vigour, intensity, calm resolve and joy. Every day we create our world with our mind ? our moods, emotions, attitudes and consciousness. Train the mind and fill it with inspiration and positive energies, self-faith, the bright colours of your heart and soul.</p>
<p><strong>Be Healthy</strong></p>
<p>Try to achieve excellent and enduring physical health through regular cardiovascular exercise and reasonable diet. The well-being of the body creates the foundations of a lasting happiness. Body, mind, heart, soul interconnect and impact on each other ? happiness is helped by physical well-being as well as by stress free living, simplicity, spiritual awakening. The body is the temple, the soul is the shrine, happiness the fragrance.</p>
<p><strong>Compassion and Kindness</strong></p>
<p>Practice kindness and acts of self-giving. When we use our good qualities to serve others, our good qualities multiply. When we neglect these and live only for ourselves, they wither. This is karma yoga, spirituality in action ? the ego is erased, the heart widens, our oneness with others expands and deepens. Happiness blossoms when we see and serve the divinity in everything around us.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>
<p>Try not to feel burdened by life or see yourself as frail and vulnerable. See every trial and challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, triumph, and see yourself as having much undiscovered strength and capacity. Feel gratitude for your life ? for what you have and what you do not have, who you are and who you are not. Feel your life perfection and your own blossoming perfection. You are the soul and your talents and capacities are boundless ? it?s really true.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity is the shedding of everything that prevents our enlightenment. Our world dazzles us with endless enchantments ? we will be happy if we have more, if we acquire this, that. But simplicity brings a happiness that comes through having less, achieving desirelessness. For desires do not diminish through fulfillment but deepen and multiply. The more we get, the more we want. Simplicity is an inner achievement ? ?simplicity is an advanced course? as <a class="reference" href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> succinctly says.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Desire is a cord that binds us to the world ? simplicity severs the cord and brings detachment and freedom. According to the spiritual masters, the ultimate simplicity is the surrender of one?s self-determination to God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Heart Not Mind</strong></p>
<p>The mind plays a dominant role in our modern life and slowly fills up with the ambitions, ideas, hopes and expectations that eventually shape our lives. We superimpose upon the flowing stream of our life all the limiting impositions and plans of the mind, but often at the expense of our happiness. Learn to ?feel? your life?s direction rather than plan and change it; listen to the wisdom of the spiritual heart, not the cautious deliberations of the mind; and ?see? your way forward with intuition and instinct rather than create it with the mind?s limited intent. ?Living in the heart?, a gift earned through spiritual practice and simplicity, recognises our life?s deeper purpose and gives us the courage to follow this. The heart knows how to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Have a Sense of Humour</strong></p>
<p>Although our strong sense of ?I? and ?me? makes each of us the epicentre of our universe, six billion other ?I?s? and ?mes? are also out there at the centre of their universe, all playing the leading role in their own private drama-comedy. A sense of humour gives us a light touch and reminds us that, like characters in a play, our role will be over very soon, the curtain will fall and we?ll go back to the changing room (the soul?s world) to prepare for another part. Like Groundhog Day, we wake up every day of our life (and every life in our many incarnations) and confront the same personal reality and unresolved issues until we at last get it right ? and what ?getting it right? really means is something you have to discover for yourself. Smiling about all this both unburdens us and gives us inner calm ? helpful benefits in the torrid battlefield of life.</p>
<p><strong>Try Meditation</strong></p>
<p>I?m serious. One day, probably too late, you?ll wake up and realise that your lifelong pursuit of material things and nest building isn?t really working ? you?ve had some fun, done pretty well, but you?re feeling unfulfilled and a bit empty inside. That?s because this isn?t really what it?s all about and real happiness, permanent happiness, is instead about personal enlightenment, freedom from suffering and egotism, discarding the ignorance that hides our true nature. So life will keep hitting you hard until you realise this ultimately liberating truth. Meditation will awaken this inner knowledge, reconnect you with your essential spiritual nature, show you a ?way out? of the discontent of your life. If you are ready and sincerely willing to try, your inner progress will be your life?s true accomplishment and finally the measure of it?s real worth.</p>
<p>Test these guidelines in your own life &#8211; see for yourself if they work. But make a start, for as the Latin proverb goes &#8211; Aut tunc, aut nunquam &#8211; it was then or never?.</p>

<p><strong>The God of Wild Places By: Roger Chamberlain</strong></p>
<div class="float-left figure">

<p class="caption">Overlooking Lake Rydal</p>
</div>
<p>It seems to me that this is one of the great paradoxes of our time. As a race we have been struggling for millennia to tame the forces of nature and to make for ourselves a more comfortable life than our ancestors could have dreamed of, insulated and protected from the daily hardships they suffered just to get by. Yet, now that we can live divorced from those privations and wander at our leisure through a neat and controlled world of concrete, Plexiglas and carbon fibre, our urge to return to the wild and primal world of untamed nature in search of something indefinable, but at the same time powerfully attractive, is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>The mountaineer, the adventure racer, the desert explorer, the backpacker trekking in remote mountains or jungles- what is it they are seeking, and why are they seeking it in the extremes of nature and the elements? Undoubtedly there is some &quot;vital urge&quot; in us that thirsts for new and more intense sensations and experiences, even those potentially painful or arduous. But does this urge have its roots in something deeper, a spiritual longing or impulse from the soul?</p>
<p>Certainly the belief that God exists intrinsically in nature, in its objects and forces, has its origin in prehistory. Early religions worshipped physical things as individual Gods that must be appeased, and it was only thousands of years later that the view of God as a being above, and separate from nature and the world became prevalent. A synthesis of these views appeared in the Upanishadic spirituality of ancient India, with God (or Brahman) defined as a Supreme consciousness pervading all things &#8211; immanent in nature yet transcending nature, experienced as a presence in the perishable things of the physical world yet at the same time immortal, eternal and infinite.</p>
<p>The Isha Upanishad says of Brahman:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;That moves and That moves not; That is far and the same is near; That is within all this and That also is outside all this.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Vedic and Upanishadic seers derived their knowledge not merely from observing the outer world and theorising as to its origin or meaning, but by meditating to explore the inner nature and awaken the subtle ability to perceive the inner dimension of the world &#8211; that not revealed to the physical senses. The modern-day Indian spiritual teacher <a class="reference" href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> offers us a view which is accessible, simple and profound:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;The beauty of nature is the expression of the One who is all Beauty. Whenever we see something, we see inside that thing the inner presence, the inner consciousness, of its creator. The Creator of nature is God Himself. He expresses Himself in and through Nature. When we see nature&#8217;s beauty, we get overwhelming joy because the Creator and Owner is God. When we see a house, if we love the owner, we love the possession. The One who is all Beauty is inside His creation, like a mother&#8217;s heart is inside her child.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the western world, untamed nature was seen for centuries as a hostile force, a threat, and indeed this is understandable in the context of our ancestor&#8217;s lives as subsistence farmers or hunter-gatherers in harsh northern climes, at the mercy of extremes of weather and vulnerable if caught out &#8211; alone and isolated &#8211; in a remote forest or moorland. Only when sections of society had escaped this hand-to-mouth existence did we see the popularisation of the romantic view of nature as something &quot;sublime&quot;, inspiring or innately divine. This spiritually surcharged love and reverence for nature &#8211; especially for high mountains, rivers in spate and other glorious extremes, was expressed powerfully by poets such as <a class="reference" href="/authors/william_wordsworth">Wordsworth</a> and Shelley and also explored in the philosophy of Ruskin. <a class="reference" href="http://www.poetseers.org/the_romantics">The Romantic poets</a> led the way in expressing this newfound love of nature and it&#8217;s divine origin.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;How divine,</div>
<div class="line">The liberty, for frail, for mortal, man</div>
<div class="line">To roam at large among unpeopled glens</div>
<div class="line">And mountainous retirements . . .</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">. . . regions consecrate</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To oldest time! and, reckless of the storm</div>
<div class="line">That keeps the raven quiet in her nest,</div>
<div class="line">Be as a presence or a motion ? one</div>
<div class="line">Among the many there;&quot;</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"></div>
</div>
<p>Later the transcendentalist poetry of Whitman brought a forceful and dynamic expression to his descriptions of the world around him and its inherent divinity. While Wordsworth offers us a sensitive voice, awestruck by nature and irresistibly attracted to it&#8217;s divinity and power, Whitman seems to merge with that natural power, and it&#8217;s potency flows through his work giving it a compelling vibrancy and urgency:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;It is that something in the soul which says, Rage on, Whirl on, I tread master here and everywhere, Master of the spasms of the sky and of the shatter of the sea, Master of nature and passion and death, And of all terror and all pain.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>In quieter moments he urges us to join him on his quest:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first,</div>
<div class="line">Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop&#8217;d,</div>
<div class="line">I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.&quot;</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"></div>
</div>
<p>While poets have sought to articulate their belief in the divinity of nature in words, there are many who have expressed their attraction in a less cerebral but perhaps more compelling form. The mountaineers and explorers, whose &quot;golden age&quot; ran from the nineteenth into the twentieth century, may not have knowingly shared an ideal with the romantics and transcendentalist poets and the believers what became known as the &quot;doctrine of immanence&quot;. But we need look no further than the journals and letters of these great adventurers to see a clear parallel. Mallory, the climber who tried three times to conquer Everest and ultimately met his death on its upper slopes, famously explained his reason for climbing a mountain with the words &quot;because it&#8217;s there&quot;. Perhaps these words reveal no more than the simple fact that his true motivation was inexpressible. Along with the polar explorer Robert Scott, who also gave his life in the cause of pushing back the boundaries of exploration and human endeavour, Mallory felt an irresistible attraction in remote or wild places and, significantly, in taking on the immense and incredibly dangerous challenge of going where no human being had gone before. This urge to go beyond the limits of experiences already attained and to push ever onward and outward into the realms beyond is surely an outer expression of the inner, spiritual force within human beings. Some have suggested that this inner drive to transcend is the same force that drives our evolution, and has seen life on earth evolve from the simple protozoan, first to plant, then to animal and finally to reach its zenith &#8211; for the moment &#8211; in humanity.</p>
<p>The climbers and explorers of that golden age were often trained scientists. For many of them, undertaking research to expand the horizons of human knowledge was an important part of their motivation. Others had to at least pay lip service to this scientific cause, as it helped them gain the backing of the academic world when seeking to fund their quests to the South Pole or Himalayas. Often there was an uneasy relationship between those who sought only the answers to scientific riddles and those who saw some innate value in reaching the pole, the summit or the undiscovered land. A similar antagonism existed between the romantic poets and the rationalists who saw nature from a purely scientific or utilitarian viewpoint and were unable to understand or accept any reverence for nature as something sacred or divine.</p>
<p>Today we still see a clear divide between the &quot;scientism&quot; of the rationalists who accept only physical truth and the spiritually inspired view of those we might term &quot;seekers&quot;, who set more store by spiritual principles and inner wisdom that falls outside the narrow confines of biology or physics. The view of scientism appears to be that he physical reality is the only reality, the phenomenal world the totality of existence. Professor Martin Kemp reminds us of this viewpoint when he speaks of &quot;the mechanisation of the world view&quot;.</p>
<p>The spiritual person could argue that they have experienced first-hand another world, an inner world, and that this powerful and undeniable inner experience should not be excluded merely because the instruments of the scientist fail to detect it&#8217;s existence. <a class="reference" href="/authors/sri_aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a>, the spiritual teacher and seer poet of twentieth century India, sums up the spiritual view in a compelling anecdote from his time spent locked up alone in a cell in Alipore Jail as a prisoner of the British:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;They proved to me by convincing reasons that God does not exist; Afterwards I saw God, for he came and embraced me. And now what am I to believe- the reasoning of others or my own experience? Truth is what the soul has seen and experienced; the rest is appearance, prejudice and opinion.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>To return then, to our mountaineer, explorer, trekker and extreme sports enthusiast. Something is driving them to seek out new and powerful experiences in the quest for self-understanding, and something is driving them toward nature and the elements as a part of that quest.</p>
<p>To me this is undoubtedly a spiritual search &#8211; a rejection of the mundane as an unsatisfying and unfulfilling sphere of experience, which the seeker longs to transcend. This inner hunger can become so intense as to drive the unconscious seeker &#8211; the explorer, the climber, the extreme sportsman or sportswoman &#8211; to be reckless even with their own life. Again Sri Chinmoy offers us an insightful explanation of this unrequited longing from within:</p>
<p>&quot;The deer grows musk in his own body. He smells it and becomes enchanted, and tries to locate its source. He runs and runs, but he cannot find the source. In his endless search, he loses all his energy and finally he dies. But the source he was so desperately searching for was within himself. How could he find it elsewhere?</p>
<p>Such is the case with you. Your special mission ? which is the fulfilment of your divinity ? is not outside you, but within you. Search within. Meditate within. You will discover your mission.&quot;</p>
<p>For me, this clearly sums up the answer (to the rather nebulous questions with which I began this rambling essay). I began my own seeker-journey as a lover of nature, one who at times felt compelled to leave behind some of the twentieth century&#8217;s comforts and to live under canvas in the forest in search of some kind of answer to the questions of life. Later, when I discovered yogic philosophy and became consciously aware that the real answer must lie within, I turned to the path of meditation, just as those students of Upanishadic thought had done millennia before. A convergence, or synthesis, of both these approaches became clearly crystallised for me during a trek in the Huang Shan, or Yellow Mountains, of Anhui province in China.</p>
<div class="float-left figure">
<div class="image"><img alt="mountains" src="/image/richard/yellow.jpg" /></div>
<p class="caption">Yellow Mountains</p>
</div>
<p>With a group of friends from my meditation centre, I began the climb in the early morning mists of a cold, wet Chinese winter&#8217;s day. Eschewing the cheap but unexciting ride in a cable car, we made our ascent on the old stone steps of a path trodden by poets, artists and ordinary adventurers for many centuries. As we gained height, we were treated to tantalising glimpses of the exquisite peaks above us as the chill wind momentarily cleared away the heavy mist, only to bring it swirling back around us moments later. Finally we found ourselves above the mist and cloud, emerging into clear and impossibly bright sunshine among dramatic mountains that seemed to form some sculpted expression of a classical heaven. After reaching the summit of the Lotus Flower, the reigning peak of the Yellow Mountains, we headed downward on a sinuous path between pine-clad slopes and precipitous cliffs, towards the Bridge of the Immortals &#8211; a famous stone structure spanning a narrow chasm between two shear mountain faces.</p>
<p>As the path descended we came suddenly to a rocky platform with expansive vies into a valley filled with rock y pinnacles Standing like islands in a swirling sea of cloud. It seemed too beautiful to be real &#8211; the silence and the drama of the scene took our breath away. &quot;Okay, lets meditate here,&quot; said our de facto leader, but he spoke for all of us. We made ourselves comfortable on the ground, on rocks, or on a simple stone bench at the trailside, and meditated undisturbed to our heart&#8217;s content. The mist flowed slowly around the pinnacles like an ebbing tide; the sunlight seemed to radiate from every atom of the sky. In those moments, God&#8217;s mystical presence and profound peace came to us, in sky and mountain, in swirling cloud and silent stone. He was within all this. He was within us. Immanent, transcendence, all-where.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the continued presence of religious fanaticism and bigotry in the word, the twentieth century has witnessed a significant growth in religious tolerance. The idea that different religions and spiritual traditions have a valid approach is more widespread than at any time. To a large extent up until the 19th Century a defining feature of religion was the idea of the one true religion, and through its adherence you were either saved or damned. There was little if any ecumenical tradition and views of other religions were often clouded in myth, superstition or even contempt.</p>
<p>However the ideal of religious harmony is however increasingly shared by many. A crucial event in shaping a more pluralistic, tolerant view of religions was the inaugural World Parliament of Religions in 1893.</p>
<p>As part of the Chicago exhibition it was decided to invite participants from all the main religions. Some suggest the Parliament was founded in the expectation of proving the superiority of Christianity over the other religions. This may or may not have been a partial motive, but the idea of inviting representative from different religions was a relative novel concept and an outreach towards greater tolerance.</p>
<p>The World Parliament of Religions could possibly have passed into relative anonymity had it not been for the participation of the young Hindu monk <a class="reference" href="/authors/swami_vivekananda/biography-swami-vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>. Vivekananda was a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna a great saint from Bengal, India. Under his guidance Vivekananda had learnt, practised and embodied the ancient ideals of Vedanta. Foremost Sri Ramakrishna was a devotee of Mother Kali, but after realising the highest spiritual experience in his own sadhana (spiritual discipline) he was inspired to practise with great devotion, the religious and spiritual  disciplines of other religions and sects. Thus Ramakrishna was able to proclaim with the inner certainty of direct experience that all religions led to the same goal. For Ramakrishna the unity of all religions was not just a philosophical idea it was something he had realised and experienced himself.</p>
<p>As the spiritual successor to Ramakrishna it was fitting that Vivekananda would be able to make such a positive impression on the Parliament of World Religions.</p>
<p>In Vivekananda the audience felt a sincere spirituality a religious feeling that was not confrontational but all-inclusive. At his inaugural address Vivekananda began his immortal address with the words</p>
<p>?sisters and brothers of America?? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Spontaneously the 4,000 audience rose to their feet in appreciation for the sentiments and spirit of his lofty message. Vivekananda continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>
?It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<p>Swami Vivekananda was chosen to represent <a class="reference" href="/religious_traditions/hinduism">Hinduism</a> however he did not try to prove the superiority of his religion. Instead Vivekananda spoke with great sincerity about the harmony of world religions and the common spirituality of humanity. It was this universal message of oneness which captivated the audience.</p>
<blockquote><p>
?As different streams, having their sources in different places, all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Vivekananda proved to be an eloquent exponent of Vedanta and the ideals of all religions. In addition people felt in this handsome and striking Monk a calm detachment, a luminous personality and genuine spirituality. Unexpectedly Vivekananda proved to be the star of the World Parliament of Religions</p>
<p>100 years later another World Parliament of Religions was held in Chicago. The aim was to commemorate the historic Parliament 100 years ago and also to renew the commitment to interfaith dialogue. Since then there have also been Parliaments convened in Cape Town 1999 and Barcelona 2004. In Chicago and Barcelona the opening meditation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2" name="id2">[2]</a> was led by Sri Chinmoy. Speaking of his meditations Sri Chinmoy said</p>
<blockquote><p>
?During my Opening Meditation I am praying for the oneness of all religions.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Vivekananda, Sri Chinmoy comes from India and since his arrival in United States in 1964 he has sought to spread a message of unity and oneness between people of different faiths. Sri Chinmoy is also the founder of the World Harmony Run; a global relay run seeking to offer a dynamic way of bringing people together in harmony and oneness.</p>
<p>To <a class="reference" href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> religious tolerance is of great importance but also suggests tolerance is not the highest ideal, we can go beyond tolerance to feel a oneness and sympathy with other religions in the knowledge all religions are a reflection of the Ultimate Truth</p>
<blockquote><p>
?? I fully agree that all religions lead to one truth, the Absolute truth. There is One truth. There is only one Goal, but there are various paths. Each religion is right in its own way.?</p></blockquote>

<p>Many spiritual seekers in the past have felt that suffering and spiritual progress are inexorably linked. There are numerous examples of great saints who went through tremendous physical suffering during their life. For example St Teresa of Avila, St Francis of Assisi and many others suffered with painful illnesses throughout their life. In the Mahabharata we come across  Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas. She used to pray to <a class="reference" href="/religious_traditions/hinduism/sri_krishna">Lord Krishna</a> that she would always suffer so that she would be inclined to always think of him. When she was happy she said she would forget about Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>It seems a paradox that a God who embodies infinite love, and inner ecstasy should require a seeker to suffer in order to realise him.</p>
<p>However although some saints have made great progress despite physical suffering it would be wrong to think that suffering is necessary or even desirable. As <a class="reference" href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
?If suffering comes, we have to face it; we have to accept it as an experience on our way. But we do not have to add to our suffering in order to make further progress. We do not have to glorify suffering in order to make higher progress. I don&#8217;t have to cut off my arms or my nose in order to go to my Eternal Father. I don&#8217;t have to prove to Him how much I have suffered in order to reach Him. He is my all-loving Father and I have to approach Him with all my love. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>To get closer to God we need to raise our consciousness from our ordinary human consciousness to the divine consciousness. In the highest transcendental consciousness we aspire to there is no thought or emotion only a divinely fulfilling peace. If we are encumbered with negative thoughts and feel miserable because of an illness we will not be able to access this sublime consciousness. We should view suffering as an obstacle rather than something to be welcomed.</p>
<blockquote><p>
?We can easily do without it. If it comes, of course, we shall try to transform it with our inner light so that it can eventually be an added strength. But we shall not invoke it.? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2" name="id2">[2]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If suffering comes then it is the right approach to try to alleviate our suffering where possible. However although it is good to prayer for good health there is an even higher prayer, which is to accept our fate with equanimity. We shall pray for healing but if it is God?s will that we suffer then we should not be depressed by this experience. The great Saints were able to make progress because they were able to transform suffering into ecstasy. St John of the Cross recounts how even though he was suffering physical torture his divine experiences left him in an inner state of bliss. If we are able to identify with the soul rather than just the body we will be able to transcend our experiences of suffering. However when we are a beginner to the spiritual life this may be difficult. It is only advanced saints and mystics who are able to transform suffering into ecstasy.</p>
<p>When <a class="reference" href="/authors/sri_ramakrishna">Sri Ramakrishna</a> was suffering with throat cancer his disciples asked him,</p>
<blockquote><p>
?Why do you not pray to the Divine Mother for the cure of your illness??</p></blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?When I think of my Mother, the physical body vanishes, and I am entirely out of it. So it is impossible for me to pray for anything concerning the body&#8230;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Mother has brought this illness on me in order to teach man how to think of the Spirit and how to live in God-consciousness, even when there is extreme pain in the body. When he body is suffering from excruciating pain and starvation, and when it is beyond all human power to give any relief, even then the Mother shows me that Spirit is the Master of the body.? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3" name="id3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However for aspiring seekers the most important thing to remember is that if we wish to experience realisation of our Source cherishing unhappiness and suffering will not help in any way. When we are unhappy we are far from a divine consciousness.</p>
