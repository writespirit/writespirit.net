				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I came across a book written about Mother Teresa, entitled, A Simple Path. The book was compiled by Lucinda Vardey, in 1995. It shares with the reader stories about the work done by the sisters of the Missionaries of Charity Order, under the then direction of Mother Teresa. It contains several prayers which I felt are worth sharing. The first one which is really a poem, is apparently displayed on a sign on the wall of a children’s home in Calcutta, it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take time to think<br />
Take time to pray<br />
Take time to laugh</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is the source of power<br />
It is the greatest power on earth<br />
It is the music of the soul</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take time to play<br />
Take time to love and be loved<br />
Take time to give</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is the secret of perpetual youth<br />
It is God’s given privilege<br />
It is too short a day to be selfish</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take time to read<br />
Take time to be friendly<br />
Take time to work</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is the fountain of wisdom<br />
It is the road to happiness<br />
It is the price of success<br />
Take time to do charity<br />
It is the key to Heaven.</p>
<p>This poem contains a fairly simple message, always try to remain childlike. Laugh, play, give and be friendly. Try to live more from the heart and less in the mind. Yet it also demands something of us. Take the time (or make the time!) to do these things. Some of them, such as laughing and being friendly, are pretty easy for most of us, but what about prayer? How many of us make the time to consciously pray for the betterment of others, for peace in the world, for love and friendship to be the norm in our communities? Some studies have apparently proven real positive results of prayer. For example in the area of health, praying for a loved one has been shown to increase the rate of recovery from some serious illnesses. Even without any thought of personal gain, selfless prayer probably does makes us happier, and is an easy way for us to do something positive.</p>
<p><span id="more-19304"></span></p>
<p>The next poem from the books is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The fruit of silence is prayer<br />
The fruit of prayer is faith<br />
The fruit of faith is love<br />
The fruit of love is service<br />
The fruit of service is peace.</p>
<p>Meditation seems to be a way of finding inner silence, and peace of mind. Apparently in America over 1 million people regularly practice meditation! Silence increases faith in spirituality and lessens the belief that matter is the only reality. (Some teachers suggest the two may actually be the same). Being silent often leads to a deep inner feeling of divine love, which normally can’t be accessed due to the constant workings of the mind. The sisters of charity, serve the poorest of the poor through that divine love which they feel in their silence. If they can do this and achieve peace of mind then they really have achieved something unique and special, because the work they do, treating terrible illness, death and poverty, would seem to be most difficult.<br />
Mother Teresa says, &#8216;Everybody has something good inside them, some hide it, some neglect it, but it is there.</p>

<p>The writings delve into the fundamental questions of life, our soul, and God. The essays engage with questions man has frequently grappled to understand &#8211; with a simple and direct approach. Kalatit writes on these topics of spirituality and the meaning of life with good humour and a refreshingly light touch. The book is an enjoyable way to understand the promptings of our soul!</p>
<p>Kalatit explains his choice of title. When a friend heard he was going to write 100 essays, she replied:</p>
<p>“Why not 95, like Martin Lutherʼs Theses?”<br />
“Iʼll do him one better,” I boldly replied, “and attempt 96!”<br />
Hence, this collection and itʼs odd title.</p>

<h4>Brief Extract from Book</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;And it is our own souls that carry this fight into the Earthly arena, which, considering our lifeʼs brief span and the magnitude of the mission, not only casts victory very much in doubt but perhaps can even explain why theyʼre so anxious about the whole business, as demonstrated by their constant pestering for us to get back into the race; their incessant nagging via our conscience for us to do the right thing; to live a better, more righteous life. Which has also led some to hypothesize that pleadings this intense&#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad we get a most illumining description of the immortal Self and its primordial state of complete union with the all-pervading Divine consciousness.</p>
<p>In the Unitive state there is no suffering and pleasure, there is no birth and death; there is only a state of being.</p>
<p>At times the Self may incarnate in a certain body and have a dream like experience in and through this particular body. However whatever may befall this particular body, it is like a mere passing experience which leaves no lasting mark on the state of being.</p>
<p>Thus, when we feel I am hungry or I am in pain, what we really mean is that this particular body is hungry, this body has taken on the experience of pain. In ordinary life we perceive ourselves to be in a body, with a thinking mind and human emotion. But, this is not the real Self. At this point, the immortal words of the Bhagavad Gita throw light on the difference between the material world of impermanence and the Self&#8217;s reality of absolute permanence</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Even as man discards old clothes for the new ones, so the dweller in the body, the soul, leaving aside the worn-out bodies, enters into new bodies. The soul migrates from body to body. Weapons cannot cleave it, nor fire consume it, nor water drench it, nor wind dry it.&quot; [1]</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the Upanishads reveal that the nature of the Unitive state is beyond sex; it is neither male nor female, but contains the essence of both polarities in perfect harmony. Within the Self there is no concept of man made morality, good and evil do no exist. The Unitive state is in all; everything is but a dream of God, the all-pervading consciousness. To an un-illumined seeker, these concepts may be hard to grasp, for if we live in the world of duality, it is not possible to avoid such concepts. Yet, the Upanishads do not shrink from unveiling the supreme mystery of life, which is: what is the nature of God, my real Self?</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;In that Unitive state one sees without seeing, for there is nothing separate from him; smells without smelling, for there is nothing separate from him; speaks without speaking, for there is nothing separate from him; knows without knowing for there is nothing separate from him.&quot; [2]</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Unitive state negative emotions of anger, hate, jealousy and anxieties cannot occur. How can we be jealous of our own Self? How is it possible to hate the Self which offers only unconditional love. How is it possible to be anxious when nothing can affect the intense delight of being?</p>
<p>Furthermore other Upanishads tell us that the essence of this unitive state is infinite and unalloyed bliss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;From Delight we came into existence.</p>
<p>In Delight we grow.</p>
<p>At the end of our journey&#8217;s close,</p>
<p>Into Delight we retire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>The intense inner ecstasy of this state of being can never be described in words. But, when we gain a glimpse of this consciousness we will never feel desire for the pleasures of this world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people who are on a journey of self-discovery were introduced to the possibility through reading a book which opened their eyes and made them realise there was something deeper to life than what we see on the surface.</p>
<p>For many people, reading these books marked the starting of their inner quest in earnest, and set off a chain of events which might even have led to them pursuing an altogether different path than the one suggested in the book; nevertheless reading the book was a crucial stepping-stone that helped them to become aware that there was more to life than what just lay on the surface.</p>
<p>The term &#8216;life-changing book&#8217; is all to often little more than publisher&#8217;s blurb nowadays, but there are a few books for whom this claim has held true over the years:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>The Little Prince</strong> &#8211; Antoine de Saint-Exupery</li>
<li><strong>The Alchemist</strong> &#8211; Paolo Coelho</li>
</ul>
<p>These two books have a very childlike feel to them, but this childlike form lends itself for use as an allegory for bigger and deeper questions. Most memorable quote from the Little Prince: &quot;<em>It is only with the hear that one can see properly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.</em>&quot;</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Autobiography of A Yogi: Paramhansa Yogananda</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This book is one of the most widely-read accounts of Eastern philosophy available. In this book, the author describes his childhood spiritual experiences and remerkable spiritual figures that he has met. In particular, the chapters where he describes the guidance he recieved from his teacher, Sri Yukteshwar, is one of the best accounts of the meditation teacher-student relationship available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Siddhartha &#8211; Herman Hesse</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A reworking of the tale of how the young prince Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha, or the enlightened one. After embracing the extremes of austerity and luxury, the prince attains enlightenment throuth the middle path.
