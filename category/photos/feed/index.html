<h3>Prayer</h3>
<p >Great God, I ask for no meaner pelf<br />
   Than that I may not disappoint myself,<br />
   That in my action I may soar as high<br />
  As I can now discern with this clear eye.</p>
<p>And next in value, which thy kindness lends,<br />
   That I may greatly disappoint my friends,<br />
   Howe&#8217;er they think or hope that it may be,<br />
   They may not dream how thou&#8217;st distinguished me.</p>
<p>That my weak hand may equal my firm faith<br />
   And my life practice what my tongue saith<br />
   That my low conduct may not show<br />
   Nor my relenting lines<br />
   That I thy purpose did not know<br />
   Or overrated thy designs.</p>

<h3>Because I could not stop for Death</h3>
<p>by: Emily Dickinson  </p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >Because I could not stop for Death,<br />
   He kindly stopped for me;<br />
   The carriage held but just ourselves<br />
  And Immortality. </p>
<p>We slowly drove, he knew no haste,<br />
   And I had put away<br />
   My labour, and my leisure too,<br />
   For his civility.</p>
<p>We passed the school where children played,<br />
   Their lessons scarcely done;<br />
   We passed the fields of gazing grain,<br />
   We passed the setting sun.</p>
<p>We paused before a house that seemed<br />
   A swelling of the ground;<br />
   The roof was scarcely visible,<br />
   The cornice but a mound.</p>
<p>Since then &#8217;tis centuries; but each<br />
   Feels shorter than the day<br />
   I first surmised the horses&#8217; heads<br />
   Were toward eternity.</p>

<p>Gaya is located at a distance of 105 km from Patna in the state of Bihar. Buddha Gaya is located 7 miles south of Gaya and is one of the well visited Buddhist pilgrimage centers of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;The Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment is considered to be the among the oldest and the most venerated tree in the world. This tree is said to be a descendant of the original tree, a branch of which was transplanted at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka during the period of Emperor Ashoka the great.  It is believed that Emperor Ashoka&#8217;s Guru Upagupta led him to various holy sites in the Buddhist tradition, including this tree at Gaya. &quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modern life with all its distractions and features seems  particularly unsuited to silence. Even if we have actual outer silence our mind  is rarely silent. If we analyse our thoughts there seem to be a never ending  stream of worries, anxieties, and regrets. </p>
<p>In meditation we try to do a very difficult thing &#8211; silence  our thoughts completely. It is difficult only because we are so unused to this  idea. The mind is so used to thinking that it is easy to think our existence is  defined by our thoughts and this must be our only existence. To quote the  famous saying of Descartes &ldquo;I think therefore I am&rdquo;<br />
  However meditation teaches that what we are is unencumbered  by thoughts. The real &ldquo;I&rdquo; is our self which is beyond thought.</p>
<p>There is an interesting exercise to prove this. Whenever a  thought arises in the mind, ask yourself where is the origination of this  thought? This leads you to part of yourself which is beyond thought. Also be  aware of the fact that you can choose which thought to accept and which to  reject. This again shows us that what we are, is not our thoughts. There is  some inner self which can decide whether to pursue thoughts or not. It is when  we are able to stop thoughts entering our mind that we will start to experience  real silence. This technique of meditation on the question &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; was  particularly recommended by Spiritual Master <a href="/authors/ramana_maharshi">Ramana Maharshi</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Silence of Meditation</h4>
<p>The silence of meditation is not just quietness. It embodies  a dynamic and vast consciousness far beyond our usual experience of everyday  life. It is in this mental silence that we can access our own hidden  consciousness. By silence we really mean the silence of the mind. </p>
<p class="quote"> &ldquo;Silence is not silent. Silence speaks. It speaks  most eloquently. <br />
Silence is not still. Silence leads. It leads  most perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &#8211; <a href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Difficulties in achieving Silence</h4>
<p>A difficulty we face in experiencing silence in the mind is  that part of us is uncertain what will happen. It is like stepping into the  unknown, this fear of the unknown keeps us from diving deep into our  meditation. To experience the silence of meditation it is necessary to give up  worries about the future, regrets about the past. It is also necessary to give  up our own notions of what we are. We have to feel the need for giving up these  negative qualities and suspending the judgement of the mind. If we can  experience the silence of <a href="/resources/meditation">meditation</a> it is liberating because unencumbered by  our own thoughts we can make ourselves receptive to the inner peace of our own  soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence tells the seeker in us to  love, to love himself. It tells us it is wrong to hate ourselves because of our  imperfections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Silence is experienced in the Heart.</h4>
<p>When we meditate we can try focus our sense of awareness in  the heart. When we talk about the heart in meditation we are actually referring  to the spiritual heart. This is a Chakra or energy centre. We have <a href="/spirituality/kundalini/the_seven_chakras">seven of  these charkas</a> and they are explained in Hindu, Buddhist and other scriptures.  If we concentrate on the spiritual heart, which is located in the centre of the  chest near the physical heart, then over time we will feel a physical sensation  like a rotating disc. This is a good sign. It is in the heart that it is  easiest to silence the mind. The heart has a power of its own. The nature of  the heart is not to judge, think or criticise. The qualities of the heart  embody vastness, oneness and love. It is here that we can experience silence  most effectively.</p>

<p> &quot;Unaspiring human beings do not enlist the help of                             time. They do not know the value of time They think                             that achievement is of paramount importance, and not                             the time required for the achievement. So they do not                             care for time; they neglect time. They do not realise                             that time is the bridge that will carry them to the                             other shore. If they do not use the bridge, they cannot                             go on to the other shore where there is Light, Peace                             and Bliss in boundless measure. But the aspiring person,                             the seeker, appreciates time and utilises it. When it                             is time to eat, he will eat; when it is time to think,                             he will think; when it is time to study spiritual books,                             he will study; and when it is time to rest, he will                             rest. For him, each day is a new challenge, a new opportunity.                             He enters into the battlefield of life to conquer darkness,                             limitation, bondage and death. He has to fight and rest                             at the appropriate times. He has to do all the things                             that are necessary to invoke Peace, Light and Bliss                             from above in infinite measure so that he can bring                             to the fore his inner divinity and offer it to the world                             at large.&quot;</p>

<p>Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks. By nightfall on the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went out. The first monk said, &quot;Oh, no! The candle is out.&quot; The second monk said, &quot;Aren&#8217;t we not suppose to talk?&quot; The third monk said, &quot;Why must you two break the silence?&quot; The fourth monk laughed and said, &quot;Ha! I&#8217;m the only one who didn&#8217;t speak.&quot;</p>

<p>It reminds me of another Zen story where a monk is only allowed to speak once every 10 years.</p>
<p>After first 10 years novice monk says &quot;food cold&quot;</p>
<p>After second 10 years novice monk says &quot;bed hard&quot;</p>
<p>After thirty years monk says &quot;Food still cold bed still hard I&#8217;m leaving&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of the Monastery says</p>
<p>&quot;Thats OK all he ever did was complain..&quot;</p>

<p>I Like these Zen stories because they make us think and smile at the same time</p>
