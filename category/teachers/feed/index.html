<p><a class="reference" href="/authors/swami_satchidananda">Swami Satchidananda</a> is a respected yoga teacher, who studied under the Spiritual Master Swami Sivananda. In this short extract Swami Satchidanada offers a spiritual approach to breaking bad habits</p>
<div class="section" id="how-can-you-trick-your-mind-into-breaking-a-bad-habit">
<h3><a name="how-can-you-trick-your-mind-into-breaking-a-bad-habit">How can you trick your mind into breaking a bad habit?</a></h3>
<p>How can you trick your baby so you can take away something that would hurt it? Suppose the baby is playing with something sharp. What kind of trick would you use? You would give her something nice to distract her.</p>
<p>In the same way, find some nice positive habits. Present them to the mind. Admire them ?Oh, look how terrific this habit is. So useful. Something to be proud of.? Certainly your little baby mind will jump to grab it. As soon as it jumps for the good habit, take away the bad one.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to be rid of bad company, what should you do? Just get into good company; the bad company will automatically stay away. It?s simple. You won?t be available to the bad people because you will always be mingling with good people. That?s a very good beginning toward a very high goal. Sir Patanjali calls it pratipaksha bhavanam ? substituting positive thoughts for negative ones. Think of the opposite, develop the opposite. If you have hatred, develop love. That is the trick. You cannot simply beat the darkness, telling it to get out. Instead, just bring in a candle. Without even saying goodbye, the darkness will run away.</p>

<h2>Quotes by Yogananda </h2>
<p>  &#8216;To meditate truly is to concentrate solely on spirit. This is  esoteric meditation. It is the highest form of activity that man  can perform,  and it is the most balanced way to find GOD.&#8217; </p>
<p> &#8216;Every day undertake something that is difficult for you and try  to do it. Though you fail 5 times, keep on, and as soon as you have  succeeded in that direction, apply your concentrated will on  something else. You will thus be able to accomplish increasingly  greater things. Will is the instrument of the image of God  within you.&#8217; </p>
<p>
&#8216;HE who is persistent will realize God. So try your best to make meditation a regular experience in your life.&#8217; </p>
<p>&#8216;TO be able to concentrate is essential for spiritual progress; without concentration you shall never find God.                Learn how to shut out of your consciousness all sounds and other earthly distractions.&#8217; </p>

</div>
<p>Karnataka Governor T.N. Chaturvedi was present at the release of the 400-page book compiled by a team led by Prof. Laxminarayana, a former Dean of Commerce of Osmania University. The book is titled &quot;Face-to-Face with Sri Ramana Maharshi&quot;. The programme was organised by Sri Ramana Kendram.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaturvedi said the book, for which he had written the foreword, made the readers emotionally attached to Ramana Maharshi&#8217;s literature. He said there were a number of stories about the Maharshi although he was self-absorbed with spirituality. Mr. Chaturvedi was past president of Ramana Kendram, New Delhi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="/authors/swami_vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a> was a spiritual genius of commanding intellect. Exhorting the nation to spiritual greatness, he awakened India to a new national consciousness. He was the founder of the Ramakrishna Mutt and Mission to spearhead the teachings of his spiritual guru, Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Vivekananda was a guiding spirit to the youth and his teachings remain an inspiration.</p>
<p>Shri Aravind Ghose, popularly known as <a href="/authors/sri_aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a> was the first of the national leaders to insist on full independence for India as the goal of the nationalist movement, besides lending all his energies to the freedom struggle.</p>
