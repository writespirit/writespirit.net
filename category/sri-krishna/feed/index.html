<blockquote><p>
&quot;Sri Krishna was a teacher from the very beginning of his life. Even before he entered into the physical world he acted as a teacher. Before he entered into his mother&#8217;s womb, he came to his father who had been imprisoned by the king and said, &quot;I am now going to enter into the physical world. As soon as I am born, you will take me out of this prison-cell and take me to Nanda&quot; (one of his relatives). His father saw Sri Krishna vividly before he came into the world of manifestation, and to everybody&#8217;s surprise, all of a sudden all the doors and gates of the prison were wide open, and his father took him to Nanda&#8217;s place. Here he started his teaching.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Sri Krishna  </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;God is proud of His Divinity in Sri Krishna. <br />
  Man is proud of his humanity in Sri Krishna. </p>
<p>  Sri Krishna is the beloved Boatman who untiringly plies His Boat of Consciousness <br />
  between India&#8217;s unparalleled history and Her unrivalled spirituality. </p>
<p>  The Gita is Sri Krishna&#8217;s Heart, His Vision-in-Fulfilment. <br />
  The Gita is humanity&#8217;s breath, its journey towards Immortality. </p>
<p>  Sri Krishna&#8217;s Flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. <br />
  Sri Krishna&#8217;s Gita enchants the Transcendental Consciousness. </p>
<p>  Sri Krishna plays on His Flute. We hear. We do something more. <br />
  We barter our body&#8217;s dust with His Soul&#8217;s Plenitude. </p>
<p>  Sri Krishna is the shoreless ocean of Bliss. <br />
  But as soon as I sincerely dedicate myself to Him,<br /> <br />
  He presents me with His own Boat and takes me to the boundless Shore, <br />
  the Golden All.&#8221;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Krishna is the  matchless hero who held the fate of the emperors in the palm of his  hand but himself never desired a throne. <br />
  The great hero who was born in  a prison and died in solitude in a forest. <br />
  He gave the world the <a title="The Bhagavad Gita" href="/religious_traditions/hinduism/sri_krishna/the_bhagavad_gita/" target="_self">Bhagavad- Gita</a>.<br /> <br />
  He is the architect of Dharma who lives forever in the hearts of the people of India and the whole world.&quot;</p>
