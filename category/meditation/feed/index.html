<p><em>&quot;No matter which path you follow for meditation, the first and foremost task is to try to make the mind calm and quiet. &quot;</em></p>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>Beginners to meditation find that when they sit down to meditate their mind is akin to a mad monkey; no matter how hard we try, the power of the mind&#8217;s thoughts seem to make meditation most difficult. However, it is possible to have a completely clear mind. It is not easy, but there are various techniques that can be used to quieten the mind. These are some techniques that I recommend.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Source of Thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a thought appears in your mind, ask yourself &#8211; where did this thought originate from? Try to dive deep into the source of this thought. When you follow the source of your thoughts you realise that our real essence is not mental thoughts; there is something beyond thought. This is a powerful technique for calming our mind because we realise there is a separation between what we are and our thoughts. When we feel thoughts as separate from our identity it is easy to stop them completely.</p>
<p><strong>2. Will Power.</strong></p>
<p>Another technique to stop thoughts is to use the power of our will. Develop the determination to stop all thoughts completely. Feel like you are vigilantly guarding your mind. As soon as a thought appears stop it entering. If you like you can imagine throwing it out of your mind completely. The important thing is to not allow any thought, whether good or bad.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Spiritual Heart</strong></p>
<p>A most effective technique for reducing the power is to move our awareness from the mind to the heart. The mind, by nature, invites thoughts, The heart is the seat of the soul; it is in the heart where we can feel an expansive quality, not limited by the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;The mind has its own power, and right now this power is stronger than your present eagerness and determination to meditate. But if you can get help from your heart, then gradually you will be able to control your mind. The heart, in turn, gets constant assistance from the soul, which is all light and all power.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<p>The nature of the heart is to identify with a meditative consciousness. In the heart thoughts will automatically lose their power. To enter the heart we can listen to the heart beat. We can also imagine a beautiful heart garden. The important thing is to feel our whole sense of awareness leaving our mind and entering into the heart.</p>
<p><strong>4. Mantra.</strong></p>
<p>Repeating a mantra many times creates a meditative vibration. It focuses the mind in a very direct way; the mind gets used to concentrating on one particular thing at a time. When our mantra ends, our mind will be clearer and more receptive to meditation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>The real secret to a quiet mind is a genuine aspiration to realise the benefits of meditation. If we are satisfied with what we have and what we are, we will not feel the necessity of diving deep within. However, if we feel the necessity of discovering our inner reality, we will have the motivation and enthusiasm for persevering with our meditation. This is important, because, when our aspiration is intense it brings down a grace from above; it is this grace which makes a silent mind much easier to achieve.</p>

<p>Modern life with all its distractions and features seems  particularly unsuited to silence. Even if we have actual outer silence our mind  is rarely silent. If we analyse our thoughts there seem to be a never ending  stream of worries, anxieties, and regrets. </p>
<p>In meditation we try to do a very difficult thing &#8211; silence  our thoughts completely. It is difficult only because we are so unused to this  idea. The mind is so used to thinking that it is easy to think our existence is  defined by our thoughts and this must be our only existence. To quote the  famous saying of Descartes &ldquo;I think therefore I am&rdquo;<br />
  However meditation teaches that what we are is unencumbered  by thoughts. The real &ldquo;I&rdquo; is our self which is beyond thought.</p>
<p>There is an interesting exercise to prove this. Whenever a  thought arises in the mind, ask yourself where is the origination of this  thought? This leads you to part of yourself which is beyond thought. Also be  aware of the fact that you can choose which thought to accept and which to  reject. This again shows us that what we are, is not our thoughts. There is  some inner self which can decide whether to pursue thoughts or not. It is when  we are able to stop thoughts entering our mind that we will start to experience  real silence. This technique of meditation on the question &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; was  particularly recommended by Spiritual Master <a href="/authors/ramana_maharshi">Ramana Maharshi</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Silence of Meditation</h4>
<p>The silence of meditation is not just quietness. It embodies  a dynamic and vast consciousness far beyond our usual experience of everyday  life. It is in this mental silence that we can access our own hidden  consciousness. By silence we really mean the silence of the mind. </p>
<p class="quote"> &ldquo;Silence is not silent. Silence speaks. It speaks  most eloquently. <br />
Silence is not still. Silence leads. It leads  most perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &#8211; <a href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Difficulties in achieving Silence</h4>
<p>A difficulty we face in experiencing silence in the mind is  that part of us is uncertain what will happen. It is like stepping into the  unknown, this fear of the unknown keeps us from diving deep into our  meditation. To experience the silence of meditation it is necessary to give up  worries about the future, regrets about the past. It is also necessary to give  up our own notions of what we are. We have to feel the need for giving up these  negative qualities and suspending the judgement of the mind. If we can  experience the silence of <a href="/resources/meditation">meditation</a> it is liberating because unencumbered by  our own thoughts we can make ourselves receptive to the inner peace of our own  soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence tells the seeker in us to  love, to love himself. It tells us it is wrong to hate ourselves because of our  imperfections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Silence is experienced in the Heart.</h4>
<p>When we meditate we can try focus our sense of awareness in  the heart. When we talk about the heart in meditation we are actually referring  to the spiritual heart. This is a Chakra or energy centre. We have <a href="/spirituality/kundalini/the_seven_chakras">seven of  these charkas</a> and they are explained in Hindu, Buddhist and other scriptures.  If we concentrate on the spiritual heart, which is located in the centre of the  chest near the physical heart, then over time we will feel a physical sensation  like a rotating disc. This is a good sign. It is in the heart that it is  easiest to silence the mind. The heart has a power of its own. The nature of  the heart is not to judge, think or criticise. The qualities of the heart  embody vastness, oneness and love. It is here that we can experience silence  most effectively.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers led by Prashant Kaul of the University of Kentucky, investigated whether meditation could help people become less tired in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The students were asked to undergo a series of tests and then have their responses measured. The study found that alertness was the highest after meditation, followed by caffeine and then exercise. Napping had the worst results.</p>
<p>The findings of Prashant Kaul were recently submitted to a conference for the Society for Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that when meditating although people are awake their are similar brain patterns to sleeping.</p>
<p>Some adepts in meditation are known to need very little sleep having become able to draw in cosmic energy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inmates of Gwalior Central Jail recently had a day long session of taking lessons in spiritualism, relieving stress and how to shun violent tendencies by a visiting team of volunteers representing a New York based organisation.</p>
<p>The inmates serving various jail terms in the Gawlior Central Jail attended a six hour long session on spiritualism to develop and realise their inner selves. It was organised by the Krishna Bhavnamat Sangh, the New York based voluntary organisation.</p>
<p>The nearly six hour long session was attended by almost all of the 2,800 inmates. About 200 jail staff was also present during the programme.</p>
<p>The initiative was taken to make them learn how they can rehabilitate themselves in society after being released. Inmates were motivated to participate in spiritual meets to overcome emotional stress and sense of guilt.</p>
<p>A musical programme was also conducted in the jail premises.</p>
<p>&quot;We have conducted these spiritual meets in the jail at Agra and many prisoners have been able to change this lifestyle and outlook. Some prisoners were creating nuisance in the jail but it was spiritual interactions with us that changed their attitude. Those prisoners have started meditating for about eight hours a day,&quot; added Jankiram, Campaign Secretary of Krishna Bhavnamat Sangh.</p>
<p>Following this experimental spiritual programme, the prisoners serving jail terms beyond five years or serving life terms felt an urge to transform their lives.</p>
<p>It was hoped that the programme would help the inmates shun criminal tendencies and reorient their attitude and outlook in a positive way.</p>
<p>According to Jail officials, such programmes may be very helpful for the prisoners to think positive and reshape their lives.</p>
