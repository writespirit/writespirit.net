<p>Sister Madonna is a unique combination of Catholic nun and record setting triathlete. Her running career began late in life, when a priest encouraged her to take up running to help harmonise mind and body.</p>
<p>In 2005, Sister Madonna ran the 2005 Hawaii Ironman setting a record for the oldest women to finish an Ironman Triathlon. Sister Madonna is also a full time nun and is only able to train part-time. Altogether, Sister Madonna has completed 350 triathlons and 40 at the Ironman distance.</p>
<p>Sister Madonna has a simple philosophy for explaining her unique ultra distant events, in the evening of her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If we want to do it, we can. The only failure is not to try, because putting forth the effort is success in itself.”</p>
<p>“If life doesn’t have some challenges, it isn’t worth living, right?”</p>
<p>When asked what she would say to people who think they are too old to start exercising, she said, “If you’re not too young to start walking or running you’re not too old to stop…..no excuses!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nepal is celebrating after the historic peace accord between the government and rebel Maoists that ends 11 years of civil war. Different programs were held across the country including rallies. Friday&#8217;s programme in the capital Kathmandu was a continuation of the celebrations, but it had significant value.</p>
<p>A gigantic drum, dubbed the world peace drum, was beaten to send peace messages across the world. Thousands of spectators enjoyed the beating with the hope that peace will prevail in this land forever.</p>
<p>Organizers claimed this drum as world&#8217;s largest drum. According to Japanese drummer Hiromi Ishioka, coordinator of the world peace drum construction, the Guinness Book of World Records has recognized him as the maker of the world&#8217;s largest drum.</p>
<p>In a press conference held some five months ago in Kathmandu, he claimed that he will break his own record by making another super large drum.</p>

<h3>One Earth &#8211; 26000km &#8211; 2 years &#8211; 1 runner</h3>
</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesper Olsen is the first person to have successfully completed the unique feat of running around the world. Beginning on the 1st of January, 2004, from the Greenwich time  meridian in <em>London</em>;  Jesper successfully circumnavigated the world finishing nearly 2 years later in  October 2005, in London. During his epic run of 26,000 Km Jesper kept a detailed log and  even participated in local ultra distance runners. His extraordinary  experiences have now been produced into a book. It is an epic tale of self transcendence and inspiration to others &#8211; <a href="http://www.worldrun.org/">World Run </a></p>
<p>Jesper Olsen is now preparing for World Run 2 which could be over 40,000 Km </p>
<p>&ldquo;The route will in general lead from the Northern  point of Scandinavia and in Europe to the Southern tip of Africa. After this  first half of the total challenge is completed the run reverses direction and, hopefully,  continues North from the Southern tip of South America to the Northern point of  New Foundland in Canada, North America.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="line-block">

</div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy who is 75 years old lifts to inspire others that age need not be a barrier to achievement. Chinmoy also says the strength for his extraordinary lifts comes from his inner life of prayer and meditation. Asked about his message Sri Chinmoy says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Never give up! Never give up! Physical fitness is of paramount importance. There is no age limit<br />
when we live in the heart and when we try to be of prayerful and soulful service to God in the<br />
heart of humanity.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>World record breaker gets inspiration for 119th record.</p>
<p>Ashirta Furman, of Queens, N.Y., established a record for running a mile on tin pots earlier that afternoon, with a time of 18 minutes and 26 seconds. The pots were held against his shoes by hand-held strings. A stipulation of the record was that the tin pots musn&#8217;t fall off.</p>
<p>The record was set at POWNAL  Green Mountain Race Track on Friday 8th September. After setting and submitting a record it usually takes about 6 weeks for it to be ratified by Guiness.</p>
<p>Furman credits his study of meditation, under the tutelage of <a href="/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>, for his ability to break so many records.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in fun, but there&#8217;s a serious side because there&#8217;s physical conditioning and a lot of mental focus required,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You really have to focus deep within yourself. I really have to use the training I got from meditation to be very one-pointed and not allow other distractions to stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>
<p>Bipin Larkin, a friend of Furman&#8217;s, was present for the record attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s<br />
the spirit behind the thing that keeps you going, and it&#8217;s like an<br />
adventure,&#8221; said Larkin. &#8220;(Furman) believes in transcendence, in going<br />
beyond his restrictions.&#8221;</p>
