<p><em>&quot;For centuries the light of the Buddha has shone as a beacon beckoning men from across the sea of darkness. Like lost children, millions of seekers have reached out to the light with their heart&#8217;s inmost cry, and the Buddha has shown them the Way. The world stood before the Buddha with it&#8217;s ignorance, and the Buddha, the Enlightened One, gave man Truth. The world offered its age old suffering to the Buddha&#8217;s heart and the Buddha, Lord of Compassion, showed man the Dharma.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This week, Vietnam&#8217;s most famous exile has returned home &#8211; to lead prayers for the dead of a war that ended more than 30 years ago but still haunts the country.</p>
<p>He is an 80-year-old Buddhist monk who has lived outside the country for four decades, and massive crowds are expected to greet him everywhere he goes. Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh is Vietnam&#8217;s best-known peace activist and, after the Dalai Lama, is probably the most influential Buddhist spiritual leader in the world.</p>
<p>Like the Dalai Lama, he has spent half his life in exile. A best-selling author, he is feted in Europe and the US, but he was barred from his own land by the US-backed South Vietnamese government and the communist regime that displaced it.</p>
<p>It was Nhat Hanh who inspired the Rev Martin Luther King to come out publicly against the Vietnam War. He was a close personal friend of Thich Quang Duc, the Buddhist monk who captured the world&#8217;s attention when he burnt himself to death in front of television cameras in 1963 to protest against the persecution of Vietnam&#8217;s Buddhists.</p>
<p>But Nhat Hanh is not going home to lead any protests. The purpose of his visit, according to the monastery where he is based in France, is reconciliation. At the heart of the trip will be three huge prayer sessions for the dead of the war. His followers have called for people of all faiths to join with their own prayers, and even for atheist communists to read favourite passages from Marx.</p>

<p>Quite an interesting story, a little outdated now but still worth mentioning.</p>
<p>A young boy by the name of Ram Bomjan decided to meditate under a tree continuously for several months. His followers claimed that during this time he didn&#8217;t take any food or water. When his activities were observed by a Nepalese government team who gained permission to observe the boy continually for 48 hours. They found that to their amazement, he did remain rigid and focused in meditation.</p>
<p>Back in March he disappeared, perhaps because of all the interest he was receiving. Many locals believe he has gone to meditate in peace away from the glare of the media spotlight.</p>
<p>I feel the boy is genuine. That does not necessarily mean he is a reincarnation of the Buddha. But he seems an advanced soul who has practised meditation sincerly before. Whether he is eating or not. It is worth noting there are not many 16 year old boys who can still still motionless for 10 minutes. Let alone practically all day. His parents say as a young boy he had a particular strong sense of compassion for living creatures.</p>

&quot;The Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment is considered to be the among the oldest and the most venerated tree in the world. This tree is said to be a descendant of the original tree, a branch of which was transplanted at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka during the period of Emperor Ashoka the great.  It is believed that Emperor Ashoka&#8217;s Guru Upagupta led him to various holy sites in the Buddhist tradition, including this tree at Gaya. &quot;</p></blockquote>

<h3>I COBBLED THEIR BOOTS</h3>
<p></p>
<p>How could I love my fellow men who tortured me?</p>
<p>One night I was dragged into a room<br />
    And beaten near death with<br />
    their shoes</p>
<p>    striking me hundreds of times<br />
    in the face, scarring me<br />
    forever.</p>
<p>I cried out for God to help, until I fainted.</p>
<p>That night in a dream, in a dream more real than this world,<br />
    a strap from the Christ&rsquo;s sandal<br />
    fell from my bleeding<br />
    mouth,</p>
<p>    and I looked at Him and He<br />
    was weeping, and <br />
    spoke,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cobbled their boots;<br />
    how sorry <br />
    I am.</p>
<p>What moves all things<br />
    is God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translation by: <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/contemp/lad">Daniel Ladinsky</a></p>
<p>From Poetry of  St John of the Cross</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poem is from <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/contemp/love">&ldquo;Love Poems From God</a>&rdquo; and are translated  by Daniel Ladinsky, well known for his poetic versions of Hafiz.</p>
<p>St John of the Cross is widely regarded as one of the great  mystical poets who lived in Spain during the 16th Century. As a  young Carmelite friar John met St Teresa of Avila and became profoundly moved  by her radiant spirituality. In 1577 St John was kidnapped and&nbsp; imprisoned for his support of the reforms to  the Carmelite movement. For several months he suffered appalling conditions and  regular beatings, amounting to torture. However throughout this experience he  came even closer to the divine and amidst the beatings and squalor experienced  visions and ecstasy&rsquo;s. This poem is based on one such vision during his imprisonment.</p>
<p>This poem is from <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/contemp/love">&ldquo;Love Poems From God</a>&rdquo; and are translated  by Daniel Ladinsky, well known for his poetic versions of Hafiz.</p>

<p>Alone we are born<br />
    And die alone<br />
    Yet see the red-gold cirrus<br />
    over snow-mountain shine.</p>
<p>Upon the upland road<br />
    Ride easy, stranger<br />
    Surrender to the sky<br />
    Your heart of anger.</p>
