<div class="plain">Southern Christian Leadership Conference<br />
Atlanta, Georgia<br />
16 August 1967</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br />
</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Now, in order to answer the question, &#8220;Where do we go from here?&#8221; which is our theme, we must first honestly recognize where we are now. When the Constitution was written, a strange formula to determine taxes and representation declared that the Negro was 60 percent of a person. Today another curious formula seems to declare he is 50 percent of a person. Of the good things in life, the Negro has approximately one half those of whites. Of the bad things of life, he has twice those of whites. Thus half of all Negroes live in substandard housing. And Negroes have half the income of whites. When we view the negative experiences of life, the Negro has a double share. There are twice as many unemployed. The rate of infant mortality among Negroes is double that of whites and there are twice as many Negroes dying in Vietnam as whites in proportion to their size in the population. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">In other spheres, the figures are equally alarming. In elementary schools, Negroes lag one to three years behind whites, and their segregated schools receive substantially less money per student than the white schools. One twentieth as many Negroes as whites attend college. Of employed Negroes, 75 percent hold menial jobs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">This is where we are. Where do we go from here? First, we must massively assert our dignity and worth. We must stand up amidst a system that still oppresses us and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of values. We must no longer be ashamed of being black. The job of arousing manhood within a people that have been taught for so many centuries that they are nobody is not easy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="H2" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: lines-together;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA"><span>Depiction of Blackness and Negro Contributions</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: lines-together;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Even semantics have conspired to make that which is black seem ugly and degrading. In Roget&#8217;s Thesaurus there are 120 synonyms for blackness and at least 60 of them are offensive, as for example, blot, soot, grim, devil and foul. And there are some 134 synonyms for whiteness and all are favorable, expressed in such words as purity, cleanliness, chastity and innocence. A white lie is better than a black lie. The most degenerate member of a family is a &#8220;black sheep.&#8221; Ossie Davis has suggested that maybe the English language should be reconstructed so that teachers will not be forced to teach the Negro child 60 ways to despise himself, and thereby perpetuate his false sense of inferiority, and the white child 134 ways to adore himself, and thereby perpetuate his false sense of superiority. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">The tendency to ignore the Negro&#8217;s contribution to American life and to strip him of his personhood, is as old as the earliest history hooks and as contemporary as the morning&#8217;s newspaper. To upset this cultural homicide, the Negro must rise up with an affirmation of his own Olympian manhood. Any movement for the Negro&#8217;s freedom that overlooks this necessity is only waiting to be buried. As long as the mind is enslaved, the body can never be free. Psychological freedom, a firm sense of self-esteem, is the most powerful weapon against the long night of physical slavery. No Lincolnian Emancipation Proclamation or Johnsonian Civil Rights Bill can totally bring this kind of freedom. The Negro will only be free when he reaches down to the inner depths of his own being and signs with the pen and ink of assertive manhood his own Emancipation Proclamation. And, with a spirit straining toward true self-esteem, the Negro must boldly throw off the manacles of self-abnegation and say to himself and to the world, &#8220;I am somebody. I am a person. I am a man with dignity and honor. I have a rich and noble history. How painful and exploited that history has been. Yes, I was a slave through my foreparents and I am not ashamed of that. I&#8217;m ashamed of the people who were so sinful to make me a slave.&#8221; Yes, we must stand up and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m black and I&#8217;m beautiful,&#8221; and this self-affirmation is the black man&#8217;s need, made compelling by the white man&#8217;s crimes against him. </span></p>

<p class="H2" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: lines-together;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA"><span><strong>Basic Challenges</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: lines-together;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Another basic challenge is to discover how to organize our strength in terms of economic and political power. No one can deny that the Negro is in dire need of this kind of legitimate power. Indeed, one of the great problems that the Negro confronts is his lack of power. From old plantations of the South to newer ghettos of the North, the Negro has been confined to a life of voicelessness and powerlessness. Stripped of the right to make decisions concerning his life and destiny he has been subject to the authoritarian and sometimes whimsical decisions of this white power structure. The plantation and ghetto were created by those who had power. both to confine those who had no power and to perpetuate their powerlessness. The problem of transforming the ghetto, therefore, is a problem of power-confrontation of the forces of power demanding change and the forces of power dedicated to the preserving of the status quo. Now power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose. It is the strength required to bring about social, political and economic change. Walter Reuther defined power one day. He said, &#8220;Power is the ability of a labor union like the U.A.W. to make the most powerful corporation in the world, General Motors, say &#8216;Yes&#8217; when it wants to say &#8216;No.&#8217; That&#8217;s power.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Now a lot of us are preachers, and all of us have our moral convictions and concerns, and so often have problems with power. There is nothing wrong with power if power is used correctly. You see, what happened is that some of our philosophers got off base. And one of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites &#8211; polar oppositesÑÑso that love is identified with a resignation of power, and power with a denial of love. </span></p>

It was this same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject the Nietzschean philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love. Now, we&#8217;ve got to get this thing right. What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love. And this is what we must see as we move on. What has happened is that we have had it wrong and confused in our own country, and this has led Negro Americans in the past to seek their goals through power devoid of love and conscience. </span></p>

Now, early in this century this proposal would have been greeted with ridicule and denunciation, as destructive of initiative and responsibility. At that time economic status was considered the measure of the individual&#8217;s ability and talents. And, in the thinking of that day, the absence of worldly goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber. We&#8217;ve come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operations of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against their will. Today the poor are less often dismissed, I hope, from our consciences by being branded as inferior or incompetent. We also know that no matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all poverty. </span></p>

We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available. In I879 Henry George anticipated this state of affairs when he wrote in Progress and Poverty: </span></p>

It is not the work of slaves driven to their tasks either by the task, by the taskmaster, or by anirnal (sic) necessity. It is the work of men who somehow find a form of work that brings a security for its own sake and a state of society where want is abolished. </span></p>

The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in their struggle. </span></p>

The dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands, when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands, wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on the scale of dollars is eliminated . </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: lines-together;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Now, let me say briefly that we must reaffirm our commitment to nonviolence. I want to stress this. The futility of violence in the struggle for racial justice has been tragically etched in all the recent Negro riots. Yesterday, I tried to analyze the riots and deal with their causes. Today I want to give the other side. There is certainly something painfully sad about a riot. One sees screaming youngsters and angry adults fighting hopelessly and aimlessly against impossible odds. And deep down within them, you can even see a desire for self-destruction, a kind of suicidal longing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">Occasionally Negroes contend that the 1965 Watts riot and the other riots in various cities represented effective civil rights action. But those who express this view always end up with stumbling words when asked what concrete gains have been won as a result. At best, the riots have produced a little additional antipoverty money allotted by frightened government officials, and a few water-sprinklers to cool the children of the ghettos. It is something like improving the food in the prison while the people remain securely incarcerated behind bars. Nowhere have the riots won any concrete improvement such as have the organized protest demonstrations. When one tries to pin down advocates of violence as to what acts would be effective, the answers are blatantly illogical. Sometimes they talk of overthrowing racist state and local governments and they talk about guerrilla warfare. They fail to see that no internal revolution has ever succeeded in overthrowing a government by violence unless the government had already lost the allegiance and effective control of its armed forces. Anyone in his right mind knows that this will not happen in the United States. In a violent racial situation, the power structure has the local police, the state troopers, the National Guard and, finally, the Army to call onÑÑall of which are predominantly white. Furthermore, few if any violent revolutions have been successful unless the violent minority had the sympathy and support of the nonresistant majority. Castro may have had only a few Cubans actually fighting with him up in the hills, but he could never have overthrown the Batista regime unless he had the sympathy of the vast majority of Cuban people. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 5.0pt; margin-left: 0in; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA;" lang="FR-CA" xml:lang="FR-CA">It is perfectly clear that a violent revolution on the part of American blacks would find no sympathy and support from the white population and very little from the majority of the Negroes themselves. This is no time for romantic illusions and empty philosophical debates about freedom. This is a time for action. What is needed is a strategy for change, a tactical program that will bring the Negro into the mainstream of American life as quickly as possible. So far, this has only been offered by the nonviolent movement. Without recognizing this we will end up with solutions that don&#8217;t solve, answers that don&#8217;t answer and explanations that don&#8217;t explain. </span></p>

And I am still convinced that it is the most potent weapon available to the Negro in his struggle for justice in this country. And the other thing is that I am concerned about a better world. I&#8217;m concerned about justice. I&#8217;m concerned about brotherhood. I&#8217;m concerned about truth. And when one is concerned about these, he can never advocate violence. For through violence you may murder a murderer but you can&#8217;t murder. Through violence you may murder a liar but you can&#8217;t establish truth. Through violence you may murder a hater, but you can&#8217;t murder hate. Darkness cannot put out darkness. Only light can do that. </span></p>

For I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind&#8217;s problems. And I&#8217;m going to talk about it everywhere I go. I know it isn&#8217;t popular to talk about it in some circles today. I&#8217;m not talking about emotional bosh when I talk about love, I&#8217;m talking about a strong, demanding love. And I have seen too much hate. I&#8217;ve seen too much hate on the faces of sheriffs in the South. I&#8217;ve seen hate on the faces of too many Klansmen and too many White Citizens Councilors in the South to want to hate myself, because every time I see it, I know that it does something to their faces and their personalities and I say to myself that hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to love. If you are seeking the highest good, I think you can find it through love. And the beautiful thing is that we are moving against wrong when we do it, because John was right, God is love. He who hates does not know God, but he who has love has the key that unlocks the door to the meaning of ultimate reality. </span></p>

There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask the question, &#8220;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&#8221; And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I&#8217;m simply saying that more and more, we&#8217;ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life&#8217;s market place. But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends, when you deal with this, you begin to ask the question, &#8220;Who owns the oil?&#8221; You begin to ask the question, &#8220;Who owns the iron ore?&#8221; You begin to ask the question, &#8220;Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&#8221; These are questions that must be asked. </span></p>

Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both. Now, when I say question the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated. </span></p>

Jesus didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Now Nicodemus, you must stop lying.&#8221; HE didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Nicodemus, you must stop cheating if you are doing that.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Nicodemus, you must not commit adultery.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Nicodemus, now you must stop drinking liquor if you are doing that excessively.&#8221; He said something altogether different, because Jesus realized something basic &#8211; that if a man will lie, he will steal. And if a man will steal, he will kill. So instead of just getting bogged down in one thing, Jesus looked at him and said, &#8220;Nicodemus, you must be born again.&#8221;</span></p>

Therefore they will exploit them, and poor people generally, economically. And a nation that will exploit economically will have to have foreign investments and everything else, and will have to use its military might to protect them. All of these problems are tied together. What I am saying today is that we must go from this convention and say, &#8220;America, you must be born again!&#8221; </span></p>

Let us be dissatisfied until the tragic walls that separate the outer city of wealth and comfort and the inner city of poverty and despair shall be crushed by the battering rams of the forces of justice. [,et us be dissatisfied until those that live on the outskirts of hope are brought into the metropolis of daily security. Let us be dissatisfied until slums are cast into the junk heaps of history, and every family is living in a decent sanitary home. Let us be dissatisfied until the dark yesterdays of segregated schools will be transformed into bright tomorrows of quality, integrated education. Let us be dissatisfied until integration is not seen as a problem but as an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity. Let us be dissatisfied until men and women, however black they may be, will be judged on the basis of the content of their character and not on the basis of the color of their skin. Let us be dissatisfied. Let us be dissatisfied until every state capitol houses a governor who will do justly, who will love mercy and who will walk humbly with his God. Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, justice will roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. Let us be dissatisfied until that day when the lion and the lamb shall lie down together. and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree and none shall be afraid. Let us be dissatisfied. And men will recognize that out of one blood God made all men to dwell upon the face of the earth. Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout &#8220;White Power!&#8221; &#8211; when nobody will shout &#8220;Black Power!&#8221; &#8211; but everybody will talk about God&#8217;s power and human power. </span></p>

There will still be rocky places of frustration and meandering points of bewilderment. There will be inevitable setbacks here and there. There will be those moments when the buoyancy of hope will be transformed into the fatigue of despair. Our dreams will sometimes be shattered and our ethereal hopes blasted. We may again with tear-drenched eyes have to stand before the bier of some courageous civil-rights worker whose life will be snuffed out by the dastardly acts of bloodthirsty mobs. Difficult and painful as it is, we must walk on in the days ahead with an audacious faith in the future. And as we continue our charted course, we may gain consolation in the words so nobly left by that great black bard who was also a great freedom fighter of yesterday, James Weldon Johnson: </span></p>
