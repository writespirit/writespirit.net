<div class="plain">
<p>We are all seekers-seekers of Truth. For us there can                             be nothing more valuable or significant than realisation.</p>
<p> There are three kinds of realisation: I can, I have                             and I am. I can see the face of Truth, the transcendental                             Truth. I have deep within me Eternity, Infinity and                             Immortality. I am God. These are the main realisations                             that each individual will eventually achieve.</p>
<p> In order to achieve realisation, aspiration is of                             supreme importance. Eternity&#8217;s two immortal friends                             are aspiration and realisation. The goal of aspiration                             is to ascend. The goal of realisation is to transcend.</p>
<p> Inspiration is also of paramount importance. Our inspiration                             carries us from the foot of the life tree to the topmost                             branch of the life tree. Our aspiration takes us from                             the world of suffering to the world of light and delight.                             Our realisation transforms our Eternity&#8217;s cry into our                             Infinity&#8217;s smile. Our Eternity&#8217;s cry is what we now                             have. Our Infinity&#8217;s smile is what we shall one day                             become.</p>
<p> Each individual seeker has an inner cry, which we                             call aspiration. Again, each individual seeker has an                             inner message: dedication. Our dedication makes us feel                             that God the Creator and God the creation are inseparably                             one. Therefore, while serving God the creation, we are                             becoming one with God the Creator.</p>
<p> Aspiration teaches us the necessity of realisation,                             and realisation teaches us the ne-cessity of self-transcendence.                             Why? Because our Source, our Beloved Supreme Himself,                             at every moment is transcending His own Vision Reality                             and His own Reality Vision.</p>
<p> Dedication is part and parcel of God-manifestation.                             Since God is ever transcending, there is no end to our                             God manifestation. Therefore, manifestation also makes                             us feel the necessity of self-transcendence. Our self-transcendence                             takes place in and through our God manifestation here                             on earth. Each time we transcend ourselves we see that                             God is being manifested in and through us in a most                             special and significant way.</p>
<p> Our dedication and realisation tell us that we always                             have to go beyond, beyond, beyond. Today&#8217;s goal is only                             the starting point for tomorrow&#8217;s journey. Today&#8217;s perfection                             marks the very beginning of tomorrow&#8217;s new creation.                             Today&#8217;s satisfaction is the harbinger of an even greater                             hunger for more purity, more beauty and more closeness                             and oneness with God.</p>
<p> Realisation is beauty&#8217;s flower and duty&#8217;s fruit. Beauty&#8217;s                             flower is our heart, and duty&#8217;s fruit is our life. Beauty                             is our self-giving; duty is our God becoming. Beauty                             reveals the Infinite in the finite; duty manifests the                             Immortal in the mortal. Beauty tells the God seeker                             that his source is in God. Duty tells the God seeker                             that his life is for God and God alone.</p>
<p> Indian philosophy, Indian religion and Indian spirituality                             from time immemorial have had only one message-the message                             of realisation, or &#8220;Know thyself.&#8221; When a                             seeker knows himself, he declares, &#8220;Aham Brahmasmi&#8221;-&#8221;I                             am Brahman, the One without a second.&#8221; This same                             message was offered here in the West when the Saviour                             declared, &#8220;I and my Father are one.&#8221; This                             is the loftiest realisation of the soul.</p>
<p> In order to experience God realisation, each individual                             has to develop some inner discipline. Again, inside                             this inner discipline, the easiest way to approach the                             highest Reality is through love, devotion and surrender.</p>
<p> I am speaking here of divine love, which is altogether                             different from human love. Human love tries to possess                             and be possessed. Therefore, human love always fails                             to satisfy us. But divine love at each moment wants                             to expand, and while expanding, it liberates.</p>
<p> Human devotion is nothing short of attachment. In                             human devotion, the devotee and the object of his devotion                             are like two blind beggars with no goal or destination.                             But divine devotion only intensifies our inner cry for                             higher light and delight. Divine devotion intensifies                             our heart&#8217;s purity at every moment, and this is of paramount                             importance in realising the absolute Reality. Last comes                             surrender. In human life we surrender to our superiors.                             Like slaves we surrender to those who have power over                             us. But this kind of surrender is a far cry from spiritual                             surrender. When a human being surrenders to a superior,                             there is no guarantee that this so called superior possesses                             more light.</p>
<p> In divine surrender we surrender to our Source, so                             that we can consciously become part and parcel of that                             Source. In the spiritual life we surrender cheerfully,                             soulfully and unconditionally to our higher Self in                             order to become one with our Highest. The tiny drop                             knows that its reality is the ocean. When it consciously                             merges with the ocean, it loses its individual identity                             and becomes the ocean itself.</p>
<p> We want to achieve quite a few things in life. In                             order to accomplish our outer goals, we try to influence                             others by every possible means. Sometimes we adopt foul                             means or try to deceive others; others also try to deceive                             us. But if our goal is God realisation, we cannot hope                             to deceive God or influence God through foul means.                             In fact, this is not at all necessary. God&#8217;s dearest                             wish is for us to realise Him.</p>
<p> God says to us, &#8220;My child, I have countless ways                             for you to realise Me. If one particular way does not                             suit your nature, then there are many, many other ways.                             I shall present Myself before you in countless ways                             in order that you may realise Me. At every moment I                             shall knock at your heart&#8217;s door, and if you sincerely                             want to receive Me, you will open the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Now I wish to be of dedicated service to you all in                             a practical way by answering a few spiritual questions.                           </p>
<p><b>Professor David Eckel:</b> Sri Chinmoy has asked                             for spiritual questions. If there are any issues that                             you would like to raise with him that come out of your                             study of Hindu myth and ritual, or out of your study                             of Hindu philosophy, this would be a good time to ask                             them.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Where do ignorance and suffering come                             from? To put it another way, where does the first impulse                             of karma come from, especially if God is all things,                             and God is ostensibly free from karma and ignorance?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> There is something in us that likes                             ignorance and enjoys wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance.                             We can call it the vital, or the physical consciousness,                             or the mental consciousness, or something else. But                             definitely there is something inside us that consciously                             or unconsciously supports ignorance. The camel&#8217;s mouth                             bleeds when it eats thorns, but it continues to eat                             thorns. Similarly, we know how much suffering ignorance                             causes in our human life, but part of us does not want                             to go beyond ignorance.</p>
<p> Again, there is something inside us that does want                             to go beyond ignorance and suffering, and that is our                             soul. So at every moment, consciously or unconsciously                             we are supporting ignorance and, at the same time, we                             are consciously trying to go beyond it. But once we                             are awakened, we feel only the necessity of going beyond                             it and of remaining beyond it.</p>
<p> Ignorance is primarily a limitation of the human mind;                             this is where the problem starts. The mind has a very                             limited capacity. It has fixed and rigid rules. It says                             that if God is this, then He cannot be that. But why                             can God not be this and also that? If God is omniscient                             and omnipotent, if God is omnipresent, then He is everything.                             The mind is always dividing, and while dividing it is                             binding and limiting itself. Since human beings mostly                             live in the mind, we are constantly trying to bind and                             limit Reality. But the divine Reality is not something                             that can be bound. It can only be enlarged and expanded.                             Unlike the mind, the heart is all oneness, so it has                             the capacity to become one with the Reality, like a                             drop that enters into the ocean and becomes the ocean                             itself. If we can consciously remain all the time in                             the heart, then we will be able to establish our oneness                             with the divine Reality, which is the soul&#8217;s Reality.                             In that realm there is no ignorance; there is only light                             and delight.</p>
<p> When we approach Reality with our heart and identify                             with that highest Reality, we see that what we call                             suffering, in a deeper sense is not suffering at all.                             When we enter into the Buddha consciousness, Krishna                             conscious-ness or Christ consciousness, at that time                             we see suffering as an experience that is growing and                             glowing inside us for the transformation of our human                             nature and the manifestation of a higher light from                             Above. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You said oneness is living in the heart,                             not in the mind. But in order to become aware of the                             heart, don&#8217;t you first have to know what it is you&#8217;re                             trying to reach and have some concept of where you&#8217;re                             going?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> Let us speak in terms of what we                             want from life instead of what we are aiming at or trying                             to reach. If what we really want is happiness, if what                             we really want is peace and bliss, then we will cry                             for these things. The reason we have to go to the heart                             is because the heart hungers for these things, and also                             the heart knows how to cry. Unless I feel and express                             my hunger, who is going to feed me? The mind does not                             have that kind of hunger. And even if the mind manages                             to create a hunger in itself, the moment someone brings                             food, the mind will doubt and suspect it. The mind will                             say, &#8220;Is it food or is it poison?&#8221;</p>
<p> In the outer life, if a child cries, immediately the                             mother will come running to give him what he needs.                             The child may be in another room, but she will come                             running to give him food, or a toy, or whatever it is                             he is crying for. Similarly, if we sincerely cry inside                             our heart for the highest Reality, then no matter where                             we are, God will come running to give it to us.</p>
<p> The mind is always doubtful and suspicious. This moment                             my mind makes me feel that you are a good man, and the                             next moment my mind will say you are a very bad man.                             And then the mind will say, &#8220;Who am I to judge                             him? Let him remain whatever he is. Whether he is a                             good man or a bad man, it is his life after all.&#8221;                             So where is satisfaction in this approach? But if my                             heart feels that you are a good man, then immediately                             it will try to know more about you. On the strength                             of its oneness, the heart is always trying to proceed                             forward, farther and deeper. But the mind just questions                             its own discoveries over and over again. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You spoke of three types of realisation-I                             can, I have and I am. My question is about the second                             one-I have. What can one have in the final analysis?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> In the final analysis, one has                             what one becomes. We have deep within us the things                             that we have always been longing for: Eternity, Infinity                             and Immortality, infinite peace, light and bliss. But                             right now we are not aware that we have these. Right                             now we are looking here, there and everywhere for these                             things, without knowing where to search for them.</p>
<p> But if we pray and meditate sincerely, there will                             come a time when we will realise the Truth. At that                             time we will see that the things we have been searching                             and crying for are things we have deep within us. We                             embody these very things.</p>
<p> When we embark on our journey, the first thing we                             have to know is that we can: we can reach the ultimate                             Truth. Then we have to realise that this ultimate Truth                             is not somewhere else or someone else&#8217;s. It is deep                             within us; it has always been ours. Our third and ultimate                             discovery is that we represent the Truth; we are the                             Truth.</p>
<p> So, to come back to your question, the second realisation-I                             have-in the final analysis is transformed into the third                             realisation-I am. What we have is what we have always                             had, and when we consciously realise this, we grow into                             it. Then we see that what we have consciously become                             is what we have always been and eternally are. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> How do we explain the suffering that                             people undergo through no fault of their own-like the                             Holocaust, for example?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> We human beings do not know the                             present, past or future. We have no idea of what an                             individual or a collective group did in previous incarnations.                             We do not know the karma they have accrued. The law                             of karma says that each person reaps what he sows, but                             we do not know when the particular seed was sowed. So                             when it is time to reap the fruit, sometimes people                             have very unfortunate experiences in life which they                             cannot explain or understand.</p>
<p> Apart from that, ignorance forces are all around;                             ignorance itself, let us say, is a force. You may be                             a saint, but these forces are all around, and you may                             not have mastery over them. So although you may have                             done nothing wrong, these forces may still attack you.                             Many innocent people are affected by these forces. So                             if someone is suffering, we can usually attribute it                             to the karma he got from some previous incarnation,                             but it is also possible that his suffering is caused                             by undivine forces.</p>
<p> Each of us has a soul, a heart, a mind, a vital and                             a physical consciousness. Our soul is entirely divine;                             it is God&#8217;s representative within us. Our heart at times                             wants to identify itself with others and feel its oneness                             with the world, but at times it also suffers from insecurity.                             Our mind, on the one hand, wants to know the truth and                             to have peace in itself and in the world; but, on the                             other hand, it immediately becomes suspicious when it                             sees peace, and it constantly tries to separate and                             divide things. Our vital can be dynamic, but it can                             also be aggressive. Our body allows itself to be guided                             by the stronger tendencies of the other parts of our                             being; but its own tendency is just to be inert.</p>
<p> So each part of our being has a good part and a discouraging                             part. This moment one part of our being will act divinely                             and the next moment it will act undivinely. The divine                             in us is trying all the time to make us perfect and                             thus to make the world perfect. It is constantly praying                             for God realisation, God revelation and God manifestation.                             But we also have another reality inside us, which only                             wants to lord it over others and destroy others.</p>
<p> The divine in us feels miserable if some catastrophe                             takes place in the world. But the human in us or the                             animal in us may get malicious pleasure, because the                             catastrophe is happening in some other part of the world,                             and we are unaffected. Not only do these undivine forces                             inside us get pleasure when bad things happen, but they                             can actually cause bad things to happen. The undivine                             forces that we have or that we embody can create countless                             problems in the world. </p>
<p><b>Professor Diana Eck:</b> When you speak of the Beloved                             Supreme Himself, how do you imagine the Supreme to be?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> It is not a matter of imagination;                             it is a matter of experience. You can experience the                             Beloved Supreme in one particular way. I may experience                             Him in a different way. Each one, on the strength of                             his or her aspiration, experience and realisation, will                             see the Supreme in a different but most convincing way.</p>
<p> If I am looking for a policeman and I find someone                             in a policeman&#8217;s uniform, I will be very pleased. Because                             he is wearing his uniform, I will know that he is a                             policeman. But if you are looking for a policeman, and                             you happen to know that so and so is a policeman, then                             you will be in a position to approach him even if he                             isn&#8217;t wearing his uniform. Similarly, if one is already                             in tune with the higher realities, he will have the                             experience of the Beloved Supreme in one form, whereas                             someone who is having the experience of the Highest                             for the first time may have it in a different way.</p>
<p> It is like the child whose father is a Supreme Court                             judge. When the child sees his father in ordinary street                             clothes, he still knows that his father is a Supreme                             Court judge. And when he goes to the courtroom and sees                             his father in a judge&#8217;s robe, he still knows that this                             individual is his father. But if somebody who is not                             a member of the family sees the judge on the street,                             he will not recognise him. Similarly, each individual                             sees the Beloved Supreme in a specific way that will                             be totally convincing to him. </p>
<p><b>Professor Diana Eck:</b> When we think then of the                             ways in which people from different parts of our human                             family have experienced the Beloved Supreme-as Krishna,                             or Christ, or the rather horrific form of Kali-can we                             feel that all these are equal?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> They are all equal. But we are                             making a mistake when we see one aspect of the divine                             Reality as horrifying or terrifying. It is not like                             that. In Hinduism we often speak of creation, preservation                             and destruction. But &#8216;destruction&#8217; is the wrong term;                             a better term is &#8216;transformation&#8217;. When we see Kali&#8217;s                             powerful aspect, we feel that she is torturing us and                             destroying us. But she is actually transforming us.                             When the doctor gives us an injection, or when he operates                             on us, it is very painful; we consider it sheer torture.                             But he is doing it only to cure some disease or ailment                             that we have.</p>
<p> If a child is unruly, at some point the father may                             threaten the child or even strike him. That doesn&#8217;t                             mean that the father at that time has less affection                             or less compassion for the child. No, the father is                             only doing the needful. The child needs to learn, but                             he does not know where or how to find the truth. So                             the father may come in a powerful or frightening aspect                             to teach him. At another time, when the child is doing                             something good, the father will show his affectionate                             side, and that will also help the child to learn.</p>
<p> So the Supreme will come in different aspects, depending                             on what each individual needs and wants. If the Divine                             comes in the Kali aspect, it is not to punish someone                             but to perfect that individual. Our ordinary human consciousness                             may take it as punishment, but from the highest point                             of view it is for our transformation and perfection.                           </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Sri Chinmoy, you&#8217;ve been teaching us                             about self-realisation and realisation of the Supreme.                             In the spiritual life, what should be one&#8217;s responsibility                             to others?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> It depends on the individual&#8217;s                             inner growth. If you are an absolute beginner, I will                             tell you to go very slowly. If you are advanced, then                             I will tell you to go very fast. But at every step you                             have to dive deep within to see if you are doing the                             right thing. Then you will get the inner message whether                             it is God&#8217;s Will for you to mix with so and so. It may                             or may not be God&#8217;s Will that you mix with certain people                             at this stage of your spiritual development.</p>
<p> Just because God wants someone to spend his time praying                             and meditating rather than entering into human interactions,                             that individual should not think that he is spiritually                             superior to others. No, it is simply that God does not                             want him to be involved in the social life at this particular                             stage of his development. Again, someone else cannot                             say that just because he is deeply involved in philanthropy                             or social work that he is superior. In the spiritual                             life, the first and foremost thing is to hear the message                             from within and to obey that message. Only then are                             you doing the right thing.</p>
<p> So there is no hard and fast rule as to whether it                             is desirable or undesirable for spiritual people to                             mix with the rest of the world. You may say, &#8220;If                             I don&#8217;t serve the world, then how am I going to realise                             God?&#8221; This type of question can be answered only                             from within. What I have to do for my inner progress                             may be different from what you have to do. If it is                             difficult for the seeker to get this message from within,                             then he has to go to a teacher who can identify himself                             with the soul&#8217;s needs and then tell the individual what                             they are. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Once a seeker attains realisation,                             does he always have that realisation within him, or                             does the seeker have to experience the human aspect                             again?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> Let us take realisation as a tree.                             If somebody can sit at the foot of the realisation tree,                             then we can&#8217;t deny that he is a realised soul-especially                             if we ourselves are hundreds of miles away from the                             tree. Again, there may be somebody else who has climbed                             up the tree a little or even reached the highest branch,                             but he cannot come down. Again, there will be a third                             person who will be able to go up and come down at his                             sweet will. He will go up and eat the mangoes, and then                             bring some down to give to his brothers and sisters.                             When he goes up he takes the cry of earth, and when                             he comes down he brings the smile of Heaven.</p>
<p> So we have to know how much capacity an individual                             has. Some can sit at the foot of the tree. Some can                             climb up but do not dare to come down because they are                             afraid they will be engulfed by earthly ignorance. Again,                             there are a few great Masters, like Krishna, Buddha,                             Christ, Sri Ramakrishna and others, who can freely go                             up and come down again. When they come down from the                             realisation tree and enter into the earth consciousness                             again, they don&#8217;t lose anything. At any time they can                             climb up and drink Nectar Delight, and then they can                             come down and offer Nectar Delight to humanity. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Some thinkers have allowed the possibility                             of complete enlightenment and release while here on                             earth, while others say that the final release from                             karmic bondage comes only with death. What is your feeling                             on this?</p>
<p><b>Sri Chinmoy:</b> From the highest spiritual point                             of view, we have to attain illumination here on earth;                             we cannot attain illumination in the higher worlds.                             If I do bad things all throughout my life and think                             of God or pray to God only at the last moment, I cannot                             expect to achieve illumination in the other world. When                             it is time for me to leave the body, I will not be able                             to enter into a very high state of consciousness. While                             I am alive I have to achieve illumination, liberation                             or realisation through prayer, meditation and right                             action. If someone does not attain something while in                             the physical body, he will not be able to get it after                             he leaves the body.</p>
<p> The Buddha, the Christ and all the spiritual Masters                             realised God here on earth. It is in the physical that                             we have to achieve and embody the highest states of                             consciousness. The body is like a temple. Inside some                             temples, unfortunately, there is no shrine, no living                             God-consciousness. But inside the body temple of those                             who have attained liberation and realisation are the                             most beautiful shrines. It is absurd to think that someone                             will attain the highest realisation or get illumination                             after he has left the body if he has not achieved it                             during his life on earth. God has to be seen, felt and                             realised here on earth. </p>
