<p class="documentDescription">The Seeker&#8217;s Four Lives</p>
<div class="plain">             Dear seekers of the infinite Light and Truth, dear                             sisters and brothers of the Spirit Universal, here in                             Zurich I see and feel indomitable strength: strength                             of the body, strength of the vital, strength of the                             mind and strength of the heart. In the spiritual life                             nothing is as important as strength and courage. But                             this strength is not the strength of a hostile force                             to be utilised for an undivine purpose. Your strength,                             spiritual strength, is being utilised for a new dawn                             and a new era. You are inundated with the strength of                             the spirit, the strength that we call inner strength.
<p> Four thousand years ago the Indian seers of the hoary                             past, the vedic seers and sages taught us this sublime                             truth: Nayam atma bala hinena labhyo. &#8220;The soul                             cannot be won by the weakling.&#8221; Only the strong                             can face the teeming ignorance night and transform it                             into wisdom day. He who lacks strength will never dare                             to enter into the spiritual life.</p>
<p> When we enter into the spiritual life we become fully                             conscious of our four simultaneous lives. It is only                             in the spiritual life that we become aware of our animal                             life, human life, divine life and immortal Life. Before                             we enter into the spiritual life, these lives are practically                             unknown to us, simply because we are not conscious of                             their existence.</p>
<p> What do we mean by the animal life? The animal life                             is the life of jealousy, doubt and destruction or conscious                             annihilation. The animal life is like a strong and binding                             rope. Although the propensity of the animal life is                             to fight and destroy, there is something in the process                             of evolution that tries to curb this destructive tendency.                             That is why from the animal life we enter into a higher                             form, the human life.</p>
<p> In the human life we still notice a half-animal life.                             That is to say, we still quarrel, fight, destroy and                             do many other undivine things. But in the human life                             we also notice something very meaningful and fruitful,                             which is called hope. We cherish and treasure an illumining                             hope. Hope is not something vague and tempting yet millions                             of miles away from the actual blossoming of reality.                             No, hope is something that is pushing us forward, pulling                             us upward to a sublime Reality. Hope is constantly helping                             us and energising us to run toward the destined Goal.</p>
<p> At times we see that our hopes are smashed into millions                             of fragments. Why does this happen? It happens precisely                             because we do not feed our hope with aspiration, with                             our inner cry. We hope for something, but when difficulties                             arise we just calmly and peaceably give up our hope.                             Instead of hope&#8217;s deserting us, very often we desert                             hope. We do not give hope a full chance to continue                             its journey.</p>
<p> In the spiritual life we become aware not only of                             the animal and the human life, but of the divine life                             as well. In the divine life we get constant opportunities.                             We are told that opportunity does not often knock at                             our door, but when we try to live the divine life, we                             come to realise that opportunity knocks at our door                             at every second. We are told that God&#8217;s choice Hour                             dawns once in a blue moon, but this is not true. When                             we enter into the spiritual life we see that God&#8217;s Hour                             strikes at every moment. We have only to avail ourselves                             of each glowing opportunity and of each golden moment.</p>
<p> When we follow the spiritual life we have to make                             friends with joy. God is constantly offering us this                             joy, but we are rejecting it ruthlessly at every moment.                             We prefer to wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. Now,                             there is an easy and effective way in which we can inundate                             our being with real joy. It is through our constant                             inner cry. Outwardly we cry for name and fame, outer                             achievements and material possessions. But when we cry                             inwardly, when we cry from deep within, from the inmost                             recesses of our heart, what we are crying for is Light,                             Delight, divine Illumination, divine Perfection. The                             inner life tells us that Delight in infinite measure                             is at our disposal, that it is our birthright. But because                             we do not consciously try to claim it as our very own,                             Delight is still a far cry.</p>
<p> Now what is the difference between pleasure and Joy                             or Delight? Pleasure is something that is bound to be                             followed by frustration, and inside frustration what                             looms large is destruction. We can confidently say that                             today&#8217;s pleasure will be tomorrow&#8217;s frustration and                             the destruction of the day after tomorrow. But when                             we follow the spiritual life we see deep within us the                             fountain of Joy and Delight. This Delight continuously                             increases in our awakened being. The seeker in us knows                             perfectly well that our origin was Delight. Anandadd                             hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante . . . &#8220;From                             Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow or                             expand our consciousness. At the end of our journey&#8217;s                             close, into Delight we retire.&#8221; Delight is our                             origin, and our goal is to go back consciously to the                             Source, which is all Delight.</p>
<p> What is Delight or Bliss? It is inner freedom, nothing                             else. This inner freedom, when properly used, brings                             to the fore the outer freedom. If the inner freedom                             does not energise or instruct or illumine the outer                             freedom, the outer freedom will often act like a mad                             elephant. In today&#8217;s world we see how freedom is misused                             by millions and millions of people. But when the inner                             freedom comes to the fore and inspires the outer freedom,                             the outer freedom will reach the destined goal safely                             and, at the same time, most convincingly and most satisfactorily.</p>
<p> The immortal Life is the life that contains the divine                             life in its fullest measure. At the same time, it has                             destroyed the binding rope of the animal life and energised                             the human life to enter into the divine life. When we                             enter into the immortal Life, the animal in us is either                             destroyed or totally transformed, as night is transformed                             into day. Our human weakness is transformed into strength.                             Our imperfection is transformed into perfection. All                             human frailties are illumined and transformed into an                             ever growing, ever fulfilling Light and Delight.</p>
<p> How can we make steady progress, convincing progress,                             in our spiritual life? We can make satisfactory, conscious                             and fulfilling progress only by smiling-smiling at the                             world, smiling at our reality, smiling at Heaven. Each                             time we smile at any particular reality, if it is a                             divine reality, our smile immediately increases our                             capacity, and if it is something undivine, then our                             smile weakens or destroys its undivine possibilities                             and potentialities. Now, this smile is not just an ordinary                             human smile. This smile comes directly from the depths                             of our heart and from the full awakening of our soul.                             It immediately makes us feel that we have pleased and                             fulfilled our Inner Pilot.</p>
<p> We get this inner smile through prayer and meditation.                             When we pray, we feel that sooner or later God will                             come to us and fulfil our prayer. Or very often we go                             to God through our prayer, and then God fulfils us.                             Either we go to God or God comes to us. Here in the                             Western world, we give more importance to prayer than                             to meditation. There is nothing wrong with this. If                             I like my right eye more than my left eye, and if you                             like your left eye more than your right eye, there is                             nothing wrong in it. Prayer and meditation are like                             two eyes. Both eyes are eager to show us the Light and                             offer us the Light.</p>
<p> There are many people in the West who go to churches,                             synagogues and other spiritual places to pray. But their                             prayers have become mechanical. They are a monotonous                             routine. You have to eat your breakfast; you eat it,                             but there is no joy in it. It has become a daily routine.                             But I wish to say that when we pray, we must pray with                             a feeling of intensity, with the idea of working for                             the thing we want to have. If we do this, there is every                             possibility that our prayers will be sanctioned and                             granted. We have to envision the result while praying.                             If we do not envision the reality we are praying for,                             then immediately there will be a yawning gap between                             our prayer and the result we are seeking, between the                             dream and the reality.</p>
<p> But it is only the beginner who will pray in this                             way, always wanting what he calls satisfactory results                             from his prayers. When we grow in the spiritual life,                             in the process of our inner evolution there comes a                             time when we see that what counts most is not the fulfilment                             of our prayer at all. We want good results, but if good                             results come in the form of defeat or failure, so to                             speak, we accept them with equal joy. In fact we get                             enormous joy when we can offer our so called defeat                             at the Feet of God. In the spiritual life, victory and                             defeat are like the obverse and the reverse of the same                             coin. This is the second stage of our development, when                             we can offer the same joy to God whether our prayer                             is fulfilled in our own way or not.</p>
<p> The third and last stage is when we pray to God constantly,                             but do not care for the result whatsoever. We feel that                             our business is only to pray, and the rest is God&#8217;s                             business. We have the inner urge to pray unconditionally,                             and we feel that it is the divine responsibility of                             our Inner Pilot to sanction our prayer or not. If He                             does not sanction it, we do not mind at all. When we                             can pray unconditionally we make the fastest progress.</p>
<p> There is another way to make the fastest progress,                             and that is through conscious and constant surrender                             to the Will of the Supreme. Now, surrender is a very                             complicated word. An idle human being surrenders to                             ignorance, to the world. He does not want to make any                             progress. He has surrendered to his fate, and he will                             not lift a finger. But that kind of surrender is no                             surrender. That is only self deception, and self deception                             is nothing other than self destruction.</p>
<p> Then again, there is the surrender of a slave to his                             master. A slave surrenders to his master out of fear                             or outer compulsion. But in the spiritual life there                             is no outer compulsion, none whatsoever. It is our inner                             being that compels us from deep within to offer our                             surrender to the Supreme Pilot. It makes us feel an                             inner urge to surrender. We feel that we are right now                             just an iota of the infinite Truth. But when this little                             iota of truth merges into the Sea of Truth, it loses                             its individual personality and becomes the Universal                             Reality, the Universal Individuality, the Universal                             Immortality.</p>
<p> In the spiritual life, we have to offer our aspiration,                             our prayer, our concentration, our meditation and our                             contemplation consciously to God. We have to make a                             conscious personal effort and, at the same time, we                             have to offer our inner surrender to God. We must feel                             that we can sincerely say, &#8220;Lord, this much I can                             do with my hands. This much I can do with my eyes. This                             much I can do with my physical capacity. The only thing                             more than that which I have is the capacity to surrender,                             and this I am giving to You.&#8221;</p>
<p> In the spiritual life, conscious and divine surrender                             is the only way to realise the Highest, to grow into                             the Highest, to reveal the Highest and to manifest the                             Highest-the Transcendental Reality. When we consciously                             try to offer all our capacity to God, and to offer Him                             also our divine unconditional surrender, then in return                             He will offer us His infinite Joy, Light, Peace and                             Power. At that time He offers us the message of His                             divine Victory and gives us the capacity to become His                             chosen instruments to establish the Kingdom of Heaven                             here on earth.</p>
