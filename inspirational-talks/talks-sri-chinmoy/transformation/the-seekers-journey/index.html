<div class="plain">
<p>Some of you have come here to see a spiritual teacher.                             Some of you have come to see a yogi. Some of you have                             come to see a seeker. I am grateful to those who have                             come here to see the spiritual teacher in me. I am more                             grateful to those who have come to see the yogi in me.                             I am most grateful to those who have come here to see                             the seeker in me.</p>
<p> As a spiritual teacher, I teach my students or disciples                             with my heart&#8217;s love. I have no other way. I have no                             other knowledge but the knowledge of love. With my heart&#8217;s                             love, I try to teach my followers and disciples.</p>
<p> As a yogi who is constantly one with his Inner Pilot,                             I try to be always at the command of my Inner Pilot.                             I try to execute His commands and thereby be of service                             to those who come to me for inner guidance. </p>
<p> As a seeker, I am always at the feet of the Transcendental                             Supreme. I am a seeker, a seeker of the Infinite Truth.                             A seeker knows that his journey will never come to an                             end. He realises the Truth, but he feels that there                             is no end to his realisation. He discovers the loftiest                             Truth, the Transcendental Truth, but then he feels there                             is no end to his Truth discovery. He comes to realise                             that because God is infinite, eternal and immortal,                             there is no end to God&#8217;s Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.                             God Himself is constantly transcending His own Infinity,                             Eternity and Immortality. So we must realise that we                             are seekers of the ever-transcending Beyond. Each seeker                             is transcending his own capacity, his own reality, his                             own dream, his own realisation every day, every hour,                             every minute and every second.</p>
<p> When one becomes a sincere seeker, he discovers something                             which a non seeker has not discovered. A sincere seeker                             of the highest Truth discovers the fact that he made                             a solemn promise to the Supreme before he entered into                             the world arena. This promise was very simple and, at                             the same time, very soulful. His promise was to be the                             conscious instrument of the Supreme and to manifest                             the Supreme here on earth through his dedication, through                             his aspiration and through his conscious oneness with                             the world at large. This is the promise each aspiring                             soul has made, according to the seeker&#8217;s own vision.                             All human souls, without exception, make this promise                             to the Absolute Supreme. Unfortunately, when we enter                             into the world, we enter into the sea of ignorance.                             We bathe for thousands of years in this sea of ignorance,                             but when we become tired of this ignorance bath, we                             enter into the Sea of Knowledge and Wisdom. Then we                             remember our promise, our promise of God-manifestation                             on earth. Each individual being will one day come to                             realise that he has made this promise to the Absolute.</p>
<p> Unconsciously everybody is trying to fulfil this promise.                             But a seeker is trying consciously to fulfil it, and                             a realised soul has already begun to fulfil it consciously                             and unconditionally. A seeker of the highest Truth fulfils                             his promise consciously and soulfully. A spiritual Master                             fulfils his promise consciously and unconditionally.                             But the individual who is not aspiring and who does                             not care for God realisation or God manifestation right                             now, is fulfilling his promise unconsciously.</p>
<p> When one is fulfilling or trying to fulfil God consciously,                             he is fulfilling God in a perfect manner. When he is                             fulfilling God unconsciously, he is fulfilling God in                             an imperfect manner. When one has realised God consciously,                             one goes a step further and tries to reveal God consciously.                             Finally, one tries to manifest God consciously. In conscious                             realisation, conscious revelation and conscious manifestation,                             we see God the Eternal Perfection. God is for everyone,                             but one who is conscious of God&#8217;s Existence Reality                             is undoubtedly ahead in the divine race.</p>
<p> Each individual looks for something here on earth                             and there in Heaven. Here on earth we look for something                             in God. When we enter into the spiritual life, we pray                             to God, we meditate on God, we contemplate on God. First                             we start with our prayers. We learn how to pray from                             our parents. Then we try to concentrate on something                             which we want to achieve. We know that when our mind                             wanders we cannot achieve anything, whereas when we                             focus our attention and power of concentration on a                             particular thing we achieve success. We learn the art                             of concentration, then we go one step ahead to meditation.                             When we meditate, we try to embody the Vast, the Infinite                             within us, or we try to dive into the vast, infinite                             Sea of Light and Delight. The last step is contemplation.                             When we contemplate, our consciousness becomes one with                             the thing that we contemplate upon. The lover becomes                             one with the Beloved. The finite loses its finite existence                             and becomes one with the Infinite, becoming the Infinite                             itself. The earth bound consciousness becomes one with                             the Heaven free consciousness.</p>
<p> A seeker wants to see God. When he sees God face to                             face, he wants to see a certain thing in God, a special                             thing, and that thing is a sweet smile. Just by seeing                             God, he will not be satisfied. He wants to see God&#8217;s                             exquisite smile. If he sees that God is smiling at him,                             he will achieve everything. Then the seeker wants to                             see a certain thing in man and that thing is gratitude.                             He looks around. He feels that at every moment, consciously                             or unconsciously, he is offering something to mankind.                             He feels that if he can observe an iota of gratitude                             in mankind, then his self offering will be fulfilled.                             But mankind is not responding.</p>
<p> Then the seeker looks up to Heaven. He wants to see                             a certain thing in Heaven, and that thing is Compassion.                             He feels that if Heaven does not supply him with infinite                             Compassion, he is helpless. Although he has achieved                             something in life and the world extols him to the skies,                             he knows in the inmost recesses of his heart that he                             is helpless. He feels that if he gets more encouraging                             and fulfilling Compassion from Heaven, then he will                             be able to complete his task on earth most convincingly                             and powerfully.</p>
<p> The seeker expects something from earth. What does                             he expect? Patience. Earth has given him everything,                             but when he wants to do something for the earth consciousness,                             he feels that the earth consciousness is restless. It                             wants everything in the twinkling of an eye. He wants                             to see patience in the earth consciousness, and eventually                             there comes a time when the earth consciousness does                             have the necessary patience which permits him to manifest                             the highest truth on earth. The seeker expects something                             from his own life. What does he expect? Unconditional                             service to mankind. If he can serve mankind unconditionally,                             then he will be satisfied. If he serves conditionally,                             then he can never be satisfied or fulfilled. He expects                             from himself unconditional service to the world at large,                             and ultimately he grows into that unconditional service                             tree.</p>
<p> The seeker expects something when his present earth                             pilgrimage comes to an end. What does he expect? He                             expects the Song of Immortality. He feels that if he                             can hear the Song of Immortality, then he will someday                             achieve everything for the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p> Here we are all seekers. Now, there are two categories                             of seekers: mind seekers and heart seekers, or mental                             seekers and psychic seekers. The seekers who want to                             realise the Highest with the help of the mind, through                             the mind, eventually come to know that they are travelling                             on a very crowded train. This is the mind train. While                             they are travelling on the mind train, they see that                             with them are quite a few other passengers, and these                             passengers are fear, doubt, anxiety, jealousy and other                             negative and destructive forces. The train is overburdened.                             It goes slowly, very slowly, creeping sluggishly towards                             its destination. God alone knows when it will reach                             its journey&#8217;s goal. With utmost uncertainty the mind                             train crawls toward its destination. But those who want                             to realise the Highest through the heart and with the                             help of the heart travel on another train. That is the                             heart train. When the seeker travels on the heart train,                             there is nobody else with him. He is alone, he and the                             mounting flame of his aspiration. The train flies toward                             the destination at top speed because there are very                             few passengers weighing it down, and it reaches its                             destination sooner, much sooner than it even expects.</p>
<p> God is an eternal Player. We are His children, who                             are also playing in the Cosmic Game.</p>
<p> When we live in the physical, we play with sleep,                             day in and day out. Our consciousness is not awakened.</p>
<p> When we live in the vital, we play with depression                             and frustration. When we do not achieve our goal in                             the vital, we are frustrated and depressed; and when                             we do achieve our goal, we also feel frustrated and                             depressed, because we feel that it was something else                             we wanted.</p>
<p> When we live in the mind, we play with doubt. While                             playing with doubt, at times we feel that doubt is not                             a good partner, so we suffer a lot.</p>
<p> But there comes a time when faith looms large within                             us, and then we transfigure our mental doubt. On the                             strength of our inner faith, we begin to live in our                             heart and we play with surrender. Sometimes we surrender                             to the Absolute, sometimes we try to compel the Reality                             which we are praying for to surrender to us. And Reality,                             being all one, surrenders, because of our sincere inner                             cry. But when Reality enters into us in the form of                             aspiration, it makes us feel that by pleasing us in                             our own way, it will never be able to satisfy us. Only                             if we please the ultimate Reality in its own way can                             we be fulfilled. In the spiritual life, many times when                             we are pleased in our own way, we are not satisfied.                             Only when we are pleased in the way of the Divine, of                             the Supreme, can we be inwardly fulfilled. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we start our journey to please ourselves.                             In order to please ourselves, naturally we have to go                             through some discipline; for without discipline, we                             will not have any success. We have to follow mental,                             vital, psychic and spiritual discipline in order to                             see the face of inner satisfaction. Even when satisfaction                             looms large, we are not satisfied unless we please the                             Inner Pilot in His own way. Only then does real satisfaction,                             eternal satisfaction, dawn in our lives. We try to control                             our lives, we try to perfect our lives and that is good.                             But when we try to please the Inner Pilot in His own                             way on the strength of our unconditional surrender,                             when we make an unconditional surrender to His will,                             when we become His chosen instruments and fulfil Him                             in His own way, at that time we become perfect instruments.                             When today we have the inner dedication to say, &#8220;Let                             Thy Will be done,&#8221; tomorrow we will have the right                             to say, &#8220;I and my Father are one.&#8221;</p>
