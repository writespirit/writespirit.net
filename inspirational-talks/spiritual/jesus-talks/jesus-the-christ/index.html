				<p><b>Jesus Christ &#8211; Talks from the Gospels</b></p>
<p><b>Mount of Beatitudes<br />
Palestine<br />
33 AD</b></p>
<p>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain:&nbsp;<br />
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: [Matt 5:1]&nbsp;<br />
And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, [2]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [3]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. [4]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. [5]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. [6]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. [7]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. [8]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. [9]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness&#8217; sake:&nbsp;<br />
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [10]&nbsp;<br />
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,&nbsp;<br />
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. [11]&nbsp;<br />
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:&nbsp;<br />
for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. [12]&gt;&nbsp;<br />
Ye are the salt of the earth:&nbsp;<br />
but if the salt have lost his savour,&nbsp;<br />
wherewith shall it be salted?&nbsp;<br />
it is thenceforth good for nothing,&nbsp;<br />
but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. [13]&nbsp;<br />
Ye are the light of the world.&nbsp;<br />
A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. [14]&nbsp;<br />
Neither do men light a candle,&nbsp;<br />
and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick;&nbsp;<br />
and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. [15]&nbsp;<br />
Let your light so shine before men,&nbsp;<br />
that they may see your good works,&nbsp;<br />
and glorify your Father which is in heaven. [16]&nbsp;<br />
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:&nbsp;<br />
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. [17]&nbsp;<br />
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass,&nbsp;<br />
one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. [18]&nbsp;<br />
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,&nbsp;<br />
and shall teach men so,&nbsp;<br />
he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven:&nbsp;<br />
but whosoever shall do and teach them,&nbsp;<br />
the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [19]&nbsp;<br />
For I say unto you, That except your righteousness&nbsp;<br />
shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,&nbsp;<br />
ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. [20]&nbsp;<br />
Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time,&nbsp;<br />
Thou shalt not kill;&nbsp;<br />
and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: [21]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you,&nbsp;<br />
That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause&nbsp;<br />
shall be in danger of the judgment:&nbsp;<br />
and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca,&nbsp;<br />
shall be in danger of the council:&nbsp;<br />
but whosoever shall say, Thou fool,&nbsp;<br />
shall be in danger of hell fire. [22]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar,&nbsp;<br />
and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; [23]&nbsp;<br />
Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way;&nbsp;<br />
first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. [24]&nbsp;<br />
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him;&nbsp;<br />
lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,<br />
and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. [25]&nbsp;<br />
Verily I say unto thee,&nbsp;<br />
Thou shalt by no means come out thence,&nbsp;<br />
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. [26]&nbsp;<br />
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time,&nbsp;<br />
Thou shalt not commit adultery: [27]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you,&nbsp;<br />
That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her&nbsp;<br />
hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. [28]&nbsp;<br />
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:&nbsp;<br />
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,&nbsp;<br />
and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [29]&nbsp;<br />
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:&nbsp;<br />
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,&nbsp;<br />
and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [30]&nbsp;<br />
It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife,&nbsp;<br />
let him give her a writing of divorcement: [31]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,&nbsp;<br />
saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery:&nbsp;<br />
and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. [32]&nbsp;<br />
Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,&nbsp;<br />
Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: [33]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you, Swear not at all;&nbsp;<br />
neither by heaven; for it is God&#8217;s throne: [34]&nbsp;<br />
Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool:&nbsp;<br />
neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. [35]&nbsp;<br />
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head,&nbsp;<br />
because thou canst not make one hair white or black. [36]&nbsp;<br />
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay:&nbsp;<br />
for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. [37]&nbsp;<br />
Ye have heard that it hath been said,&nbsp;<br />
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: [38]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:&nbsp;<br />
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. [39]&nbsp;<br />
And if any man will sue thee at the law,&nbsp;<br />
and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. [40]&nbsp;<br />
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. [41]&nbsp;<br />
Give to him that asketh thee,&nbsp;<br />
and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. [42]&nbsp;<br />
Ye have heard that it hath been said,&nbsp;<br />
Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. [43]&nbsp;<br />
But I say unto you,&nbsp;<br />
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,&nbsp;<br />
do good to them that hate you,&nbsp;<br />
and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; [44]&nbsp;<br />
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:&nbsp;<br />
for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,&nbsp;<br />
and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. [45]&nbsp;<br />
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?&nbsp;<br />
do not even the publicans the same? [46]&nbsp;<br />
And if ye salute your brethren only,&nbsp;<br />
what do ye more than others?&nbsp;<br />
do not even the publicans so? [47]&nbsp;<br />
Be ye therefore perfect,&nbsp;<br />
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. [5:48]&nbsp;<br />
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:&nbsp;<br />
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. [6:1]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore when thou doest thine alms,&nbsp;<br />
do not sound a trumpet before thee,<br />
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,&nbsp;<br />
that they may have glory of men.&nbsp;<br />
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. [2]&nbsp;<br />
But when thou doest alms,&nbsp;<br />
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: [3]&nbsp;<br />
That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. [4]&nbsp;<br />
And when thou prayest,&nbsp;<br />
thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:&nbsp;<br />
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues&nbsp;<br />
and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.&nbsp;<br />
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. [5]&nbsp;<br />
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,&nbsp;<br />
and when thou hast shut thy door,&nbsp;<br />
pray to thy Father which is in secret;&nbsp;<br />
and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. [6]&nbsp;<br />
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:&nbsp;<br />
for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. [7]&nbsp;<br />
Be not ye therefore like unto them:&nbsp;<br />
for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. [8]&nbsp;<br />
After this manner therefore pray ye:&nbsp;<br />
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. [9]&nbsp;<br />
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. [10]&nbsp;<br />
Give us this day our daily bread. [11]&nbsp;<br />
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. [12]&nbsp;<br />
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:&nbsp;<br />
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.<br />
Amen. [13]&nbsp;<br />
For if ye forgive men their trespasses,&nbsp;<br />
your heavenly Father will also forgive you: [14]&nbsp;<br />
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,&nbsp;<br />
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. [15]&nbsp;<br />
Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance:&nbsp;<br />
for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.&nbsp;<br />
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. [16]&nbsp;<br />
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; [17]&nbsp;<br />
That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret:&nbsp;<br />
and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. [18]&nbsp;<br />
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,&nbsp;<br />
where moth and rust doth corrupt,&nbsp;<br />
and where thieves break through and steal: [19]&nbsp;<br />
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,&nbsp;<br />
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,&nbsp;<br />
and where thieves do not break through nor steal: [20]&nbsp;<br />
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. [21]&nbsp;<br />
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,&nbsp;<br />
thy whole body shall be full of light. [22]&nbsp;<br />
But if thine eye be evil,&nbsp;<br />
thy whole body shall be full of darkness.&nbsp;<br />
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,&nbsp;<br />
how great is that darkness! [23]&nbsp;<br />
No man can serve two masters:&nbsp;<br />
for either he will hate the one, and love the other;&nbsp;<br />
or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.&nbsp;<br />
Ye cannot serve God and mammon. [24]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore I say unto you,&nbsp;<br />
Take no thought for your life,&nbsp;<br />
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;&nbsp;<br />
nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.&nbsp;<br />
Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? [25]&nbsp;<br />
Behold the fowls of the air:&nbsp;<br />
for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;&nbsp;<br />
yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.&nbsp;<br />
Are ye not much better than they? [26]&nbsp;<br />
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? [27]&nbsp;<br />
And why take ye thought for raiment?&nbsp;<br />
Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;&nbsp;<br />
they toil not, neither do they spin: [28]&nbsp;<br />
And yet I say unto you,&nbsp;<br />
That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [29]&nbsp;<br />
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,&nbsp;<br />
which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,&nbsp;<br />
shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? [30]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore take no thought, saying,&nbsp;<br />
What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,&nbsp;<br />
Wherewithal shall we be clothed? [31]&nbsp;<br />
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)&nbsp;<br />
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. [32]&nbsp;<br />
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;&nbsp;<br />
and all these things shall be added unto you. [33]&nbsp;<br />
Take therefore no thought for the morrow:&nbsp;<br />
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.&nbsp;<br />
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. [6:34]&nbsp;<br />
Judge not, that ye be not judged. [7:1]&nbsp;<br />
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:&nbsp;<br />
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. [2]&nbsp;<br />
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&#8217;s eye,&nbsp;<br />
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? [3]&nbsp;<br />
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother,&nbsp;<br />
Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;&nbsp;<br />
and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? [4]&nbsp;<br />
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;&nbsp;<br />
and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother&#8217;s eye. [5]&nbsp;<br />
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,&nbsp;<br />
neither cast ye your pearls before swine,&nbsp;<br />
lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. [6]&nbsp;<br />
Ask, and it shall be given you;&nbsp;<br />
seek, and ye shall find;&nbsp;<br />
knock, and it shall be opened unto you: [7]&nbsp;<br />
For every one that asketh receiveth;&nbsp;<br />
and he that seeketh findeth;&nbsp;<br />
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. [8]&nbsp;<br />
Or what man is there of you,&nbsp;<br />
whom if his son ask bread,&nbsp;<br />
will he give him a stone? [9]&nbsp;<br />
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? [10]&nbsp;<br />
If ye then, being evil,&nbsp;<br />
know how to give good gifts unto your children,&nbsp;<br />
how much more shall your Father which is in heaven&nbsp;<br />
give good things to them that ask him? [11]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore all things whatsoever ye would&nbsp;<br />
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them:&nbsp;<br />
for this is the law and the prophets. [12]&nbsp;<br />
Enter ye in at the strait gate:&nbsp;<br />
for wide is the gate, and broad is the way,&nbsp;<br />
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: [13]&nbsp;<br />
Because strait is the gate,&nbsp;<br />
and narrow is the way,&nbsp;<br />
which leadeth unto life,&nbsp;<br />
and few there be that find it. [14]&nbsp;<br />
Beware of false prophets,&nbsp;<br />
which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing,&nbsp;<br />
but inwardly they are ravening wolves. [15]&nbsp;<br />
Ye shall know them by their fruits.&nbsp;<br />
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? [16]&nbsp;<br />
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit;&nbsp;<br />
but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. [17]&nbsp;<br />
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,&nbsp;<br />
neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. [18]&nbsp;<br />
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. [19]&nbsp;<br />
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. [20]&nbsp;<br />
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,&nbsp;<br />
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;&nbsp;<br />
but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. [21]&nbsp;<br />
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,&nbsp;<br />
have we not prophesied in thy name?&nbsp;<br />
and in thy name have cast out devils?&nbsp;<br />
and in thy name done many wonderful works? [22]&nbsp;<br />
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you:&nbsp;<br />
depart from me, ye that work iniquity. [23]&nbsp;<br />
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine,&nbsp;<br />
and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man,&nbsp;<br />
which built his house upon a rock: [24]&nbsp;<br />
And the rain descended, and the floods came,&nbsp;<br />
and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;&nbsp;<br />
and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. [25]&nbsp;<br />
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine,&nbsp;<br />
and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man,&nbsp;<br />
which built his house upon the sand: [26]&nbsp;<br />
And the rain descended, and the floods came,&nbsp;<br />
and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;&nbsp;<br />
and it fell: and great was the fall of it. [27]&nbsp;<br />
And it came to pass,&nbsp;<br />
when Jesus had ended these sayings,&nbsp;<br />
the people were astonished at his doctrine: [28]&nbsp;<br />
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. [29]&nbsp;</p>
