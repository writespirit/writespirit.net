<div class="stx">
<div class="line-block"></div>
<p>A young woman was bitterly sobbing and weeping over the dead body of her husband, who had been bitten by a snake. According to Indian tradition, when somebody dies of a snake bite, he cannot be cremated; the dead body has to be thrown into the water. So the man&#8217;s relatives had brought his body to the bank of the river, but the wife was weeping bitterly and did not want them to throw the body into the water. All of a sudden, Troilanga Swami appeared. Everybody knew that he was a great spiritual Master. He took some mud and clay from the Ganges, placed it on the spot where the man had been bitten by the snake and massaged it a little.</p>
<p>Then Troilanga Swami jumped into the water. In a few minutes, the man opened his eyes, looked around and asked why they had brought him there. Then the man and his wife went their way.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, death is powerful, but spiritual power is infinitely more powerful. It reminds death that death cannot mark the end of life, for it is God&#8217;s Will that life will eternally flow in and through death. In this story, God&#8217;s Compassion-Power overrules His Justice-Power.</p></blockquote>

<p>One day Troilanga Swami was walking along the street naked when a magistrate and his wife saw him. The wife was horrified and wanted to have him arrested. As the guards were about to arrest the Yogi, Troilanga Swami suddenly disappeared. There were many people surrounding him, so everyone was surprised that he could escape. After a short time, he appeared in the same spot, smiling. The magistrate got furious. &#8220;Why do you do this kind of thing?&#8221; he shouted. He insulted the Master mercilessly, saying, &#8220;You are such an odd-looking fellow! Why do you move around naked? Do you have no sense? You create so much nuisance for us!&#8221; But he let Troilanga Swami go.</p>
<p>That night the magistrate had a dream. In the dream he saw a sannyasi, wearing the skin of a tiger and holding a trident, running towards him to kill him. The sannyasi said to the magistrate, &#8220;How did you dare to insult Troilanga Swami? He is such a great spiritual Master. I shall not let you remain in this sanctified city of Benares.&#8221; The magistrate was frightened to death. He shouted out loud in his sleep, and his attendants came to his rescue and woke him up.</p>
<p>The following day the magistrate himself went to Troilanga Swami, placed himself at his feet and begged for forgiveness, which was immediately granted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>When one insults a God-realised Master, he incurs immediate retribution, not from the Master himself but from God, who loves the Master, His supreme instrument, more than He loves Himself. The Master forgives the culprits, for forgiveness is what he knows. But God, in spite of being His own Eternity&#8217;s and Infinity&#8217;s Forgiveness, does not allow His chosen instrument to be ridiculed and insulted, for His instrument is he who is of God and for God alone. After all, what God wants is always the constant manifestation of His own Truth-Light- Beauty.</p></blockquote>

<p>A great Indian King once went on a boat trip on the Ganges. He and his attendants saw a man swimming behind them. It was Troilanga Swami. It happened, in an hour or so, that Troilanga Swami swam near the boat smiling, so they helped him into the boat. He was naked as usual, but the people there did not mind because they all knew him, and had tremendous respect, love and veneration for him. The King was also pleased to see him, because he also admired him.</p>
<p>The King had a sword hanging around his waist. Troilanga Swami took it from him and examined it and played with it like a child. Then he suddenly threw it into the Ganges. The King was furious. He had received this sword for his valour and for his merit, so he felt miserable that he had lost such a precious thing. He wanted to punish the man but everybody protested: &#8220;Oh no, he is a saint; you can&#8217;t do that. It will be a terrible thing if you touch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The King said, &#8220;If you people are not willing to punish him, then once we land I will get other people who will gladly listen to me and punish this man.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were about to reach the shore, Troilanga Swami, who was seated in the boat, placed his hand in the water. All of a sudden two shining swords appeared in his hand. They were identical, and both looked exactly like the one he had thrown into the Ganges. Everybody was astonished. The Master said to the King, &#8220;O King, now find the one that belonged to you.&#8221; The King was totally nonplussed. He did not know which one was actually his. Then Troilanga Swami said to him, &#8220;You fool, you don&#8217;t know which one belongs to you? You don&#8217;t know your own possession?&#8221; Then he threw away the one that was not the King&#8217;s, and said, &#8220;In this world nothing will remain with you. When you die, everything you have will have to remain here. To the Real in you I say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t live in the world of enjoyment. Remain in the world of aspiration. Remain in the world of Light, Peace and Bliss. You are a King, but you are a fool as well. Be wise. Then only will you have true happiness in life. Be spiritually wise!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless and until we become spiritually wise, we shall never know what our true possession is. Our true possession, our eternal possession, our only possession, is our love of God. There cannot be anything else here on earth or there in Heaven for us to claim as our own. Only our love of God — our constant, soulful and self-giving love of God — can be our eternal possession. This possession will always remain safe, and we ourselves will also be safe only when we claim this possession as our own, very own.</p>
<p>Once we know that we have love of God in abundant, boundless and infinite measure, then God&#8217;s possession, which is His entire creation, immediately becomes our possession as well. Our love of God claims God, and the moment we offer our love to God, God&#8217;s creation immediately becomes ours as well. His entire creation comes from His Vision, and He and His Vision are inseparable. When we claim God with our love, God&#8217;s Concern and God&#8217;s creation immediately claim us; for the sole possessor is God and nobody else.</p></blockquote>

<p>Troilanga Swami and one of his dear disciples were meditating together on the bank of the Ganges. All of a sudden a terrible hurricane arose. The disciple said to the Master, &#8220;Let us go home. Let us hurry to our ashram.&#8221;</p>
<p>64 The Master said, &#8220;How can I go home now? Look at the pitiful condition of the passengers in that boat on the river. The boat is about to sink.&#8221;</p>
<p>65 The disciple said, &#8220;I also feel sorry for them, but what can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>66 In a few minutes&#8217; time the disciple saw the boat sink. He felt miserable and started crying for the passengers. Then he looked around. To his wide surprise he saw that his Master was missing. Then he felt totally miserable. The hurricane was in its full fury, the boat had sunk and his Master was not visible. He began praying to the Master to come back from wherever he had gone.</p>
<p>67 After a short time he saw the boat that had sunk come up again right in front of him with all the passengers, and inside the boat was also a naked man, Troilanga Swami. Before that moment, nobody in the boat had seen the Master. He had gone unseen and brought the boat and the passengers back to shore unharmed and safe. This was another of Troilanga Swami&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>A God-representative is he who embodies Eternity&#8217;s Compassion-Heart, Infinity&#8217;s Protection-Light and Immortality&#8217;s Illumination-Soul.</p></blockquote>
