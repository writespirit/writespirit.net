		<description><![CDATA[Heavenly Father The Divine


Our Heavenly Father spoke to me told me I am in his good graces
Warning not to listen to those with masks of lies upon their faces

He said he created  before any knowledge of time and space ever existed
Observed the hearts of many men and women have become dark and twisted

They the power hungry have driven our planet to war far too many times
Definition of man and the theory of evolution are not conclusive or defined

So many people make the claim of how revenge can be so  sweet
How will one feel entangled in the barbed wire oft their self defeat

The corrupt reigning powers have kept us on our very knees
In the night ring out the calls of them claiming innocence plea

 All of those  out there snakes may well have the power to charm
But they infiltrate the entire system causing chaos and harm

The planet and most of it&#039;s people have gone beyond contemplation
Who gave those permission to control and dominate every nation

When we were all children I an certain you got taught black from white
When time catches up don&#039;t pretend to not know wrong from right

No false cries  of the heart will be considered or acknowledged
All had your own free will all forms of hatred will be abolished

Most were all created with a heart a soul two hands and two feet
Not meant to Lord over other and sister bringing them to defeat

Hes sees a world where one is totally consumed with themselves
Walking over one another to gain  power and of course wealth

There is a well known book that has been added to and taken away from
Distorting many messages that came down from the almighty Kingdom Come

There exists  is an ancient  tablet referred to as the book of life
Written before Moses took Tizapora as his lawful wedded wife

It’s true every battle in from the pages of history will repeat itself
 Unfolding on on earth with a change to the s scenery but little else

The planet and most of it&#039;s people have become an abomination
Who gave those permission to control and dominate every nation

Ra will send his infallible armies from across the Egyptian sands
As the Divine reclaims ownership of sun earth sky and holy land

Our Lord  above is always watching over us day and night without fail
Our enemies will turn against each other as the snake swallows it&#039;s tail

Victoria BC 


The inner harbor has Welcome to Victoria spelled out in flowers
 A filth in the water that couldn’t be washed away in a strong shower

There is Madam Tussaud&#039;s museum full of figures of wax
Lived in that enchanted fairy tale long enough and never going back

It&#039;s a scenic place that looks as pretty as a postcard picture
Where those few of old money just want to become richer

By day the plastic people continuously  walk the city streets
Dressed in high fashion yet they are hollow in totally incomplete

The night streets dimly lit by lamp posts with hang baskets
Seven times the darkest souls tried to put me in my casket

 Ross Bay Cemetery beneath the tombstones worship the beast
Offering with their rituals bring an honest man to his knees

She devils at every Victoria bar striking their Jezebel pose
Angels hardly stand a chance when they wed one of those

 Dark forces with flashing lights control the city streets
It was like walking in hell until I got tired of the heat

place where tempters and temptresses will try to steal your heart
Show any sense of Godliness and they will try tear you apart

 Black Withes continually spin their webs of self loathing and hate
Spirits of the long dead they try to evoke it is love they desecrate 

The black prince and his entity did  once see me to my death
But I came back with a vengeance new eyes and new life breath

Victoria years ago I dubbed Sodom for reasons I am truly aware
A place where many worship the devil without a heart to care

The union of the draconian lead worship in their secret lair
In the  stone catacombs beneath Victoria&#039;s Bastion Square

I walk in spirit within similar footsteps to our very Lord
In heavy amour and carrying a blessed  ancient sword

True faith beats through one&#039;s heart and flows through the veins
Those who chose to worship dark secrets cannot say the same

The Fall of Queen Jezebel of Israel


We Were winged god&#039;s in love who flew heavenly skies
Until we answered the mortals of Israel’s false cries

Queen Jezebel captured us and sentenced us to a cell
Shackled us in heavy chains to better control our will

Jezebel clipped both our wings so we could no longer fly
Even if death came to call my love for you would never die

She the evil daughter to the wicked and beguiled king of Tyre
After his death to carry out is wishes she would readily aspire

One of her goals was to bring down all of heaven to earth
That she may gain power and control that was undeserved

Evil swept over the sands of Israel like an unholy sign
Ruling all and everything was what Jezebel had in mind

All of her Christian priests she cast away and put to death
So she could openly worship the evil prince Baal instead

 Just an empty vessel  claiming ownership to all she lacked
Through the worship of false idols and practicing witchcraft

 Queen Jezebel summoned all of the ancient powers of evil
Her goal was to overpower and enslave all of her people

Queen Jezebel must have truly possessed a heart of solid stone
Brought so much death and destruction  at her royal hand alone

Jezebel’s sexuality was much like her faces painted in lust
No doubt I would be with you again the only one I love and trust

She was so very vein and hungered for worldly goods and riches
She enlisted demons and blood sacrifices to fulfill her evil wishes

 Most of her people revolted against Queen Jezebel&#039;s wicked ways
Threw her from an open window to the hungry hounds in the lane

My weighing ankle chains become my constant reminder
 In the next cell was my love with a heart so much kinder

Endless days and seemingly everlasting dark nights passed by
Missing you so many tears I cried just wanting you at my side

Remember the night when we made our heavenly pact
Rather we died than pay homage to evil such as that

One day you with your brute strength broke me free of my chains
I knew that our short time our hearts spent apart was never in vein

Most of her people revolted against Queen Jezebel&#039;s wicked ways
Threw her from an open window to the hungry hounds in the lane

Absent of our wings we walked and saw Jezebel’s temple burn
Holding each other while counting the lessons that we learned

Wherever we walked in the dangerous world we are never apart
For your very spirit is with me and within my very heart

Still can see us standing together in a passionate embrace
Knowing we had conquered all the demons we had faced

We  share a spiritual bond  that can&#039;t be erased by sands of time
From the very time we first met my heart asked you to be mine

A Tale of Two Knights 


We were Knights brave warriors of the heart
Not even a sorcerer&#039;s spell could tear us apart

Made through life&#039;s cobwebs and found the truth
We drank from a chalice at the fountain of youth

Remember when we formed our eternal bond
Satisfying any desire we had  previously longed

We once paid a visit to the ancient tree of life
She led us on the path to a union free of strife

Love always must be genuine to be considered real
I will forget how good your embrace made me feel

We navigated enchanted woods with skill and ease
Always both knowing the forest for the trees

Neither of us ever made a wish at the wishing well
For We shared a love no gypsy woman could foretell

 Came upon Merlin who was black by day and white by night
We never allowed his  presence to enter our happy lives

The  lady of the lake  raised her sword blessed our love
She vowed that indeed we were protected from above

Recall when you would raise your axe and split the wood
In the firelight your angel&#039;s touch always did my body good

 To me you were never just a man or just a knight
You carried the flame that brought me everlasting light

Games of  jealousy and possession are truly as old as time
You gave me your heart simply because you wanted to be mine

Many thieves in the night have tried to steal our hearts
When we first met prayed that not one night we be apart

Our life was simple yet it was so fulfilling and good
In our log cabin nestled deep within Sherwood woods 

We were knights of the order of the round table
Many times into the trows of battle we were thrust

Both of us wore amour along with heavy chain mail
For the sanctity of our love many dragons we impaled

Forever grateful for you removed an arrow from my heart
Your loving hands allowed healing of heart and soul to start

Your kiss always kindled new fires from deep inside
 Into countless heavenly sunsets together we did ride

Snakes



The nights are governed by the cobra and other snakes
Power hungry it&#039;s ones money and life they intend to take

These ancient reptiles pass you on the street in disguise
Should you see through the mask keeping quite is wise

Their very mission is to gain ultimate global control
They possess some powers along with a very dark soul

Slithered through a portal from the third dimension
 Crimes over the centuries are far too many to mention

They were there in Egypt seen as the terrible asp
They enslaved the peoples and their evil took grasp

In Babylon they were worshiped as demon gods
The vipers broke all the sanctity and godly laws

Today they walk our streets they live thousands of years
Pass them and their very shadow is busy instilling fear

These venomous  snakes control and make most of our laws
And unfortunately many humans have joined their cause

If one shines the holy light into their evil eyes
Their darkness is shattered and their powers die

For those who insist on  judging a book by it&#039;s cover
One may well end up in bed with a snake as your lover
